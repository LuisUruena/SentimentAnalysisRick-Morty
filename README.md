# SentimentAnalysisRick-Morty 

The remarkable progress in the field of Big Data has driven the development of new technologies in natural language processing and data analysis.

Text mining is a fascinating application of data analysis that extracts relevant information from related writings in different linguistic contexts. And therefore, in natural language processing, sentiment analysis and classification stands out as a key application supported by text mining. Through the extraction of information from textual data, it becomes possible to identify and comprehend the sentiments and emotions conveyed.

In this end-of-degree work, we analyze and classify the dialogue of characters in an English-language television series as Rick and Morty using Python. The objective is to identify and categorize the feelings and emotions expressed in the text, comparing the human perception of the characters' personalities with the results obtained using natural language processing techniques.
