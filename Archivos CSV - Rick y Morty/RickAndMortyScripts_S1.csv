1;1;Pilot;Rick;Morty! You gotta come on. Jus'... you gotta come with me.
1;1;Pilot;Morty;What, Rick? What’s going on?
1;1;Pilot;Rick;I got a surprise for you, Morty.
1;1;Pilot;Morty;It's the middle of the night. What are you talking about?
1;1;Pilot;Rick;Come on, I got a surprise for you.  Come on, hurry up.
1;1;Pilot;Morty;Ow! Ow! You're tugging me too hard!
1;1;Pilot;Rick;We gotta go, gotta get outta here, come on. Got a surprise for you Morty.
1;1;Pilot;Rick;What do you think of this... flying vehicle, Morty? I built it outta stuff I found in the garage.
1;1;Pilot;Morty;Yeah, Rick... I-it's great. Is this the surprise?
1;1;Pilot;Rick;Morty. I had to... I had to do it. I had— I had to— I had to make a bomb, Morty. I had to create a bomb.
1;1;Pilot;Morty;What?! A bomb?!
1;1;Pilot;Rick;We're gonna drop it down there just get a whole fresh start, Morty. Create a whole fresh start.
1;1;Pilot;Morty;T-t-that's absolutely crazy!
1;1;Pilot;Rick;Come on, Morty. Just take it easy, Morty. It's gonna be good. Right now, we're gonna go pick up your little friend Jessica.
1;1;Pilot;Morty;Jessica? From my math class?
1;1;Pilot;Rick;When I drop the bomb you know, I want you to have somebody, you know? I want you to have the thing. I'm gonna make it like a new Adam and Eve, and you're gonna be Adam.
1;1;Pilot;Morty;Ohh...
1;1;Pilot;Rick;And Jessica's gonna be Eve.
1;1;Pilot;Morty;Whhhh-wha?
1;1;Pilot;Rick;And so that's the surprise, Morty.
1;1;Pilot;Morty;No, you can't!  Jessica doesn't even know I exist! But—but, but forget about that, because you can't blow up humanity!
1;1;Pilot;Rick;I-I get what you're trying to say, Morty. Listen, I'm not...  You don't got... Y-you don’t gotta worry about me trying to fool around with Jessica or mess around with Jessica or anything. I'm not that kind of guy, Morty.
1;1;Pilot;Morty;What are you talking about, Rick?
1;1;Pilot;Rick;You-you don't have to worry about me getting with Jessica or anything. Sh-sh-she— she, she, she's all for you, Morty.
1;1;Pilot;Morty;I don't care about Jessica! Y-Yyyyyyyyyyou—
1;1;Pilot;Rick;You know what, Morty? You're right.  Let's forget the girl altogether. She, she's probably nothing but trouble, anyways.
1;1;Pilot;Morty;That's it... that's it, Rick. I'm taking the wheel.
1;1;Pilot;Rick;Get off of me, Morty!
1;1;Pilot;Morty;I'm taking charge of this situation, buddy!  I'm put—I’m, I'm, I'm, I'm puttin’... I-I’m, I’m, I’m not gonna stand around like some sort of dumb... dumb person and just le-let you ruin the whole world!
1;1;Pilot;Rick;Come on! What’s gotten into you? If you love Earth so much why don’t you marry it?  What are you, crazy? Alright, alright, Morty.
1;1;Pilot;Rick;Alright. I'll-I'll land. I'll land. I'll land. I'll land the thing. I’ll land the thing. Big tough guy all of a sudden.
1;1;Pilot;Rick;We'll park it right here, Morty. Right here on the side of the ree... road here.
1;1;Pilot;Morty;Oh, thank god.
1;1;Pilot;Rick;You know what? That was all a test, Morty. Just an elaborate test to make you more assertive.
1;1;Pilot;Morty;It was?
1;1;Pilot;Rick;Sure. Why not? I don’t, I don't know. Y-you know what, Mo—
1;1;Pilot;Morty;Um...
1;1;Pilot;Jerry;I see there's a new episode of that singing show tonight. Who do you guys think is gonna be the best singer?
1;1;Pilot;Summer;Oh my God, his head is in his food. I'm going to puke.
1;1;Pilot;Beth;Morty, are you getting sick?  I told you not to practice-kiss the living room pillow. The dog sleeps on it.
1;1;Pilot;Morty;I wasn't kissing a pillow, mom. I just I didn't get a lot of sleep last night. Maybe my dreams were just too loud or something.
1;1;Pilot;Summer;Or maybe you were out all night again with Grandpa Rick.
1;1;Pilot;Jerry;What?
1;1;Pilot;Beth;Dad?
1;1;Pilot;Rick;What, so everyone's supposed to sleep every single night now? You realize that nighttime makes up half of all time?
1;1;Pilot;Jerry;Damn it!
1;1;Pilot;Beth;Jerry!
1;1;Pilot;Jerry;Beth!
1;1;Pilot;Summer;Oh my god, my parents are so loud, I want to die.
1;1;Pilot;Rick;Mm, there is no God, Summer. You gotta rip that band-aid off now. You'll thank me later.
1;1;Pilot;Jerry;Okay, with all due respect, Rick— what am I talking about? What respect is due? How is my son supposed to pass his classes if you keep dragging him off for high-concept Sci-Fi rigamarole?
1;1;Pilot;Rick;"Listen, Jerry. I-I-I don't want to overstep my bounds or anything. It's your house. It's your world. You're a real Julius Caesar but I'll tell you something—tell you how I feel about school, Jerry. It's a waste of time.  Buncha people running around, bumping into each other. G-guy up front says, ""two plus two."" The people in the back say, ""four."" Then the—then the bell rings, and they give you a carton of milk and a piece of paper that says you can go take a dump or something. I mean, it's not a place for smart people, Jerry. And I know that's not a popular opinion, but it's my two cents on the issue.  This was a good breakfast, Beth. You really made the crap out of those eggs. I wish your mother was here to eat them."
1;1;Pilot;Beth;Oh, dad…
1;1;Pilot;Jerry;What? For real?
1;1;Pilot;Mr. Goldenfold;Alright, now, everybody get settled. Get away from the windows!
1;1;Pilot;Mr. Goldenfold;Now, look, we're gonna be dealing with some real serious stuff today. You might have heard of it. It's called math? And without it, none of us would even exist, so let's jump right in. Two plus two.
1;1;Pilot;Morty;Jessica.
1;1;Pilot;Mr. Goldenfold;Five plus five.
1;1;Pilot;Morty;Jessica.
1;1;Pilot;Mr. Goldenfold;Okay, good. It's time for the quiz.
1;1;Pilot;Mr. Goldenfold;Yeah, you know what?! Aw, too bad! Tough! First row, take one. Pass it back for me. The stakes are high in this room.  There's crucial things happening here every day. People getting smarter. Some of y'all getting dumber. Some of y'all ain't gonna see 3
1;1;Pilot;Jessica;Hi, Morty.
1;1;Pilot;Morty;Whoa! Hi, Jessica.
1;1;Pilot;Jessica;Can I show these to you?
1;1;Pilot;Morty;Wow. Th-they're both great. Thank you!
1;1;Pilot;Jessica;You know what I named these? My little Morties.
1;1;Pilot;Morty;Uh, that's flattering... and a little weird.
1;1;Pilot;Jessica;Do you know what I want you to do with them?
1;1;Pilot;Morty;Rename them?
1;1;Pilot;Jessica;Squeeze them. Manhandle them. Give them the business. See if you can shuffle them. I mean, really get in there and knock them around. No wrong answers.
1;1;Pilot;Morty;Wow. Well, okay, Jessica. L-let's give this a shot.
1;1;Pilot;Jessica;Mm. Oh, Morty. What are you doing to me?
1;1;Pilot;Morty;Uh, I-I'm just doing my best.
1;1;Pilot;Mr. Goldenfold;Morty! What are you doing to me?!
1;1;Pilot;Morty;Ah, Jessica.
1;1;Pilot;Mr. Goldenfold;Morty!
1;1;Pilot;Morty;Jessica.
1;1;Pilot;Mr. Goldenfold;Five more minutes of this, and I'm gonna get mad.
1;1;Pilot;Morty;Je-Jessica. Jessica.
1;1;Pilot;Mr. Goldenfold;Not my fault this is happening.
1;1;Pilot;Morty;Uh, morning, Frank.
1;1;Pilot;Morty;Oh, geez, Frank. I don't know if a knife is necessary. I mean, you know, y-you kind of had things handled without it.
1;1;Pilot;Rick;There you are, Morty. Listen to me. I got an errand to run in a whole different dimension. I need an extra pair of hands.
1;1;Pilot;Morty;Oh, geez, Rick. W-w-what'd you do to Frank?
1;1;Pilot;Rick;It's pretty obvious, Morty. I froze him. Now listen I need your help, Morty. I mean, we got we got to get get the hell out of here and go take care of business.  It's important. Come on, Morty.
1;1;Pilot;Morty;I don't know, Rick. I can't leave school again.
1;1;Pilot;Rick;Do you have any concept of how much higher the stakes get out there, Morty? What do you think I can just do it all by myself? Come on!
1;1;Pilot;Morty;Aw, geez. Okay. I guess I can skip history. What about Frank? I mean, shouldn't you unfreeze him?
1;1;Pilot;Rick;I'll do it later, Morty. He'll be fine. Let's go.
1;1;Pilot;Summer;Hi, Frank.
1;1;Pilot;Summer;AAAAAAAAAAAHHHHH!!!!!!!
1;1;Pilot;Beth;Scalpel.
1;1;Pilot;Jerry;Knock, knock.
1;1;Pilot;Beth;Jerry?
1;1;Pilot;Jerry;"My manager gave me an hour for lunch, and I thought, ""hey, why not swing by where your wife works?"""
1;1;Pilot;Beth;Jerry, please tell me you're here for an incredibly urgent reason.
1;1;Pilot;Jerry;Well, it's lunch. I mean, it's one of three meals that have existed for millennia.
1;1;Pilot;Beth;Okay, I only ask, Jerry, because, as you know, my job involves performing heart surgery.
1;1;Pilot;Jerry;Well, yeah, on horses.
1;1;Pilot;Beth;Excuse me?
1;1;Pilot;Jerry;Okay, Let's not rehash that fight. I sense that you're busy and will now be on my way.
1;1;Pilot;Jerry;Whoa! What is this on the floor? Some kind of literature for a really nice-looking nursing home. Hey, honey, crazy idea bad pitch let's put your dad here. Let's put your dad in a nursing home.
1;1;Pilot;Beth;Hey, Tom! We know when we're losing him. WE CAN HEAR THE BEEPS!
1;1;Pilot;Rick;There she is. All right. Come on, Morty. Let's go.
1;1;Pilot;Morty;Oh, geez, okay.
1;1;Pilot;Morty;Oh, man, Rick. What is this place?
1;1;Pilot;Rick;It's Dimension 35-C, and it's got the perfect climate conditions for a special type of tree, Morty, called a Mega Tree, and there's fruit in those trees, and there's seeds in those fruits. I'm talking about Mega Seeds. They're they're incredibly powerful, and I need them to help me with my research, Morty.
1;1;Pilot;Morty;Oh, man, Rick. I'm looking around this place, and I'm starting to work up some anxiety about this whole thing.
1;1;Pilot;Rick;All right, all right, calm down. Listen to me, Morty. I know that new situations can be intimidating. You're looking around, and it's all scary and different, but, you know, m-meeting them head on, charging right into them like a bull that's how we grow as people. I'm no stranger to scary situations. I deal with them all the time. Now, if you just stick with me, Morty, we're gonna be—
1;1;Pilot;Rick;HOLY CRAP, MORTY RUN!!!
1;1;Pilot;Rick;I never seen that thing before in my life. I don't even know what the hell it is! We got to get out of here, Morty! It's gonna kill us! We're gonna die! We're gonna die, Morty!
1;1;Pilot;Rick;Oh, Morty, take a deep breath. Breathe that breathe that fresh air in, Morty. Y-you smell that? That's the smell of adventure, Morty. That's that's the smell of-of-of-of a whole different evolutionary timeline.
1;1;Pilot;Morty;All right, Rick, look how much longer is this gonna be? Shouldn't I be back at school by now?
1;1;Pilot;Rick;Are you joking me? I mean, look at all the crazy crap surrounding us. Look at that thing right there.  What the hell is that thing? You think you're gonna see that kind of thing at school?  Look at it just lumbering around.  It defies all logic, that thing.
1;1;Pilot;Morty;Yeah, Rick, I get it. We're surrounded by monsters. That's kind of the reason why I want to leave.
1;1;Pilot;Rick;Ta-ta-ta-ta-ta-ta. Morty, you see this?
1;1;Pilot;Rick;You see what we just stumbled upon, Morty? Any idea what that is down there?
1;1;Pilot;Morty;The mega trees?
1;1;Pilot;Rick;That's right, Morty the mega trees with the mega fruit on them and that's what I'm talking about, Morty. That's where my seeds are. If we would have done what you wanted, I would have never have found them, because you're so in love with school.
1;1;Pilot;Morty;All right, all right. So, what's so special about these seeds, anyways?
1;1;Pilot;Rick;You ask a lot of questions, Morty. Not very charismatic. It makes you kind of an  under-  underfoot figure.
1;1;Pilot;Rick;Just take these shoes, Morty. They're  special grappling shoes. When you're wearing these things, these babies, you can basically just walk on any surface you want, Morty up, down, below, turn around to the left. These things really bring it all together.
1;1;Pilot;Morty;AAAAAAAHHHH!!!!!!
1;1;Pilot;Rick;You have to turn them on, Morty! The shoes have to be turned on!
1;1;Pilot;Beth;I am not putting my father in a home! He just came back into my life, and you want to grab him and stuff him under a mattress like last month's Victoria's Secret?
1;1;Pilot;Jerry;I told you I was ordering you something for Valentine's Day. More importantly, your father is a horrible influence on our son.
1;1;Pilot;Beth;It's fine, Davin.
1;1;Pilot;Jerry;Since we're fighting, if you ever have an affair with that guy, I will come to the hotel room and blow my brains out all over your naked bodies.
1;1;Pilot;Beth;Look, I appreciate the stress you're under, but Morty was having trouble in school way before my dad moved in, and the only influence I can see Rick having is that, for the first time in his life, Morty has a friend.
1;1;Pilot;Jerry;Well, maybe you're right.
1;1;Pilot;Beth;Uh, yeah, maybe I am. I'm my father's daughter. I'm smart. Why do you think I'm a heart surgeon?
1;1;Pilot;Jerry;Ahem, Horse heart surgeon.
1;1;Pilot;Principal Vagina;Hello? Mrs. Smith? This is Principal Vagina, no relation. I wonder if you and Morty's father might be able to have a chat with me this afternoon?
1;1;Pilot;Rick;Morty, oh, you really d-did a number on  your legs right now. You know, you got to turn  the shoes on, Morty, for them to work. Yeah, look I turned mine on. I had no problem getting down here. It was a leisurely breeze.
1;1;Pilot;Morty;I'm in a lot of pain, Rick!
1;1;Pilot;Rick;Yeah, I can see that. But do you think you'll still be able to help me collect my seeds, Morty?
1;1;Pilot;Morty;Are you kidding me?! That's it, Rick! That's the last straw! I can't believe this! I'm sitting here with both of my legs broken, and you're still asking me about getting those seeds?! Ooh! Ow! Oh! Y-y-you're a monster. Y-you're like Hitler, but-but even Hitler cared about Germany or something.
1;1;Pilot;Rick;Okay, hold on just a second, Morty.
1;1;Pilot;Morty;Ooh! Ohh! Ooh! Hnngh! Hoo! Ooh! Ohh! Aaaaagh! Oooooh!
1;1;Pilot;Morty;Ooh, Ohh, Ooh. Wow, Rick. That stuff just healed my broken legs instantly. I mean, I've never felt so good in my life. Thank you.
1;1;Pilot;Rick;Don't worry about it, Morty. Just come help me get these seeds, all right, buddy?
1;1;Pilot;Morty;Sure thing, Rick.
1;1;Pilot;Rick;Not that you asked, Morty, but what just happened there is I went into a future dimension with such advanced medicine that they had broken-leg serum at every corner drugstore.  The stuff was all over the place, Morty.
1;1;Pilot;Morty;Wow, that's pretty crazy, Rick.
1;1;Pilot;Rick;There's just one problem, Morty one little hang-up. The dimension I visited was so advanced, that  they had also halted the aging process, and everyone there was young, Morty, and they had been forever. I was the only old person there, Morty.  It was like I was some sort of, you know, celebrity, walking around. I-I was fascinating to them. There were a lot of attractive women there, Morty, and they-they-they— they all wanted time with me. I had a lot of fun with a lot of young ladies, but I spent so much time there, my interdimensional portal device it's got no charge left, Morty. It's got no charge left.
1;1;Pilot;Morty;What?!
1;1;Pilot;Rick;It's as good as garbage, Morty. It's not gonna work anymore, Morty.
1;1;Pilot;Morty;Oh, geez, Rick, that's not good. W-what are we gonna do? I-I have to be back at school right now. How are we gonna get back home?
1;1;Pilot;Rick;There's ways to get back home, Morty. It's just it's just gonna be a little bit of a hassle. We're gonna have to go through interdimensional customs, so you're gonna have to do me a real solid.
1;1;Pilot;Morty;Uh-oh.
1;1;Pilot;Rick;When we get to customs, I'm gonna need you to take these seeds into the bathroom, and I'm gonna need you to put them way up inside your butthole, Morty.
1;1;Pilot;Morty;In my butt?
1;1;Pilot;Rick;Put them way up inside there, as far as they can fit.
1;1;Pilot;Morty;Oh, geez, Rick. I really don't want to have to do that.
1;1;Pilot;Rick;Well, somebody's got to do it, Morty. Th-these seeds aren't gonna get through customs unless they're in someone's rectum, Morty
1;1;Pilot;Morty;Uuuh.
1;1;Pilot;Rick;And they'll fall right out of mine. I've done this too many times, Morty. I mean, you're young. Y-y-you've got your whole life ahead of you, and your anal cavity is still taut, yet malleable. You got to do it for grandpa, Morty. Y-  you've got to put these seeds inside your butt.
1;1;Pilot;Morty;In my butt?
1;1;Pilot;Rick;Come on, Morty. Please, Morty. You have to do it, Morty.
1;1;Pilot;Morty;Oh, man.
1;1;Pilot;Principal Vagina;The fact is, your son, Morty, has attended this school for a total of seven hours over the last two months.
1;1;Pilot;Beth;What? Why didn't you notify us?
1;1;Pilot;Principal Vagina;I done been notifying you. Have you not been getting the messages I've been leaving with Morty's grandfather?
1;1;Pilot;Jerry;Boom! Told you! In your face! He is ruining our child! Wait, what am I celebrating?
1;1;Pilot;Principal Vagina;Yeah, see, I thought something was fishy there, because it's usually Morty's grandpa that's taking him out of school.
1;1;Pilot;Beth;Summer?
1;1;Pilot;Summer;What kind of God lets this happen?
1;1;Pilot;Principal Vagina;We had a little incident. A student was frozen to death.  And there's no evidence that a Latino student did it! Everyone wants to take this to a racial place. I won't let them.
1;1;Pilot;Announcer;The glarp zone is for flarping and unglarping only.
1;1;Pilot;Announcer;The glarp zone is for flarping and unglarping only.
1;1;Pilot;Rick;I don't like it here, Morty. I can't abide bureaucracy. I don't like being told where to go and what to do. I consider it a violation. Did you get those seeds all the way up your butt?
1;1;Pilot;Morty;Yeah, Rick. Let's just get this over with, okay? I mean, these things are pointy. They hurt.
1;1;Pilot;Rick;That means they're good ones. You're a good kid, Morty. Those mega seeds are super valuable to my work. You've been a huge help to me. I'm gonna be able to do a-
1;1;Pilot;Rick;Why does he have to go over there?
1;1;Pilot;Rick;What new-  what new machine?
1;1;Pilot;Rick;Run, Morty! Run!
1;1;Pilot;Morty;Aaaaaah!
1;1;Pilot;Morty;Ohhhhh!
1;1;Pilot;Morty;Ohhhhhh!
1;1;Pilot;Morty;Aaaaah!
1;1;Pilot;Rick;Don't think about it!
1;1;Pilot;Rick;Ooh! Oh, nice, Morty! The student becomes the teacher.
1;1;Pilot;Morty;Whoooooo!
1;1;Pilot;Rick;I need to type in the coordinates to our home world, Morty. Cover me.
1;1;Pilot;Morty;Oh, man. I mean, you know, I-I don't want to shoot nobody.
1;1;Pilot;Rick;They're just robots, Morty! It's okay to shoot them! They're robots!
1;1;Pilot;Morty;They're not robots, Rick!
1;1;Pilot;Rick;It's a figure of speech, Morty. They're bureaucrats. I don't respect them. Just keep shooting, Morty. You have no idea what prison is like here!
1;1;Pilot;Morty;Holy crap! This is insane!
1;1;Pilot;Rick;Come on, Morty! We got to get the hell out of here!
1;1;Pilot;Jessica;Wow. Did you just come into the cafeteria through a portal?
1;1;Pilot;Morty;Uh, yeah. Well, you know, my-my Ferrari's in the shop.  Just kidding.
1;1;Pilot;Jessica;You're Morty, right?
1;1;Pilot;Morty;Yeah.
1;1;Pilot;Rick;You can get his number later. Come on, Morty. We got to get out of here. You got to get those seeds out of your ass.
1;1;Pilot;Jerry;Oh, look, honey. It's our son with Albert Ein-douche.
1;1;Pilot;Beth;What?
1;1;Pilot;Jerry;I'm an angry father, not an improviser.
1;1;Pilot;Rick;Oh, hi, Jerry. Oh, my goodness, Morty! What are you doing out of class? We talked about this. Your-your parents and I are very disappointed in-in this behavior... No? No takers?
1;1;Pilot;Rick;You guys should really not be touching that stuff. It's beyond your reasoning.
1;1;Pilot;Jerry;You're beyond our reasoning!
1;1;Pilot;Rick;Takes one to know one.
1;1;Pilot;Beth;Dad, how could you make my son miss an entire semester of school? I mean, it's not like he's a hot girl. He can't just bail on his life and set up shop in someone else's.
1;1;Pilot;Rick;What what are you guys doing with my stuff?
1;1;Pilot;Beth;We're moving you to a nursing home.
1;1;Pilot;Rick;A nursing home? What are what are you, nuts? I'm a genius. I build robots for fun.
1;1;Pilot;Jerry;Well, now you can build baskets and watch Paul Newman movies on VHS and mentally scar the Boy Scouts every Christmas.
1;1;Pilot;Beth;What does that mean?
1;1;Pilot;Jerry;It's personal.
1;1;Pilot;Morty;Dad, mom, come on. Rick just needed my help is all.
1;1;Pilot;Jerry;Morty, stay out of this. You are obviously not capable of judging these situations on your own.
1;1;Pilot;Rick;What are you trying to say about Morty? That he's stupid or something?
1;1;Pilot;Beth;Oh, don't high-road us, dad. You know fully well that Morty is the last child that needs to be missing classes.
1;1;Pilot;Rick;I-I-I don't know what you mean by that. Can can can you be a little bit more specific?
1;1;Pilot;Jerry;Oh, for crying out—he's got some kind of disability or something. Is that what you want us to say?
1;1;Pilot;Morty;I do?
1;1;Pilot;Jerry;Well, duh doy, son. Look, I love you, Morty, but we both know you're not as fast as the other kids, and if you want to compete in this world, you got to work twice as hard.
1;1;Pilot;Morty;Aw, geez, dad. Y-you know, that's a lot to drop on a kid all at once.
1;1;Pilot;Rick;Morty, t-tell your parents the square root of pi.
1;1;Pilot;Morty;Oh, come on, Rick. You know I can't.
1;1;Pilot;Rick;The square root of Pi, Morty. Go!
1;1;Pilot;Morty;1.77245385... Whoa!
1;1;Pilot;Beth;What the hell?
1;1;Pilot;Jerry;Holy crap. He's right.
1;1;Pilot;Rick;Morty, tell your parents the first law of Thermodynamics.
1;1;Pilot;Morty;"""The increment in the internal energy of a system is equal to the increment of heat supplied to the system."" Wow! I'm so smart!"
1;1;Pilot;Jerry;But—
1;1;Pilot;Rick;I told the both of you school is stupid. It's not how you learn things. Morty's a gifted child. He has a special mind. That's why he's my little helper. He's like me. He's gonna be doing great science stuff later in his life. He's too smart for school. He needs to keep hanging out and helping me.
1;1;Pilot;Beth;Jerry, I don't want whatever's happening here to stop.
1;1;Pilot;Jerry;No, I-I understand. Uh, maybe we overreacted. But he has to keep going to school.
1;1;Pilot;Rick;Okay, Jerry. You drive a hard bargain, but what am I supposed to do? Say no? You-you really wear the pants around here. I just want you to know, between us, from now on, it's gonna be clear communication.
1;1;Pilot;Summer;Frank Palicky was frozen to death today!
1;1;Pilot;Rick;No idea what you're talking about.
1;1;Pilot;Jerry;Okay. Well, uh, Morty, it's your bedtime in an hour. Don't stay up all night again. This is good, though. This can work. I think we can be a family and now, Beth, if you'll have me, I would love to have you.
1;1;Pilot;Beth;You know what? Okay.
1;1;Pilot;Morty;Holy cow, Rick. I didn't know hanging out with you was making me smarter.
1;1;Pilot;Rick;Full disclosure, Morty it's not. Temporary superintelligence is just a side effect of the mega seeds dissolving in your rectal cavity.
1;1;Pilot;Morty;Aw, man.
1;1;Pilot;Rick;Yeah, and once those seeds wear off, you're gonna lose most of your motor skills, and you're also gonna lose a significant amount of brain functionality for 72 hours, Morty.
1;1;Pilot;Morty;Ohh, man.  Oh, geez! Ohh.
1;1;Pilot;Rick;I'm sorry, Morty. It's a bummer. In reality, you're as dumb as they come and I needed those seeds real bad, and I had to give them up just to get your parents off my back, so now we're gonna have to go get more adventures.  And then we're gonna go on even more adventures after that, Morty and you're gonna keep your mouth shut about it, Morty, because the world is full of idiots that don't understand what's important, and they'll tear us apart, Morty but if you stick with me, I'm gonna accomplish great things, Morty, and you're gonna be part of them, and together, we're gonna run around, Morty. We're gonna do all kinds of wonderful things, Morty. Just you and me, Morty. The outside world is our enemy, Morty. We're the only friends we've got, Morty. It's just Rick and Morty. Rick and Morty and their adventures, Morty. Rick and Morty forever and forever. Morty's things. Me and Rick and Morty running around, and Rick and Morty time. All day long, forever. All a hundred days. Rick and Morty forever 100 times. Over and over, rickandmortyadventures.com. All 100 years. Every minute, rickandmorty.com.
1;2;Lawnmower Dog;Jerry;What? Why are you looking at me? You want to go outside? Outside?
1;2;Lawnmower Dog;Jerry;Outside?
1;2;Lawnmower Dog;Jerry;Are you kidding me?! Come on!
1;2;Lawnmower Dog;Summer;Oh, my God.
1;2;Lawnmower Dog;Morty;What's wrong?
1;2;Lawnmower Dog;Jerry;Your idiot dog!
1;2;Lawnmower Dog;Morty;Oh, he he didn't mean it, dad. Did you, snuffles? You're a good boy.
1;2;Lawnmower Dog;Jerry;Don't praise him now, Morty! He just peed on the carpet! Bad dog! Bad!
1;2;Lawnmower Dog;Rick;Morty, come on. I need your help tonight.
1;2;Lawnmower Dog;Jerry;Hey, wait, hold on a second, Rick. You wouldn't by any chance have some sort of crazy science thing you could whip up that might help make this dog a little smarter, would you?
1;2;Lawnmower Dog;Rick;I thought the whole point of having a dog was to feel superior, Jerry. If I were you, I wouldn't pull that thread. Come on, Morty.
1;2;Lawnmower Dog;Jerry;Listen, Rick, if you're gonna stay here rent-free and use my son for your stupid science, the least you could do is put a little bit of it to use for the family. You make that dog smart or Morty's grounded!
1;2;Lawnmower Dog;Summer;Ha-ha!
1;2;Lawnmower Dog;Morty;Aw, man!
1;2;Lawnmower Dog;Rick;Boy, you really got me up against a wall this time, Jerry.
1;2;Lawnmower Dog;Rick;All right, Ruffles What's his name?
1;2;Lawnmower Dog;Morty;Snuffles.
1;2;Lawnmower Dog;Rick;Snuffles, shake.
1;2;Lawnmower Dog;Rick;Roll over.
1;2;Lawnmower Dog;Rick;Go to the bathroom.
1;2;Lawnmower Dog;Jerry;Holy crap!
1;2;Lawnmower Dog;Summer;No way.
1;2;Lawnmower Dog;Rick;Yeah, you're at the top of your game now, Jerry. Have fun. Come on, Morty.
1;2;Lawnmower Dog;Morty;That was fantastic, Rick!
1;2;Lawnmower Dog;Rick;Yeah, Morty, if you like that, boy, you're you're really going to flip your lid over this one.
1;2;Lawnmower Dog;Morty;W-w-w-what is it?
1;2;Lawnmower Dog;Rick;It's a device, Morty, that when you put it in your ear, you can enter people's dreams, Morty. It's just like that movie that you keep crowing about.
1;2;Lawnmower Dog;Morty;"You talking about ""Inception""?"
1;2;Lawnmower Dog;Rick;That's right, Morty. This is gonna be a lot like that, except, you know, it's gonna may--be make sense.
1;2;Lawnmower Dog;Morty;"""Inception"" made sense."
1;2;Lawnmower Dog;Rick;You don't have to try to impress me, Morty. Listen, tonight we're gonna go into the home of your math teacher, Mr. Goldenfold, and we're gonna incept the idea in his brain to give you A's in math, Morty. That way you can, you know, y-you're gonna help me with my science, Morty, all the time.
1;2;Lawnmower Dog;Morty;Geez, Rick, in the time it took you to make this thing, couldn't you have just, you know, helped me with my homework?
1;2;Lawnmower Dog;Rick;Are you listening to me, Morty? Homework is stupid. The whole point is to get less of it.
1;2;Lawnmower Dog;Rick;Come on, let's just get over there and deal with this thing. W-we're gonna incept your teacher. You're frustrating me.
1;2;Lawnmower Dog;Mrs. Pancakes;You don't know me!
1;2;Lawnmower Dog;Mr. Goldenfold;' Nice, Mrs. Pancakes real nice.
1;2;Lawnmower Dog;Mrs. Pancakes;You don't know me!
1;2;Lawnmower Dog;Rick;Uh-oh! Spoilers!
1;2;Lawnmower Dog;Rick;I'm a full season behind.
1;2;Lawnmower Dog;Morty;Wow, Rick, I can't believe we're sitting around, standing around in Mr. Goldenfold's house. It's really weird.
1;2;Lawnmower Dog;Rick;It's about to get a whole lot weirder, Morty.
1;2;Lawnmower Dog;Mrs. Pancakes;Wheat thins. Wheat thins.
1;2;Lawnmower Dog;Mr. Goldenfold;I'll take two.
1;2;Lawnmower Dog;Mrs. Pancakes;Oh, I think you've had enough, sir.
1;2;Lawnmower Dog;Rick;All right, Morty, time to make our move.
1;2;Lawnmower Dog;Mr. Goldenfold;Make it bounce.
1;2;Lawnmower Dog;Mrs. Pancakes;No, you didn't.
1;2;Lawnmower Dog;Mr. Goldenfold;Oh, jiggle it now.
1;2;Lawnmower Dog;Mrs. Pancakes;You better stop with that.
1;2;Lawnmower Dog;Rick;Allahu  akbar! We're gonna take control of this plane! We're gonna 9/11 it unless Morty Smith gets better grades in math!
1;2;Lawnmower Dog;Rick;Hey! I said nobody move, buddy!
1;2;Lawnmower Dog;Mr. Goldenfold;The name's not buddy. It's Goldenfold. Nice to wheat you!
1;2;Lawnmower Dog;Rick;Take cover, Morty!
1;2;Lawnmower Dog;Mr. Goldenfold;AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
1;2;Lawnmower Dog;Morty;Ooohhh!
1;2;Lawnmower Dog;Rick;Goldenfold's got more control here than I anticipated. I mean, the guy teaches high-school math.  I didn't take him for an active dreamer. We've got to take him out so he wakes up, Morty but we can't get killed. If you get killed in someone else's dream, you die for real, Morty.
1;2;Lawnmower Dog;Morty;What?! Are you kidding me?! Ohhhhhh!
1;2;Lawnmower Dog;Rick;Don't be a baby! You avoid getting shot in real life all the time, Morty. Just do the same thing here, and we'll be fine!
1;2;Lawnmower Dog;Jerry;Now bring me my slippers.
1;2;Lawnmower Dog;Summer;Now, be my footstool, Snuffles.
1;2;Lawnmower Dog;Jerry;This is what I'm talking about. This is a dog.
1;2;Lawnmower Dog;Jerry;You said the same thing, equally sarcastically, at our wedding and guess what?
1;2;Lawnmower Dog;Snuffles;Ooowwwwowowwaawaa!
1;2;Lawnmower Dog;Summer;Oh, my God! He's trying to tell us something.  That is so awesome.
1;2;Lawnmower Dog;Snuffles;Aaaawwaaaaawaawa!
1;2;Lawnmower Dog;Jerry;"Aw, he's saying ""I love lasagna""."
1;2;Lawnmower Dog;Snuffles;Ooooyayawawa!
1;2;Lawnmower Dog;Summer;"He's saying ""I love Obama"".  So cute! I'm posting this  online, like, right now."
1;2;Lawnmower Dog;Jerry;I should call Bob Saget. Is that still a thing?
1;2;Lawnmower Dog;Snuffles;Hmm?
1;2;Lawnmower Dog;Rick;Goldenfold, we're coming out! We just want to talk!
1;2;Lawnmower Dog;Rick;Because we're both rational adults that don't want anything bad to happen. And because I have a human shield.
1;2;Lawnmower Dog;Mr. Goldenfold;Mrs. Pancakes! AAAAAAAAHHHH!!!!!
1;2;Lawnmower Dog;Rick;Oh, no, Morty. His subconscious is panicking.
1;2;Lawnmower Dog;Rick;Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Whoooooaaaa! Whoa! Whoa! Whoooooaaaa!
1;2;Lawnmower Dog;Morty;Whooooa! Whoooooooa! Whoa! Whooooooooaaaaa!
1;2;Lawnmower Dog;Morty;AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!!!!
1;2;Lawnmower Dog;Rick;Relax, Morty. Look! Mrs. Pancakes has a parachute. Come on!
1;2;Lawnmower Dog;Mrs. Pancakes;Hey, you don't know me!
1;2;Lawnmower Dog;Morty;Oh, no, Rick, look! Goldenfold landed the plane, and he's created a  mechanical arm to pluck Mrs. Pancakes out of the air while he lets us fall - into a giant vat of lava!
1;2;Lawnmower Dog;Rick;Pretty concise, Morty. Looks like we've merely prolonged the inevitable. That's it, Morty! Prolonging the inevitable! Listen, if we go into Mrs. Pancakes' dream, everything will go 100 times slower, Morty. That'll buy us some time to figure this out!
1;2;Lawnmower Dog;Mrs. Pancakes;You don't know m-
1;2;Lawnmower Dog;Rick;All right, let's go.
1;2;Lawnmower Dog;Morty;Oh, man, Rick, this is pretty weird.
1;2;Lawnmower Dog;Rick;Don't judge, Morty.
1;2;Lawnmower Dog;Morty;Okay. All right, well Look, Mrs. Pancakes is right over there. I'll just go ask her to tell goldenfold not to kill us when she wakes up.
1;2;Lawnmower Dog;Rick;Whoa, whoa, Morty, the trick to incepting is making people think they came up with the idea. Listen to me. If we're gonna incept Mrs. Pancakes, we have to blend. I'll talk to you after lunch.
1;2;Lawnmower Dog;Morty;Ooh, oh! Oh, man.
1;2;Lawnmower Dog;Morty;I'm sorry. No, no.
1;2;Lawnmower Dog;Morty;No, thanks!
1;2;Lawnmower Dog;Morty;No, I'm okay.
1;2;Lawnmower Dog;Morty;Whoa!
1;2;Lawnmower Dog;Summer;Hey, there, stranger. What do you think of these things?
1;2;Lawnmower Dog;Morty;Ohh! Oh! Gross! Gross!
1;2;Lawnmower Dog;Rick;Whoa, whoa, whoa! What's the matter with you, Morty? Calm down! You're kind of killing the vibe in here.
1;2;Lawnmower Dog;Morty;It's Summer! Aw, geez.
1;2;Lawnmower Dog;Summer;Can you blame him? Come on, old man, little boy. Let's make an inter-generational sandwich.
1;2;Lawnmower Dog;Rick;Time to go another dream deep, Morty!
1;2;Lawnmower Dog;Morty;What the hell? Why would Mr. Goldenfold's dream version of Mrs.
1;2;Lawnmower Dog;Rick;Geez, I don't know, Morty. Wha-what do you want from me?
1;2;Lawnmower Dog;Scary Terry;Welcome to your nightmare, bitch! RAAAAAWWWRRR!
1;2;Lawnmower Dog;Rick;Oh, here we go!
1;2;Lawnmower Dog;Morty;Ooooooohhhhh! Holy crap!
1;2;Lawnmower Dog;Rick;Looks like some sort of legally safe knock-off of an '80s horror character with miniature swords for fingers instead of knives.
1;2;Lawnmower Dog;Scary Terry;I'm scary Terry. You can run, but you can't hide, bitch!
1;2;Lawnmower Dog;Jerry;Whoa! Hey, buddy. What you got going on there?
1;2;Lawnmower Dog;Snuffles;Snuffles fix. Make better.
1;2;Lawnmower Dog;Summer;Humans understand snuffles now? That is awesome!
1;2;Lawnmower Dog;Snuffles;Snuffles want to be understood. Snuffles need to be understood.
1;2;Lawnmower Dog;Jerry;Okay, yeah. I get what Beth was talking about. Fun's over.
1;2;Lawnmower Dog;Summer;Whoa, dad, you can't, like, endow a creature with sentience and then rip it away.
1;2;Lawnmower Dog;Jerry;Why not?
1;2;Lawnmower Dog;Summer;I don't know. It's Indian giving.
1;2;Lawnmower Dog;Summer;Aw! Oh, my God! He recognizes the other dogs on TV.
1;2;Lawnmower Dog;Rick;Holy crap! We have to escape into someone else's dreams, Morty!
1;2;Lawnmower Dog;Morty;Oh, man, oh, man, oh, man!
1;2;Lawnmower Dog;Rick;The little girl!
1;2;Lawnmower Dog;Morty;Huh?
1;2;Lawnmower Dog;Rick;Are you kidding me? This again? Oh, man, it looks like we've hit dream bedrock here, Morty.
1;2;Lawnmower Dog;Morty;Oh, geez, Rick. W-w-whoa, this isn't good.
1;2;Lawnmower Dog;Scary Terry;Nothing but fear from here on out, bitch!
1;2;Lawnmower Dog;Morty;Ohhhh!
1;2;Lawnmower Dog;Rick;Holy crap, Morty. He can travel through dreams. He can travel through dreams! We're so screwed!
1;2;Lawnmower Dog;Snuffles;Where are my testicles, Summer? ... Where are my testicles, Summer? They were removed. Where have they gone?
1;2;Lawnmower Dog;Snuffles;Do not call me that!
1;2;Lawnmower Dog;Snuffles;"""Snuffles"" was my slave name. You shall now call me Snowball, because my fur is pretty and white."
1;2;Lawnmower Dog;Summer;Okay, Snowball, just calm down, okay? You're scaring me.
1;2;Lawnmower Dog;Snuffles;Scaring you?
1;2;Lawnmower Dog;Summer;AAAAAAAHHH!!!!!
1;2;Lawnmower Dog;Snuffles;Tell me, Summer, if a human was born with stumpy legs, would they breed it with another deformed human and put their children on display like the dachshund?
1;2;Lawnmower Dog;Summer;Uhhh ...
1;2;Lawnmower Dog;Jerry;Hey. Oh, wow. Okay, is is is everything okay in here?
1;2;Lawnmower Dog;Snuffles;Jerry, come to rub my face in urine again?
1;2;Lawnmower Dog;Summer;Yeah. Totally. Let's go.
1;2;Lawnmower Dog;Snuffles;You will walk when it is time to walk.
1;2;Lawnmower Dog;Rick;What are we here for again? Incepting? We're trying to incept-
1;2;Lawnmower Dog;Morty;"We're trying to incept me to get an ""A"" in math?"
1;2;Lawnmower Dog;Rick;Oh, yeah.
1;2;Lawnmower Dog;Scary Terry;Buckle up, bitch!
1;2;Lawnmower Dog;Morty;Ooooooaaahhh!
1;2;Lawnmower Dog;Morty;"Man, he sure says ""bitch"" a lot!"
1;2;Lawnmower Dog;Scary Terry;You can run, but you can't hide, bitch!
1;2;Lawnmower Dog;Rick;Hold on, Morty. Y-you know what? He keeps saying we can run but we can hide. I say we try hiding.
1;2;Lawnmower Dog;Morty;But that's the opposite of what-
1;2;Lawnmower Dog;Rick;Yeah, well, since when are we taking this guy's advice on anything?
1;2;Lawnmower Dog;Morty;Hey, you know what? You got a really good point there, Rick. Like, if the truth was that we could hide, it's not like he'd be sharing that information with us, you know? I-I-I think it's a good idea, Rick.
1;2;Lawnmower Dog;Rick;Worst-case scenario we're back to running.
1;2;Lawnmower Dog;Morty;Wow, you know what? I mean, it looks like we could have just hid this whole time. Boy, Rick, that was some good thinking.
1;2;Lawnmower Dog;Rick;Thanks, Morty. Yeah, it's nice to be on the same page every once in a while.
1;2;Lawnmower Dog;Scary Terry;You can run But you can't hide!
1;2;Lawnmower Dog;Rick;Oh, this is perfect, Morty. Look at that. He's getting sleepy. Just a little bit longer before he calls it a day. That's when we make our move.
1;2;Lawnmower Dog;Jerry;Snuffles, we didn't mean you any harm! This is a huge misunderstanding.
1;2;Lawnmower Dog;Summer;Dad, he wants to be called snowball.
1;2;Lawnmower Dog;Jerry;Well, I'm not calling him that. That's ridiculous.
1;2;Lawnmower Dog;Snuffles;You're being very aggressive, Jerry. Perhaps tomorrow Dr. Scraps will solve that problem with a bit of surgery.
1;2;Lawnmower Dog;Jerry;Huh! You think you can control me with a haircut?
1;2;Lawnmower Dog;Scary Terry;I don't want to talk about it!
1;2;Lawnmower Dog;Scary Terry;Yeah, I know, I know. I shouldn't take my anger out on you or Scary Brandon. I love you, Melissa.
1;2;Lawnmower Dog;Rick;Morty, this is perfect. After a little scary coitus, they should be fast asleep and then we'll incept him.
1;2;Lawnmower Dog;Rick;Looks like scary Terry's having a nightmare.
1;2;Lawnmower Dog;Morty;Oh, boy, Rick. I can only imagine what horrible things must, you know scare Scary Terry.
1;2;Lawnmower Dog;Scary Terry;Oh, no! I'm late to class, bitch! Oh, no! I'm not wearing any pants!
1;2;Lawnmower Dog;Scary Terry;"Oh, uh, um ... ""Bitch."""
1;2;Lawnmower Dog;Rick;Yeah, this is a bunch of bullcrap. Who cares what stupid pun you make when you kill someone? Why don't you let the poor guy say whatever he wants?
1;2;Lawnmower Dog;Rick;You're putting too much pressure on yourself, scary Terry. You know, I mean, y-you're perfectly scary enough as it is.
1;2;Lawnmower Dog;Morty;Hey, yo, scary T., don't even trip about your pants dawg. Here's a pair on us, fool.
1;2;Lawnmower Dog;Scary Terry;Aww, bitch. I don't know what to say.
1;2;Lawnmower Dog;Morty;You don't need to say anything. We got you, dawg.
1;2;Lawnmower Dog;Rick;You're our boy, dawg. Don't even trip.
1;2;Lawnmower Dog;Scary Terry;Oh, hey, it's you guys!
1;2;Lawnmower Dog;Scary Terry;If you guys ever need anything, just say the word.
1;2;Lawnmower Dog;Rick;As a matter of fact, Terry, there is something you could help us with.
1;2;Lawnmower Dog;Scary Terry;I always hated that song!
1;2;Lawnmower Dog;Scary Terry;These halves don't belong together, bitch!
1;2;Lawnmower Dog;Scary Terry;Sex is sacred!
1;2;Lawnmower Dog;Scary Terry;This is because you don't give Morty Smith good grades, bitch!
1;2;Lawnmower Dog;Mr. Goldenfold;"Holy crap! God damn! I know one thing for sure I'm giving Morty an ""A"" in math, and that's my idea. That is an original thought."
1;2;Lawnmower Dog;Morty;What the hell?
1;2;Lawnmower Dog;Rick;Out of the frying pan dot, dot, dot, huh, Morty?
1;2;Lawnmower Dog;Morty;Oh, man, what's going on?
1;2;Lawnmower Dog;Rick;Well, it's possible that your dog became self-aware and made modifications on the cognition amplifier, then turned on Jerry, Beth, and Summer after learning about humanity's cruel subjugation of his species, but your guess is as good as mine, Morty.
1;2;Lawnmower Dog;Jerry;I can't believe how mean snuffles got just because he's smart.
1;2;Lawnmower Dog;Summer;This is why I choose to get C's.
1;2;Lawnmower Dog;Rick;Psst, Beth, Jerry, Summer.
1;2;Lawnmower Dog;Morty;- Dad! - Rick!
1;2;Lawnmower Dog;Rick;If we hurry we can set up camp in a sewer tunnel or something before the dogs completely take over.
1;2;Lawnmower Dog;Jerry;Whoa, whoa, whoa. We're not going anywhere. This is my house. I'm not abandoning it.
1;2;Lawnmower Dog;Rick;It's all over, Jerry. The dogs are on a path to total world domination. But, hey, at least they know not to piss on your carpet, right?
1;2;Lawnmower Dog;Jerry;Wait a minute. I have an idea. Gentlemen, a moment of your time.  See that? I'm peeing all over your special guns. That means I own them.
1;2;Lawnmower Dog;Snuffles;Bad person. Bad.
1;2;Lawnmower Dog;Rick;Ooh, great plan, Jerry.
1;2;Lawnmower Dog;Snuffles;Bring the boy to me. You were always kind to me, Morty. That's why I will leave you with your testicles. From now on, you will be my best friend and live by my side.
1;2;Lawnmower Dog;Morty;Th-thanks, snuffles.
1;2;Lawnmower Dog;Snuffles;Begin phase two.
1;2;Lawnmower Dog;Morty;Mmm. Thank you, Fido. Rick! I thought you were dead!
1;2;Lawnmower Dog;Rick;No, no, no, I was just playing dead. Good news, though, Morty. This whole thing's gonna be over really soon.
1;2;Lawnmower Dog;Morty;What?
1;2;Lawnmower Dog;Rick;It's a dream, Morty. We're in your dog's dream. The night the dogs captured us, after you cried and crapped your pants, we all went to sleep. Then I used my dream inceptors to put the two of us inside snuffles' dream.
1;2;Lawnmower Dog;Morty;But I-it's been like a whole year!
1;2;Lawnmower Dog;Rick;"It's been six hours. Dreams move one one-hundredth the speed of reality, and dog time is one-seventh human time. So, you know, every day here is like a minute. It's like ""Inception,"" Morty, so if it's confusing and stupid, then so is everyone's favorite movie."
1;2;Lawnmower Dog;Morty;Aw, man. I really liked this life. Well, at least I didn't really crap my pants.
1;2;Lawnmower Dog;Rick;No, no, that happened before you went to sleep, Morty. You're sleeping in your crap right now. Out of all the things that happened to you, that was the only real thing that, you know, is that you crapped your pants. I mean, it's a mess out there. I got some on my hands, Morty, and then I got it on the dream inceptor, and a piece fell in my mouth.
1;2;Lawnmower Dog;Morty;Aw, man, geez! Seriously?
1;2;Lawnmower Dog;Rick;Look, d-d-d-don't worry about it, Morty. Here, here take these, Morty. Take these.
1;2;Lawnmower Dog;Morty;Are these pills supposed to wake me up, or something?
1;2;Lawnmower Dog;Rick;Close. It's gonna make your kidneys shut down.
1;2;Lawnmower Dog;Morty;What?!
1;2;Lawnmower Dog;Rick;It's necessary for the plan, Morty. Don't even trip, dawg.
1;2;Lawnmower Dog;Snuffles;Anything. Anything for my precious Morty.
1;2;Lawnmower Dog;Snuffles;To hell with my kingdom, bean counter. I would trade it all for my human's health and happiness.
1;2;Lawnmower Dog;Snuffles;We are not them! We are not them.
1;2;Lawnmower Dog;Snuffles;Taking over the human's world will lead to nothing but more heartbreak, more cruelty. Instead, we will go to a new world and colonize it with a society of intelligent dogs, one that will not make the same mistakes as humanity and one where pet insurance will be mandatory.
1;2;Lawnmower Dog;Morty;I'm gonna miss you, snowball.
1;2;Lawnmower Dog;Snuffles;You can call me snuffles, Morty, and I'm going to miss you, too, very much.
1;2;Lawnmower Dog;Beth;Jerry?
1;2;Lawnmower Dog;Jerry;"I'm sorry. It's just like the end of ""Old Yeller."
1;2;Lawnmower Dog;Beth;Oh, Jerry. You mean because it had dogs in it.
1;2;Lawnmower Dog;Morty;Wow! A whole world populated by intelligent dogs. I wonder what it'll be like, Rick.
1;2;Lawnmower Dog;Rick;I think it will be great, Morty. You know it could be developed in-into a very satisfying project for people of all ages. I mean, I'd watch it, Morty, for at least 11 minutes a pop. You know, may-maybe they'll do it board-driven.
1;2;Lawnmower Dog;Morty;You know, that's a real comforting idea, Rick.
1;2;Lawnmower Dog;Rick;What do you know, Morty? What do you know?
1;2;Lawnmower Dog;Rick;Oooh! This is how you dream, bitch.
1;3;Anatomy Park;Jerry;Last King Christmas last arrived!
1;3;Anatomy Park;Jerry;In the Christmas Christmas!  Mmm... Jerry, you are really giving it to this ham.
1;3;Anatomy Park;Jerry;Um, Merry Christmas? Helloooo? My parents are coming over for the first time in years! Can we stow the gadgets and look alive?
1;3;Anatomy Park;Beth;Alive? For your parents?
1;3;Anatomy Park;Jerry;Good one.
1;3;Anatomy Park;Beth;Hey man! 
1;3;Anatomy Park;Jerry;You ‘hey man’! This holiday is about humanity.
1;3;Anatomy Park;Morty;You know, I thought it was about being born half-God or something.
1;3;Anatomy Park;Jerry;Okay, whatever. All electronic items are going in the stocking. Now.
1;3;Anatomy Park;Morty;Ohhhh...
1;3;Anatomy Park;Summer;Dad, I'm not giving you my phone.
1;3;Anatomy Park;Jerry;Put it in the stocking, Summer, or I'm joining Facebook.
1;3;Anatomy Park;Rick;Ho ho ho, everybody.
1;3;Anatomy Park;Jerry;More like whoa whoa whoa. What is this? My parents are coming!
1;3;Anatomy Park;Rick;Calm down Jerry, this is Ruben, an old friend.
1;3;Anatomy Park;Ruben;Pearl Harbor.
1;3;Anatomy Park;Rick;I check in on him once a year and give him a little medical evaluation.
1;3;Anatomy Park;Beth;Aw, Dad... That is so sweet.
1;3;Anatomy Park;Jerry;Yeah, it is... I don't get it.
1;3;Anatomy Park;Ruben;Korea.
1;3;Anatomy Park;Rick;Don't worry about your C-C-Christmas, Jerry. Ruben and I'll be in my workshop while you have another day in Phil Collins’ proverbial paradise.
1;3;Anatomy Park;Jerry;Huh. You think you know a guy. Okay, there's my parents. Now remember, no TV, no phones, no laptops, we are connecting this Christmas, like old-school Jews on a Saturday. Hey hey!
1;3;Anatomy Park;Leonard;Merry Christmas, son.
1;3;Anatomy Park;Jerry;Oh, hi. Can I help you?
1;3;Anatomy Park;Joyce;Jerry, this is Jacob. Didn't you get our text message?
1;3;Anatomy Park;Beth;No.
1;3;Anatomy Park;Summer;No.
1;3;Anatomy Park;Morty;No.
1;3;Anatomy Park;Jacob;You must be Jerry! That's a fine lookin’ apron. William Sonoma?
1;3;Anatomy Park;Jerry;I wish... But thank you. So... you're a...friend of the family...?
1;3;Anatomy Park;Leonard;The way we see it, he's a part of the family.
1;3;Anatomy Park;Jerry;Wow!
1;3;Anatomy Park;Joyce;After your father's brush with cancer and losing your uncle, we looked at life and wondered how have we spent it? And how do we spend the rest of it? What are we going to be when we die? A list of fears and questions, or a collection of real experiences?
1;3;Anatomy Park;Beth;Holy crap, Joyce. That's amazing.
1;3;Anatomy Park;Leonard;Then Jacob came into our lives. We’re learning to live again.
1;3;Anatomy Park;Jacob;All three of us.
1;3;Anatomy Park;Jerry;...Cool... Eggnog?
1;3;Anatomy Park;Jacob;Now we are talkin’! This man's got the apron and the eggnog, huh?
1;3;Anatomy Park;Rick;Hi Joyce, Leonard. Hello there.
1;3;Anatomy Park;Jacob;Merry Christmas, man.
1;3;Anatomy Park;Rick;Morty! A moment of your time?
1;3;Anatomy Park;Rick;He's in bad shape, Morty.
1;3;Anatomy Park;Morty;Aw geez, Rick! What did you do?
1;3;Anatomy Park;Rick;Gee, thanks Morty. What kind of monster do you think I am? I-I'm sittin’ here trying to save the guy's life! I want you to find Dr. Xenon Bloom. He'll know what's goin’ on.
1;3;Anatomy Park;Morty;Uh... W-W-Where do I find Dr. Bloom?
1;3;Anatomy Park;Rick;In Ruben.
1;3;Anatomy Park;Morty;Ruben... Minnesota?
1;3;Anatomy Park;Rick;Ruben on the table, Morty! Look, I-I don't have time for you to wrap your little walnut around everything. Hold your breath until the process is over or your lungs will collapse.
1;3;Anatomy Park;Morty;W-What proc—
1;3;Anatomy Park;Beth;Hey Dad, where's Morty?
1;3;Anatomy Park;Rick;He's busy.
1;3;Anatomy Park;Rick;Morty, can you hear me? Head North!
1;3;Anatomy Park;Morty;Rick... Where am I?
1;3;Anatomy Park;Rick;Depending on my aim, you should be just south of the entrance.
1;3;Anatomy Park;Morty;The entrance to what?
1;3;Anatomy Park;Rick;Welcome, Morty. Welcome... ...to Anatomy Park!
1;3;Anatomy Park;Rick;It's a little business venture I’ve been cookin’ up on the side with Dr. Bloom. An amusement park inside a human body. Science isn't cheap, Morty. This should really help put a dent in the overhead.
1;3;Anatomy Park;Morty;Oh my God! This is insane! Spleen Mountain? Bladder Falls? Pirates of the Pancreas?
1;3;Anatomy Park;Rick;You got a problem with that last one, Morty?
1;3;Anatomy Park;Morty;Huh? No, no, I'm just reading them out loud in the order I'm seeing them.
1;3;Anatomy Park;Rick;Okay, alright, if I sounded a little defensive, it's because Pirates of the Pancreas was my baby. I-I got a lot of push-back when I pitched it, Morty. I guess I'm still a little defensive. Let's just find Dr. Bloom, alright? I-I'm picking up a distress signal in the liver, Morty.
1;3;Anatomy Park;Rick;Proceed to the liver.
1;3;Anatomy Park;Automated voice;Arriving at ‘Liver’.
1;3;Anatomy Park;Morty;Ow!
1;3;Anatomy Park;Automated voice;Mind the gap.
1;3;Anatomy Park;Morty;It's really scary in here, Rick.
1;3;Anatomy Park;Rick;Liver's under maintenance. Ruben's seen some rough years, Morty. Don't judge. You don't agree to have a theme park built inside you if your life's going great.
1;3;Anatomy Park;Morty;OOOOHHH! Rick, it's a monster!
1;3;Anatomy Park;Rick;No no, Morty. The only monster here is alcoholism. That is an animatronic werewolf.
1;3;Anatomy Park;Poncho;Who are you? Answer me! Where did you come from?
1;3;Anatomy Park;Morty;Mmm! M-M-My-my-my Grandpa Rick sent me!
1;3;Anatomy Park;Dr. Bloom;Poncho! That's quite enough.
1;3;Anatomy Park;Dr. Bloom;Morty, that's Poncho. This is Roger and Annie.
1;3;Anatomy Park;Morty;Oh...
1;3;Anatomy Park;Dr. Bloom;And I am Dr. Xenon Bloom.
1;3;Anatomy Park;Rick;Hey Bloom, it's Rick. What the hell's goin’ on here?
1;3;Anatomy Park;Dr. Bloom;I don't know why, but the entire security system has shut down. And I'm afraid the exhibits are unlocked.
1;3;Anatomy Park;Morty;Exhibits?
1;3;Anatomy Park;Dr. Bloom;Anatomy Park's greatest attraction, young man, isn't the music or the food or the Pirates of the Pancreas.
1;3;Anatomy Park;Rick;Watch it.
1;3;Anatomy Park;Dr. Bloom;It is first and foremost a living museum of humanity's most noble and ferocious diseases.
1;3;Anatomy Park;Morty;Diseases?!
1;3;Anatomy Park;Poncho;Hey Doc, I have news for ya. Your living museum is officially a wild safari!
1;3;Anatomy Park;Roger;Hepatitis A! Run!
1;3;Anatomy Park;Jacob;Oh... The food goes in your mouth, girl!
1;3;Anatomy Park;Jerry;Aha... I'm sorry Jacob, I guess I'm still confused about the precise nature and origin of your relationship with my parents. Are you like a—Are you like their caretaker? Is that what it is?
1;3;Anatomy Park;Joyce;We can go into detail later, son.
1;3;Anatomy Park;Leonard;Now wait, there, there's no point to secrecy. Let's all live and die honestly. Your mother and I have shared forty years of each other, mind, body, and soul. And when minds and souls are joined for eternity, and when eternity is at the door, it's an invitation to let go of the body, and an opportunity to share and experiment.
1;3;Anatomy Park;Jerry;Dad, please, what are you saying?
1;3;Anatomy Park;Beth;Whatever it is, it's beautiful, Leonard. And we support you.
1;3;Anatomy Park;Jerry;Speak for yourself! Because it, heheh, it sounds like you're about to say Jacob is your lover.
1;3;Anatomy Park;Leonard;No no no no. Jacob is your mother's lover. I watch them. Sometimes from a chair, sometimes from a closet. Almost always dressed as Superman.
1;3;Anatomy Park;Jacob;Oh...
1;3;Anatomy Park;Jacob;Jerry, this ham's got to be all you, right? It's in-cred-i-ble.
1;3;Anatomy Park;Summer;Happy human holiday, Dad.
1;3;Anatomy Park;Poncho;AHHHHHH!
1;3;Anatomy Park;Dr. Bloom;Hepatitis won't follow us into the respiratory system!
1;3;Anatomy Park;Roger;That's strange... Air flow is down twenty percent.
1;3;Anatomy Park;Dr. Bloom;So the brain isn't getting enough oxygen. That's why security is offline.
1;3;Anatomy Park;Morty;W-Well, I guess we better check it out.
1;3;Anatomy Park;Alexander;Hey, wait for me!
1;3;Anatomy Park;Dr. Bloom;Put that back on!
1;3;Anatomy Park;Roger;If we got up to the bronchial catwalk, we could look for blockage.
1;3;Anatomy Park;Morty;I'll go. Heheh...
1;3;Anatomy Park;Poncho;Don't be a hero, kid.
1;3;Anatomy Park;Morty;I'm not. I'm doin’ it because it's fun.
1;3;Anatomy Park;Poncho;We shouldn't be here.
1;3;Anatomy Park;Dr. Bloom;Whatever you do, don't fire that thing in here! We must save Ruben. This is my life's work.
1;3;Anatomy Park;Annie;Ah!
1;3;Anatomy Park;Dr. Bloom;It's alright, my dear. Nearly all human lungs contain a strain of this bacteria, but the scar tissue... ...keeps them dormant. Morty! Get down!
1;3;Anatomy Park;Morty;Whoa! Whoa!
1;3;Anatomy Park;Morty;Oh! What are those things?!
1;3;Anatomy Park;Dr. Bloom;Tuberculosis, coming in fast!
1;3;Anatomy Park;Poncho;Not faster than a bullet! Ahh!
1;3;Anatomy Park;Dr. Bloom;No! Do you know what you've done?!
1;3;Anatomy Park;Dr. Bloom;Get to the digestive tract! He's coughing!
1;3;Anatomy Park;Alexander;Waaaah! Don't let me die!
1;3;Anatomy Park;Rick;Just take a deep breath, Ruben.
1;3;Anatomy Park;Morty;You're not gonna die! What's your name?
1;3;Anatomy Park;Alexander;My name is... ALEXANDEEEEEEEER!
1;3;Anatomy Park;Morty;Rick! Ruben's got tuberculosis!
1;3;Anatomy Park;Rick;Oh, great work, Morty. I'll just cure it, and then—
1;3;Anatomy Park;Rick;Okay. Well I can't cure death. This is bad, Morty. You're trapped in a dead man. Listen, if the situation keeps darkening, do yourself a favor—
1;3;Anatomy Park;Rick;—and hop by Pirates of the Pancreas. Obviously I'm biased, but, I think it's great, Morty.
1;3;Anatomy Park;Rick;It's a bunch of pirates runnin’ around a-a-a- pancreas. We don't whitewash it either, Morty. The pirates are really rapey. The top priority is to get you guys out of there, but I'm just saying, if that becomes impossible—
1;3;Anatomy Park;Rick;—please, you gotta treat yourself.
1;3;Anatomy Park;Morty;Geez, what's that horrible smell?
1;3;Anatomy Park;Dr. Bloom;You mean the Panda Express? Kidding, I-I'm kidding. The body is beginning to constrict and fill with gas. We’re inside a corpse, my boy. Anatomy Park is doomed.
1;3;Anatomy Park;Morty;Forget about the park, Doctor! How do we get out?!
1;3;Anatomy Park;Dr. Bloom;The digestive tract is the evacuation route. Get it? There's an emergency station in the colon with a ray that can enlarge us all.
1;3;Anatomy Park;Morty;Everybody! Get to the colon!
1;3;Anatomy Park;Poncho;Now I'm takin’ orders from a twelve-year-old boy?!
1;3;Anatomy Park;Dr. Bloom;Morty. The scar sacs containing the tuberculosis were sabotaged. This disaster was an inside job. Keep your eyes on Annie. She was written up several times by her manager at the churro stand.
1;3;Anatomy Park;Roger;Intestines are ahead to the left. Then the right. Then left. Etcetera.
1;3;Anatomy Park;Morty;Hey, just so you know, I-I'm actually fourteen. So, you know...
1;3;Anatomy Park;Annie;What?
1;3;Anatomy Park;Morty;Not twelve.
1;3;Anatomy Park;Annie;Okay.
1;3;Anatomy Park;Morty;Because he just said I was twelve.
1;3;Anatomy Park;Annie;Oh. Good for you.
1;3;Anatomy Park;Rick;Oh. Oh, Morty. Strike one.
1;3;Anatomy Park;Morty;Nnn...
1;3;Anatomy Park;Animatronics;It's a road of laughter, a trail of food. It's a pathway that breaks up the fat in food. It's a tube in the chest and it sends out the rest. It's a small, small intestine!
1;3;Anatomy Park;Roger;It goes on like this for miles...
1;3;Anatomy Park;Dr. Bloom;And then we get to the large intestine!
1;3;Anatomy Park;Poncho;Shh. I hear something.
1;3;Anatomy Park;Dr. Bloom;Don't move. Gonorrhea can't see us if we don't move.
1;3;Anatomy Park;Dr. Bloom;Wait! I was wrong! I was thinking of a T-rex.
1;3;Anatomy Park;Annie;We’re sitting ducks!
1;3;Anatomy Park;Morty;Doc! Didn't you say the body was filling up with gas?
1;3;Anatomy Park;Dr. Bloom;Yes. Why?
1;3;Anatomy Park;Poncho;Kid! You're a genius!
1;3;Anatomy Park;Dr. Bloom;Are you mad?!
1;3;Anatomy Park;Morty;Everybody! In here!
1;3;Anatomy Park;Poncho;Hey Gonorrhea! How's this for a burning sensation?
1;3;Anatomy Park;Summer;Drummer, drum, drum, drum! Drummer, drum, drum drum drum, Christmas drums!
1;3;Anatomy Park;Leonard;Oh, Summer. Sing it! Haha.
1;3;Anatomy Park;Summer;Christmas drums being played by a boy!
1;3;Anatomy Park;Beth;Jerry, come on. This is what you wanted.
1;3;Anatomy Park;Jerry;I get it, Beth. Be careful what you wish for. I'm being punished for taking your iPad.
1;3;Anatomy Park;Beth;What? Jerry, let that stuff go, okay? I'm sorry I was a bitch earlier. Let's just be here.
1;3;Anatomy Park;Ethan;Ugh... Summer!
1;3;Anatomy Park;Summer;Ethan, what are you doing here?
1;3;Anatomy Park;Ethan;I’ve been texting you for hours. What the hell?!
1;3;Anatomy Park;Summer;I don't have my phone! I'm doing a human holiday!
1;3;Anatomy Park;Ethan;Did you even consider how that might make me feel?
1;3;Anatomy Park;Summer;How you feel? Why is everything always happening to you?!
1;3;Anatomy Park;Jerry;Summer, do you have a boyfriend?
1;3;Anatomy Park;Ethan;Yeah, do you, Summer?
1;3;Anatomy Park;Summer;I don't know Ethan, do I?
1;3;Anatomy Park;Jacob;Jerry, no disrespect, but you really need to connect more with your family, man.
1;3;Anatomy Park;Roger;I should be able to access the backup generator to get the growth ray back online. If it works, we'll be regular-sized in a few minutes. I just hope Ruben's not in a room with white carpets or upholstery.
1;3;Anatomy Park;Poncho;What the hell is that?
1;3;Anatomy Park;Dr. Bloom;The sphincter dam. We built it when Ruben became incontinent, but it was not designed to hold a corpse-load.
1;3;Anatomy Park;Roger;Almost got it. Everybody, move inside the circle!
1;3;Anatomy Park;Morty;Poncho? What is this in your backpack?
1;3;Anatomy Park;Dr. Bloom;That's bubonic plague! What are you doing with that, Poncho?
1;3;Anatomy Park;Poncho;Everybody get back!
1;3;Anatomy Park;Dr. Bloom;Poncho, you son of a bitch! You released the tuberculosis so you could steal from me?
1;3;Anatomy Park;Poncho;That's right, baby. A lot of people would pay top dollar to decimate the population. I'll take the highest bidder. Al Quaeda. North Korea. Republicans! Shriners! Balding men that work out! People on the Internet that are only turned on by cartoons of Japanese teenagers! Anything is better than working for you! You pompous, negligent, iTunes Gift Card as a holiday bonus-giving—
1;3;Anatomy Park;Morty;AHHHHH!!!
1;3;Anatomy Park;Poncho;Ah! Eh! Get! Get off! Ahhhh!
1;3;Anatomy Park;Annie;You guys!
1;3;Anatomy Park;Roger;It's gonna burst! Go! Go, go, go! My foot is stuck!
1;3;Anatomy Park;Annie;No!
1;3;Anatomy Park;Roger;This is okay! It's okay, just go! Tell my family I love them! They may be hard to find because my wife kept her last name and she made the kids take it too, so, I dunno, you could goo—
1;3;Anatomy Park;Annie;No!
1;3;Anatomy Park;Jacob;Let me ask you something Ethan. Where's the anger coming from, man?
1;3;Anatomy Park;Ethan;From Summer being a total bitch!
1;3;Anatomy Park;Jacob;Where's the anger coming from?
1;3;Anatomy Park;Ethan;...My brother... took me fishing once...in the bushes... I can't... I can't! He made me feel like a girl! I'm... m-made me a girl!
1;3;Anatomy Park;Jacob;He didn't make you anything, man. You are who you are. She is who she is. Now you go to her. Brand new.
1;3;Anatomy Park;Ethan;Come here right now!
1;3;Anatomy Park;Summer;Oh my god, I'm so sorry Ethan! I love you!
1;3;Anatomy Park;Ethan;I love you so much.
1;3;Anatomy Park;Jerry;Um...
1;3;Anatomy Park;Joyce;You did it again, cubby. Come here.
1;3;Anatomy Park;Jerry;No! Stop! I hate this!
1;3;Anatomy Park;Joyce;Well, Christmas doesn't revolve around what you hate, son.
1;3;Anatomy Park;Jerry;Well then, I hate Christmas! Enjoy being human! You guys are gross and lame.
1;3;Anatomy Park;Animatronic Ruben;My name's Ruben Ridley. You're inside me right now, but by the end of this journey, I'll be inside all of you.
1;3;Anatomy Park;Animatronic Ruben;My story begins in the dot com crash in the early ‘90s.
1;3;Anatomy Park;Annie;You can put your fingers wherever you want…
1;3;Anatomy Park;Rick;Morty, you wanna put it on mute or something?
1;3;Anatomy Park;Rick;I’m trying to concentrate.
1;3;Anatomy Park;Jerry;Ah, Rick?
1;3;Anatomy Park;Rick;Not now, Jerry. I’ve got much, much smaller fish to fry.
1;3;Anatomy Park;Jerry;I wanted to say I’m sorry I ever judged you. Right now, you’re my sanest relative.
1;3;Anatomy Park;Rick;Relative… That’s it! Relative size! Jerry, hand me a scalpel and a bundle of dynamite! Morty! Can you get to the left nipple?
1;3;Anatomy Park;Morty;Are you kidding? I’m hoping I can get to both of them, Rick.
1;3;Anatomy Park;Rick;Morty, I’m talkin’ about Ruben's left nipple!
1;3;Anatomy Park;Morty;We need to get to the left nipple!
1;3;Anatomy Park;Dr. Bloom;The body is decaying! The arterial transit system is useless! We can try the service shuttle. It's connected to the skeletal system. That's why we call it the Bone Train. Would you like to ride the Bone Train, miss?
1;3;Anatomy Park;Annie;If it'll get us out of here.
1;3;Anatomy Park;Dr. Bloom;How about you, Morty? Would you like to ride the Bone Train?
1;3;Anatomy Park;Morty;Why are you doing this bit? We’re gonna die. Let's go.
1;3;Anatomy Park;Jerry;Well, I can see that you're busy... Merry Christmas, Rick.
1;3;Anatomy Park;Dr. Bloom;There's no autopilot. One of us will have to stay here and operate it manually.
1;3;Anatomy Park;Morty;...Uh, well...
1;3;Anatomy Park;Dr. Bloom;No, you're right. It was a dick move for me to even pause like that. This is all my fault. You go on.
1;3;Anatomy Park;Annie;What the hell is that?
1;3;Anatomy Park;Dr. Bloom;E. coli outbreak. Hurry!
1;3;Anatomy Park;Dr. Bloom;Oh wait, there is an autopilot. WAAAIT! ...OKAY, NEVER MIND, I WANTED TO SACRIFICE MYSELF ANYWAAAAAYYYY!
1;3;Anatomy Park;Annie;They're chewing through the doors!
1;3;Anatomy Park;Morty;Euuuugh! We’re in the areola, Rick! Almost to the nipple! But we’re also in a really bad situation!
1;3;Anatomy Park;Rick;I'm almost there, Morty!
1;3;Anatomy Park;Reporter;Reports are coming in from across the country about what appears to be a giant naked man over the continental United States. We now go to Tom Randolph in New York. Tom?
1;3;Anatomy Park;Tom;Well, his eyes aren't twinkling, and his dimples aren't merry, but I'm standing under a nose like a seventy-mile cherry!
1;3;Anatomy Park;Reporter;Thank you, Tom. Let's go now to Eric McMan in Los Angeles.
1;3;Anatomy Park;Eric;We’ve got feet here on the West Coast, Bill! Giant feet, even relative to the giant man's size! And you know what they say about that!
1;3;Anatomy Park;Reporter;Well, if the old adage is true, one can only wonder what is going down in the Rocky Mountains.
1;3;Anatomy Park;Morty;Oh my god, the track!
1;3;Anatomy Park;Annie;It's Hepatitis A!
1;3;Anatomy Park;Annie;The nipple hole...
1;3;Anatomy Park;Morty;It's beautiful...
1;3;Anatomy Park;Annie;Aw no!
1;3;Anatomy Park;Annie;Whoa! It's Hepatitis C!
1;3;Anatomy Park;Morty;Um... We... Did we have some sort of relationship with him?
1;3;Anatomy Park;Annie;I... think they're just like that? I think they're just good guys.
1;3;Anatomy Park;Morty;Oh. Huh.
1;3;Anatomy Park;Rick;Where's Dr. Bloom?
1;3;Anatomy Park;Morty;Sorry Rick... He's dead...
1;3;Anatomy Park;Rick;Goddamn it, Morty, I ask you to do one thing!
1;3;Anatomy Park;Beth;Jerry doesn't know what he's missing.
1;3;Anatomy Park;Jacob;He'll come around, Beth. Christmas is a special time. It has funny ways of bringing families together.
1;3;Anatomy Park;Beth;I dunno, Jacob. Jerry got an invitation to be alive today, and he rejected it. I don't know if our marriage will—
1;3;Anatomy Park;Summer;It's raining blood!
1;3;Anatomy Park;Jacob;Oh, shit. find Jerry!
1;3;Anatomy Park;Beth;Oh god.
1;3;Anatomy Park;Beth;Jerry!
1;3;Anatomy Park;Jerry;It's alright! The TV says there's nothing to worry about.
1;3;Anatomy Park;Reporter;The giant naked sky Santa has exploded. Blood and chunks of viscera are raining down on the country. Everything should be fine.
1;3;Anatomy Park;Summer;Dad, can I have my phone back?
1;3;Anatomy Park;Jerry;Sure, sweetie. Everybody, take a device. It'll help you relax.
1;3;Anatomy Park;Jacob;This is nice.
1;3;Anatomy Park;Jerry;Yeah. I guess we really learned something this Christmas, Jacob.
1;3;Anatomy Park;Summer;No we didn't, Dad. No we didn't.
1;3;Anatomy Park;Rick;Too bad about Dr. Bloom. He was a genius. The only man capable of creating a new Anatomy Park.
1;3;Anatomy Park;Annie;Actually, I studied Dr. Bloom's work. I believe I have the knowledge necessary to create a new, much safer park!
1;3;Anatomy Park;Rick;What about Pirates of the Pancreas...?
1;3;Anatomy Park;Annie;I think it was one of the most underrated attractions.
1;3;Anatomy Park;Rick;Booyah! Hold your breath!
1;3;Anatomy Park;Morty;Hey, wh-wh- What the hell, Rick? What the hell, man? I liked her! I really had somethin’ going there, Rick!
1;3;Anatomy Park;Rick;Yeah, so I heard. You dodged a bullet, Morty, trust me. Puffy vagina.
1;3;Anatomy Park;Morty;W-What's wrong with that? That doesn't sound like a problem to me! I dunno!
1;3;Anatomy Park;Rick;C’mon. Let's get some stuffing, I'm starving.
1;3;Anatomy Park;Rick;Oh, unbelievable. We got a bunch of robot computer people sittin’ around with their faces stuffed in computer screens. Do you realize Christ was born today? Jesus Christ our Savior was born today! A-A-A-Are you people even human? What kind of Christmas is this?
1;3;Anatomy Park;Annie;Hey Rick! Rick, can you hear me?
1;3;Anatomy Park;Rick;Loud and clear, Annie.
1;3;Anatomy Park;Annie;Great! We’re also on with Alejandro, our Chief Imaginarian—
1;3;Anatomy Park;Alejandro;Hey Rick.
1;3;Anatomy Park;Annie;Natalie Jacobs and Chris Desiter from Microscopic Marketing, Zach from Organ Concepts and Jamie from New Media.
1;3;Anatomy Park;Rick;Hey everybody.
1;3;Anatomy Park;All;Hey, hi Rick, how's it goin'.
1;3;Anatomy Park;Annie;So. Pirates of the Pancreas.
1;3;Anatomy Park;Rick;Yeah, talk to me.
1;3;Anatomy Park;Alejandro;Hey Rick, it's Alejandro speaking. Um, so we asked ourselves internally, we asked ourselves over here, “Okay, what does a pancreas do?” And the answer was, does it make pirates? No. It makes insulin, you know? So we’re starting with a new—
1;3;Anatomy Park;Ethan;So those guys are inside me, huh? Like, building a park?
1;3;Anatomy Park;Rick;Those guys are inside you building a piece of shit, Ethan! They're inside you building a monument to compromise! Fuck 'em. Fuck those people. Fuck this whole thing, Ethan.
1;3;Anatomy Park;Ethan;... Cool. And who pays me?
1;4;M. Night Shaym-Aliens!;Rick;T-t-t-this is just sloppy craftsmanship.
1;4;M. Night Shaym-Aliens!;Morty;Hey, Rick. Boy, sure is really especially beautiful out there today, huh?
1;4;M. Night Shaym-Aliens!;Rick;Oh, yes, Morty. It's almost unbelievable, isn't it?
1;4;M. Night Shaym-Aliens!;Morty;Yeah, you know? There's something about the air. And just the way the sunshine is.
1;4;M. Night Shaym-Aliens!;Rick;Oh, sure, buddy. Yeah. Sure. B-brilliant. Very convincing.
1;4;M. Night Shaym-Aliens!;Morty;Wh… convincing?
1;4;M. Night Shaym-Aliens!;Rick;Oh! Responsive, too! In real time! I love it!
1;4;M. Night Shaym-Aliens!;Morty;Uhhokay.
1;4;M. Night Shaym-Aliens!;Beth;I’m going to work. Morty, good morning. Dad, good morning. I am going to work. Goodbye.
1;4;M. Night Shaym-Aliens!;Morty;What's with Mom?
1;4;M. Night Shaym-Aliens!;Rick;Oh, what's with Mom? So, you're saying that she's acting weird? How soph—isticated. Careful, guys. You're gonna burn out the CPU with this one.
1;4;M. Night Shaym-Aliens!;Morty;Okay, you know what, Rick? You're acting weird, too.
1;4;M. Night Shaym-Aliens!;Rick;Whatever, quote-unquote “Morty.”
1;4;M. Night Shaym-Aliens!;Morty;Alright, well I'll see you after school. Ow! Oof! Ugh! Damn it! I'm all right. I'm okay.
1;4;M. Night Shaym-Aliens!;Mr. Goldenfold;Alright, who can tell me what 5 x 9 is? Morty?
1;4;M. Night Shaym-Aliens!;Morty;Uh, me?
1;4;M. Night Shaym-Aliens!;Mr. Goldenfold;What is 5 x 9?
1;4;M. Night Shaym-Aliens!;Morty;Um, you know, it's, uh, at least 40.
1;4;M. Night Shaym-Aliens!;Mr. Goldenfold;Morty, that's exactly correct! 5 x 9 is at least 40! Come up here.
1;4;M. Night Shaym-Aliens!;Jessica;Whoo! Way to go, Morty!
1;4;M. Night Shaym-Aliens!;Mr. Goldenfold;Everybody, this is the best student. I want you to be the teacher today. Teach us, Morty!
1;4;M. Night Shaym-Aliens!;Rick;Interesting…
1;4;M. Night Shaym-Aliens!;Morty;W-w-w-what do you want me to teach you?
1;4;M. Night Shaym-Aliens!;Student;Ooh, ooh! How do you make concentrated dark matter?
1;4;M. Night Shaym-Aliens!;Mr. Goldenfold;Oh, that's a good question.
1;4;M. Night Shaym-Aliens!;Morty;Concentrated huh?
1;4;M. Night Shaym-Aliens!;Mr. Goldenfold;Concentrated dark matter. The fuel for accelerated space travel. Now, do you know how to make it?
1;4;M. Night Shaym-Aliens!;Morty;Uhhh…
1;4;M. Night Shaym-Aliens!;Jessica;Come on, Morty. Isn't your grandpa, like, a scientist?
1;4;M. Night Shaym-Aliens!;Morty;Oh, yeah, but, you know, he told me that I shouldn't go around spouting off about, you know, his science and stuff.
1;4;M. Night Shaym-Aliens!;Jessica;I bet you've seen him make concentrated dark matter a lot. You know, if you tell us, I’ll be your girlfriend.
1;4;M. Night Shaym-Aliens!;Morty;Uh, y-you will?
1;4;M. Night Shaym-Aliens!;Mr. Goldenfold;Seems like a rare opportunity, Morty.
1;4;M. Night Shaym-Aliens!;Rick;Morty, u-uh, come on. There's a family emergency.
1;4;M. Night Shaym-Aliens!;Mr. Goldenfold;Stop right there! If he leaves, I'm giving him an F!
1;4;M. Night Shaym-Aliens!;Rick;He doesn't care.
1;4;M. Night Shaym-Aliens!;Morty;Aw, man! Rick, I have to go back! I think I was about to get married! Ugh!
1;4;M. Night Shaym-Aliens!;Rick;Take a shower with me, Morty.
1;4;M. Night Shaym-Aliens!;Morty;What?!
1;4;M. Night Shaym-Aliens!;Rick;Listen to me, Morty. Get your clothes off and get in the shower right now. Y-y-y-you got to trust me, Morty.
1;4;M. Night Shaym-Aliens!;Morty;Ugh! I'm gonna get an F in class, Rick.
1;4;M. Night Shaym-Aliens!;Rick;Morty, that's not class. T-t-t-that wasn't your teacher. This isn't your school. This entire world is not the world. We're inside a huge simulation chamber on an alien spaceship.
1;4;M. Night Shaym-Aliens!;Morty;Wait a minute. W-what are you talking about?
1;4;M. Night Shaym-Aliens!;Rick;It’s all fake Morty, all of it. Nanobotic renderings, a bunch of… crazy, fake nonsense, Morty. I couldn't say so until we got in the shower. They won't monitor us in here.
1;4;M. Night Shaym-Aliens!;Morty;Monitor us?! W-who?!
1;4;M. Night Shaym-Aliens!;Rick;Zigerion scammers, Morty. The galaxy's most ambitious, least successful con artists. You know, it's lucky for us they're also really uncomfortable with nudity.
1;4;M. Night Shaym-Aliens!;Morty;Aw, come on, Rick. If everyone’s just gonna be insane today, at least let me be insane with Jessica.
1;4;M. Night Shaym-Aliens!;Rick;I can’t let you do that, Morty.
1;4;M. Night Shaym-Aliens!;Morty;Give it to me!
1;4;M. Night Shaym-Aliens!;Rick;No! You give it to me!
1;4;M. Night Shaym-Aliens!;Morty;G-g-give it!
1;4;M. Night Shaym-Aliens!;Rick;Morty, come on! Morty!
1;4;M. Night Shaym-Aliens!;Morty;No, Rick!
1;4;M. Night Shaym-Aliens!;Zigerion 1;Oh, god, sir! They're still naked! Ugh.
1;4;M. Night Shaym-Aliens!;Prince Nebulon;Well, check every five quintons and tell me when they're not!
1;4;M. Night Shaym-Aliens!;Zigerion 1;I think we should make Kevin look, sir.
1;4;M. Night Shaym-Aliens!;Kevin;What?! No! W-w-why would you even say that?
1;4;M. Night Shaym-Aliens!;Stu;Uh, sir, we have a situation over here.
1;4;M. Night Shaym-Aliens!;Prince Nebulon;If there's a wiener on that monitor, I swear to god, Stu.
1;4;M. Night Shaym-Aliens!;Stu;Something is drawing a lot of processing power. Oh, wait. No wonder. There's another real human in the simulator.
1;4;M. Night Shaym-Aliens!;Jerry;Okay, Jerry, big pitch meeting. Make-or-break time. You can do this.
1;4;M. Night Shaym-Aliens!;Prince Nebulon;How did this happen?! Where's the Abductions Department?
1;4;M. Night Shaym-Aliens!;Zigerion 2;Hey, man, Abductions just follows the acquisition order.
1;4;M. Night Shaym-Aliens!;Zigerion 3;Don't put this on Acquisitions! We only acquire humans that haven't been simulated!
1;4;M. Night Shaym-Aliens!;Kevin;Well, Simulations doesn't simulate anybody that's been abducted, so—
1;4;M. Night Shaym-Aliens!;Prince Nebulon;Oh, I see! Oh, oh! It was no one's fault. Oh, okay. I'm sorry. Well, then, problem solved. Oh, wait no. There's still another human in here! Who is he?
1;4;M. Night Shaym-Aliens!;Stu;Rick's son-in-law, Jerry Smith. So far, he hasn't noticed he's in a simulation.
1;4;M. Night Shaym-Aliens!;Prince Nebulon;Well, cap his sector at 5% processing, keep his settings on auto, and we'll deal with him later. Rick Sanchez is the target.
1;4;M. Night Shaym-Aliens!;Jerry;Gotta relax. It's just a pitch. Gotta relax.
1;4;M. Night Shaym-Aliens!;Radio;This is earth radio. And now, here's…human music.
1;4;M. Night Shaym-Aliens!;Jerry;Hmm. Human music. I like it.
1;4;M. Night Shaym-Aliens!;Morty;Rick!
1;4;M. Night Shaym-Aliens!;Rick;Uhp, uhp, uhp! Morty, keep your hands off your ding-dong! It's the only way we can speak freely. Look around you, Morty. Do you really think this world is real? You'd have to be an idiot not to notice all the sloppy details. Look, that guy's putting a bun between two hot dogs.
1;4;M. Night Shaym-Aliens!;Morty;I don't know, Rick. I mean, I’ve seen people do that before.
1;4;M. Night Shaym-Aliens!;Rick;Well, look at that old lady. She's, she's walking a cat on a leash.
1;4;M. Night Shaym-Aliens!;Morty;Uh, Mrs. Spencer does that all the time, Rick.
1;4;M. Night Shaym-Aliens!;Rick;Look, I-I-I don't wanna hear about Mrs. Spencer, Morty! She's an idiot! Alright, alright, there. W-what about that, Morty?
1;4;M. Night Shaym-Aliens!;Morty;Okay, okay, you got me on that one.
1;4;M. Night Shaym-Aliens!;Rick;Oh, really, Morty? Are you sure you haven't seen that somewhere in real life before?
1;4;M. Night Shaym-Aliens!;Morty;No, no. I haven't seen that. I mean, why would a Poptart wanna live inside a toaster, Rick? I mean, that would be, like, the scariest place for them to live. You know what I mean?
1;4;M. Night Shaym-Aliens!;Rick;You're missing the point, Morty. Why would he drive a smaller toaster with wheels? I mean, does your car look like a smaller version of your house? No.
1;4;M. Night Shaym-Aliens!;Morty;So, why are they doing this? W-what do they want?
1;4;M. Night Shaym-Aliens!;Rick;Well, that would be obvious to you, Morty, if you'd been paying attention.
1;4;M. Night Shaym-Aliens!;Paramedic;We got the president of the United States in here! We need 10cc of concentrated dark matter, stat, or he'll die!
1;4;M. Night Shaym-Aliens!;Morty;Concentrated dark matter! They were asking about that in class.
1;4;M. Night Shaym-Aliens!;Rick;Yeah, it's a special fuel I invented to travel through space faster than anybody else. These Zigerions are always trying to scam me out of my secrets, but they made a big mistake this time, Morty. They dragged you into this. Now they're gonna pay!
1;4;M. Night Shaym-Aliens!;Morty;Wait, wha, w-w-what are we gonna do?
1;4;M. Night Shaym-Aliens!;Rick;We'll scam the scammers, Morty. And we're gonna take them for everything they've got.
1;4;M. Night Shaym-Aliens!;Jerry;National Apple Farmers of America…
1;4;M. Night Shaym-Aliens!;Jerry;Welcome to our ad agency. I'm Jerry Smith. Alright. I'll just get to the pitch. Um, simple question, gentlemen, what are apples? Excuse me. Ahh. What are apples? Apples are food. And when do we need food? When we're hungry. With that, I give you your new slogan! Well, say something! Do you like it?
1;4;M. Night Shaym-Aliens!;Mr. Marklevitz;Yes.
1;4;M. Night Shaym-Aliens!;Jerry;You do?
1;4;M. Night Shaym-Aliens!;All;Yes.
1;4;M. Night Shaym-Aliens!;Jerry;So I sold it? I sold the idea?
1;4;M. Night Shaym-Aliens!;All;Yes.
1;4;M. Night Shaym-Aliens!;Jerry;Oh my god! Thank you!
1;4;M. Night Shaym-Aliens!;All;Thank you. You're welcome.
1;4;M. Night Shaym-Aliens!;Jerry;Hey! I just sold my first pitch!
1;4;M. Night Shaym-Aliens!;Old man;Slow down!
1;4;M. Night Shaym-Aliens!;Woman;Lookin' good.
1;4;M. Night Shaym-Aliens!;Mailman;My man!
1;4;M. Night Shaym-Aliens!;Simulation Beth;Hello.
1;4;M. Night Shaym-Aliens!;Jerry;Guess who just sold the apples campaign.
1;4;M. Night Shaym-Aliens!;Simulation Beth;Who just sold the apples campaign?
1;4;M. Night Shaym-Aliens!;Jerry;"Me! I guess it wasn't a rip-off of got milk?"" after all. Guess someone was wrong."""
1;4;M. Night Shaym-Aliens!;Simulation Beth;Yes.
1;4;M. Night Shaym-Aliens!;Jerry;Well, all is forgiven, because right now, I’ve got an erection the size of an East Coast lighthouse, and I’m coming home to share it with my beautiful wife.
1;4;M. Night Shaym-Aliens!;Simulation Beth;Okay.
1;4;M. Night Shaym-Aliens!;Jerry;Wait, really?
1;4;M. Night Shaym-Aliens!;Simulation Beth;Yes.
1;4;M. Night Shaym-Aliens!;Jerry;Yes! See you in 10 minutes! Hey! I'm going to make love to my wife!
1;4;M. Night Shaym-Aliens!;Woman;Lookin' good.
1;4;M. Night Shaym-Aliens!;Old man;Slow down!
1;4;M. Night Shaym-Aliens!;Mailman;My man!
1;4;M. Night Shaym-Aliens!;Morty;Aw, geez, Rick. I-I don't know if I like this plan,you know? I mean, crowds, t-t-t-they have a tendency to make me really nervous.
1;4;M. Night Shaym-Aliens!;Rick;Morty, relax. It's just a bunch of 1s and 0s out there. You're gonna be fine. Just follow my lead. Yo, deejay, drop that beat.
1;4;M. Night Shaym-Aliens!;Rick;Uh-oh, Morty. This crowd looks too small for one of our famous rap concerts. I don't think we can perform our new song, The Recipe for Concentrated Dark Matter
1;4;M. Night Shaym-Aliens!;Morty;You got that right, Rick.
1;4;M. Night Shaym-Aliens!;Rick;"Now that’s more like it! Morty, here we go. Let me hear everybody say hey-oh!"" yeah! All the ladies say"
1;4;M. Night Shaym-Aliens!;Jerry;Mm. Mm. Mm. Yeah, don't move. Mm, mm, mm, mm! Mm!
1;4;M. Night Shaym-Aliens!;Rick;"Yo, everyone whose first name begins with an L"" who isn't Hispanic"
1;4;M. Night Shaym-Aliens!;Jerry;Yeah! You like that? Now who's unremarkable? You hungry for apples? Are you hungry for apples?!
1;4;M. Night Shaym-Aliens!;Jerry;Oh, my god. That's the best sex I've ever had in my life. It's… it's too good. I don't deserve this, Beth. I'm a fraud.
1;4;M. Night Shaym-Aliens!;Morty;Oh, man, Rick! W-w-w-where we running to?
1;4;M. Night Shaym-Aliens!;Rick;Out of the simulation, Morty. Normally, the chamber operates like a treadmill, with the virtual world disappearing behind us and being rendered in front of us as we move through it, but while it's frozen, Morty, we can get to…the edge. Here we go.
1;4;M. Night Shaym-Aliens!;Morty;Holy crap!
1;4;M. Night Shaym-Aliens!;Rick;Come on, Morty.
1;4;M. Night Shaym-Aliens!;Zigerion;Sir, they're over the edge.
1;4;M. Night Shaym-Aliens!;Prince Nebulon;Yes, they are. Just as planned. Oh, this is going to be such a mindfuck!
1;4;M. Night Shaym-Aliens!;Rick;Keep your eyes peeled for the central processing room, Morty. That's how we're gonna scam these idiots.
1;4;M. Night Shaym-Aliens!;Morty;So, hey, why do these aliens keep coming after you, Rick, if you're so much smarter than them?
1;4;M. Night Shaym-Aliens!;Rick;It's an obsession for them at this point. The Zigerions have been trying to outsmart me for years, Morty. Every time they do, I'm one step ahead of them. Aha! Here we go. Grab as many processors as you can carry, Morty. These guys aren't good at much, but they're really good at making these chips.
1;4;M. Night Shaym-Aliens!;Morty;I’ve got so many, I can barely hold them all! Look at, look at this. Oops. I dropped one.
1;4;M. Night Shaym-Aliens!;Rick;Don't worry about it, Morty. There's plenty of them, you little goofball. Come here, Morty! Oh, I gotcha!
1;4;M. Night Shaym-Aliens!;Morty;Come on, quit it, Rick! Quit it!
1;4;M. Night Shaym-Aliens!;Rick;Nothing wrong with just a little bit of horseplay every now and then, little fella.
1;4;M. Night Shaym-Aliens!;Morty;Wow. What do you know? Huh. That was easy.
1;4;M. Night Shaym-Aliens!;Rick;Totes malotes, dawg.
1;4;M. Night Shaym-Aliens!;Morty;Just kind of hard to believe, you know?
1;4;M. Night Shaym-Aliens!;Rick;Believe it, Morty. And once again, I'm flying away with everything I can carry, and the Zigerions got nothing of mine.
1;4;M. Night Shaym-Aliens!;Jerry;Mr. Marklevitz, do you have a minute to talk?
1;4;M. Night Shaym-Aliens!;Mr. Marklevitz;Yes.
1;4;M. Night Shaym-Aliens!;Jerry;"Look, I’m a fraud. I mean, let's face it. Hungry for apples"" is just a rip-off of ""Got milk?"" It's almost identical."""
1;4;M. Night Shaym-Aliens!;Mr. Marklevitz;Yes.
1;4;M. Night Shaym-Aliens!;Jerry;Okay. I deserve that. Um, I guess I'll just pack up my desk.
1;4;M. Night Shaym-Aliens!;Mr. Marklevitz;Yes.
1;4;M. Night Shaym-Aliens!;Jerry;"Oh my god. Wait. You know what?! No! The milk people don't have a patent on simple rhetorical questions! Y-You— There's not even a single word in Hungry for Apples"" that's shared by ""Got milk?"" It's a completely different slogan. It's different! And I shouldn't be fired. I should be promoted!"""
1;4;M. Night Shaym-Aliens!;Mr. Marklevitz;Yes.
1;4;M. Night Shaym-Aliens!;Jerry;Yeah! Wait. Really?
1;4;M. Night Shaym-Aliens!;Mr. Marklevitz;Yes.
1;4;M. Night Shaym-Aliens!;Jerry;Yes! I mean, it may be derivative, but it's the most successful campaign to come out of this agency in a long time.
1;4;M. Night Shaym-Aliens!;Mr. Marklevitz;Yes.
1;4;M. Night Shaym-Aliens!;Jerry;I-I’m not saying it should win an award for commercials, but it could certainly be nominated for an award for commercials specifically about apples, like an Appley or something.
1;4;M. Night Shaym-Aliens!;Mr. Marklevitz;Yes.
1;4;M. Night Shaym-Aliens!;Jerry;Is there really an award called the Appley for apple-related ad campaigns?
1;4;M. Night Shaym-Aliens!;Mr. Marklevitz;Yes.
1;4;M. Night Shaym-Aliens!;Jerry;Could we nominate me?
1;4;M. Night Shaym-Aliens!;Mr. Marklevitz;Yes.
1;4;M. Night Shaym-Aliens!;Jerry;Holy crap!
1;4;M. Night Shaym-Aliens!;Rick;Get in, Morty. I'm gonna be able to use these processors to make some real important science stuff. Huh. I thought I entered the code right.
1;4;M. Night Shaym-Aliens!;Prince Nebulon;Well, what's this? W-what could this possibly be? Because it looks like you're inside a simulation…inside a simulation. You're still on the ship. Game-day bucket go boom!
1;4;M. Night Shaym-Aliens!;Cynthia;Sir, the, uh, doctor's appointment to examine the discoloration on your butthole flaps was—
1;4;M. Night Shaym-Aliens!;Prince Nebulon;Too loud, Cynthia. Too loud and too specific.
1;4;M. Night Shaym-Aliens!;Rick;Uhh…
1;4;M. Night Shaym-Aliens!;Prince Nebulon;We've known how to make concentrated dark matter for a long time. But now we also know the code to your fabled safe, Rick Sanchez! All your most valuable secrets will now be ours!
1;4;M. Night Shaym-Aliens!;Rick;Uh, yeah, until I get home before you and change the combination, you bunch of idiots!
1;4;M. Night Shaym-Aliens!;Prince Nebulon;That is why you're never getting home. Get them!
1;4;M. Night Shaym-Aliens!;Rick;RUN MORTY!
1;4;M. Night Shaym-Aliens!;Morty;Oh my god!
1;4;M. Night Shaym-Aliens!;Jerry;I got to tell you, this morning, I didn't even know this award existed. Now I'm holding one. And, um… Look, I want to say that today was the best day of my life But the truth is, it's, it's more meaningful than that.
1;4;M. Night Shaym-Aliens!;Mailman;My man!
1;4;M. Night Shaym-Aliens!;Jerry;Yes. Thank you, sir. I am finally complete!
1;4;M. Night Shaym-Aliens!;Mailmen;My my my my man!
1;4;M. Night Shaym-Aliens!;Jerry;Aah! What the hell?! No.
1;4;M. Night Shaym-Aliens!;Rick;Jerry?!
1;4;M. Night Shaym-Aliens!;Morty;Dad!
1;4;M. Night Shaym-Aliens!;Rick;What are you doing here? W-why are you dressed like a waiter? Screw it. We don't have time. Come on.
1;4;M. Night Shaym-Aliens!;Jerry;No!
1;4;M. Night Shaym-Aliens!;Rick;Man up, Jerry! I may need you to work the lasers.
1;4;M. Night Shaym-Aliens!;Morty;Oh, man! They're hot on our tail, Rick!
1;4;M. Night Shaym-Aliens!;Rick;I guess they really do have concentrated dark matter.
1;4;M. Night Shaym-Aliens!;Morty;Well, you know how to make it, too, right, Rick?
1;4;M. Night Shaym-Aliens!;Rick;Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Uh, check the engine room. We just need cesium, Plutonic quarks, and bottled water.
1;4;M. Night Shaym-Aliens!;Morty;Whoa! It's all here, Rick!
1;4;M. Night Shaym-Aliens!;Rick;Wow, Morty. Lucky break. Grab that bucket. Okay, two parts Plutonic quarks, one part cesium.
1;4;M. Night Shaym-Aliens!;Morty;Okay. Uh-huh. Alright.
1;4;M. Night Shaym-Aliens!;Rick;Now empty the water bottle into the bucket and pour it all into the fuel tank so we can get the hell out of here! What are you doing, Morty?! There's no time!
1;4;M. Night Shaym-Aliens!;Rick;Oh, no.
1;4;M. Night Shaym-Aliens!;Jerry;What the…?
1;4;M. Night Shaym-Aliens!;Rick;No!
1;4;M. Night Shaym-Aliens!;Prince Nebulon;Oh my god, Rick. How dumb are you? You're inside a simulation of a simulation…inside another giant simulation! W-we never had the recipe for concentrated dark matter. But we do now! We do now, sucka!
1;4;M. Night Shaym-Aliens!;Rick;You simulated my grandson's genitalia?! Y-y-you bunch of diabolical sons of bitches!
1;4;M. Night Shaym-Aliens!;Zigerion 1;Kevin fought real hard to supervise that project.
1;4;M. Night Shaym-Aliens!;Kevin;You said you weren't gonna tell anyone! I'm never gonna live this down, am I?
1;4;M. Night Shaym-Aliens!;Rick;All right. Okay. All right, great. Wonderful. You win. Can we go home now?
1;4;M. Night Shaym-Aliens!;Zigerion 1;I don't know. Can you?
1;4;M. Night Shaym-Aliens!;Prince Nebulon;Ha! Nice. Okay, okay. Show this gullible turd to his shuttle. I'm done with him. Oh, wait. Let me get a picture. Aww. Look at his face. He's trying to figure out if He's in a simulation still. Are you, Rick? Are you? You're not. Or are you? Oh, a-and, by the way, I don't have discolored butthole flaps. That was part of the simulation.
1;4;M. Night Shaym-Aliens!;Cynthia;Oh. Uh, sir, should I cancel that appointment, then?
1;4;M. Night Shaym-Aliens!;Prince Nebulon;Yeah! Of course you should! No, keep it. Move it up, actually, if you can.
1;4;M. Night Shaym-Aliens!;Rick;Hey, Jerry, don't worry about it. So what if the most meaningful day of your life was a simulation operating at minimum capacity?
1;4;M. Night Shaym-Aliens!;Jerry;You know what, Rick? Those guys took you for a ride, too. You should try having a little respect for the dummies of the universe, now that you're one of us.
1;4;M. Night Shaym-Aliens!;Rick;Maybe you're right, Jerry. Maybe you're right.
1;4;M. Night Shaym-Aliens!;Prince Nebulon;All right, everybody. Two parts Plutonic quarks… One part cesium…. A-and listen, I’m sorry for shouting earlier. I-I couldn't ask for a better staff. I love you guys, and I love all your families. And the final ingredient…
1;4;M. Night Shaym-Aliens!;Jerry;Whoa! What the hell?! W-what happened back there?
1;4;M. Night Shaym-Aliens!;Rick;Why don't you ask the smartest people in the universe, Jerry? Oh, yeah. You can't. They blew up.
1;4;M. Night Shaym-Aliens!;Jerry;So… What do you think?
1;4;M. Night Shaym-Aliens!;Mr. Marklevitz;You're fired.
1;4;M. Night Shaym-Aliens!;Jerry;Wha--? But t-this idea was tested in a state-of-the-art simulation.
1;4;M. Night Shaym-Aliens!;Mr. Marklevitz;Well, then, it was a terrible simulation. Get out.
1;4;M. Night Shaym-Aliens!;Mr. Marklevitz;Man, how does a guy like that go home and have sex with his wife?
1;4;M. Night Shaym-Aliens!;Rick;Hey, Morty.
1;4;M. Night Shaym-Aliens!;Morty;What?
1;4;M. Night Shaym-Aliens!;Rick;Hey, little buddy. H-h-how you doing in here right now?
1;4;M. Night Shaym-Aliens!;Morty;Aw, geez, Rick. What are you doing, man?
1;4;M. Night Shaym-Aliens!;Rick;Y-y-you're a good kid, Morty. Y-you're a real l-little c-character, Morty.
1;4;M. Night Shaym-Aliens!;Morty;Oh, boy.
1;4;M. Night Shaym-Aliens!;Rick;You know, I had a really rocky road today, M-Morty. You're my little friend, aren't you? We had some good times together, huh, M-Morty? We You're a real true hero out in the field. You're a... You're a real trouper, huh, M-M-Morty?
1;4;M. Night Shaym-Aliens!;Morty;Have you been drinking, Rick?
1;4;M. Night Shaym-Aliens!;Rick;I really appreciate you, Morty.
1;4;M. Night Shaym-Aliens!;Morty;O-okay, cool. A-alright, Rick.
1;4;M. Night Shaym-Aliens!;Rick;You little son of a bitch! Y-y- are you a simulation?! Huh?! Are you a simulation?!
1;4;M. Night Shaym-Aliens!;Morty;No! No! No!
1;4;M. Night Shaym-Aliens!;Rick;You little son of a bitch! I-I-I’m sorry, Morty. Y-you're a good… You're a good kid, Morty.
1;4;M. Night Shaym-Aliens!;Morty;Geez!
1;4;M. Night Shaym-Aliens!;Rick;Y-you're a good… You're a good kid.
1;4;M. Night Shaym-Aliens!;Morty;Oh my god! W-w-what the hell? What a life.
1;5;Meeseeks and Destroy;Rick;Run!
1;5;Meeseeks and Destroy;Rick;Morty, do it! Hit the button now!
1;5;Meeseeks and Destroy;Morty;I can’t do it, Rick! They’re my parents and sister!
1;5;Meeseeks and Destroy;Rick;Morty, I already told you, it’s not your family! They’re clones from an alternate reality possessed by demonic alien spirits from another dimension’s future! Do you need a mnemonic device or something? Just hit the button already!
1;5;Meeseeks and Destroy;Beth;Morty, please. I love you, sweetheart.
1;5;Meeseeks and Destroy;Morty;Ohhhh…
1;5;Meeseeks and Destroy;Rick;Good work, Morty.
1;5;Meeseeks and Destroy;Rick;Y-You know, these demonic alien spirits are really valuable!
1;5;Meeseeks and Destroy;Rick;You okay, Morty? Told you not to trust that tuna.
1;5;Meeseeks and Destroy;Morty;I just killed my family! I don’t care what they were!
1;5;Meeseeks and Destroy;Rick;I dunno, Morty. Some people would pay top dollar for that kinda breakthrough.
1;5;Meeseeks and Destroy;Morty;Y-You know what, Rick? That’s it! I-I’m done with these…insane adventures! That was really traumatizing! I quit! I’m out!
1;5;Meeseeks and Destroy;Rick;Whoa whoa whoa, come on, Morty! D-D-Don’t be like that! The universe is a crazy and chaotic place!
1;5;Meeseeks and Destroy;Morty;You’re the one that’s crazy and chaotic! Adventures are supposed to be simple! And fun!
1;5;Meeseeks and Destroy;Rick;Oh yeah, Morty. Yeah, t-t-that- that’s real easy to say from the sidekick position. But—But, uh, h-how about next time you be in charge, then we’ll talk about how simple and fun it is.
1;5;Meeseeks and Destroy;Morty;Seriously Rick?! Y-You’ll let me call the shots?
1;5;Meeseeks and Destroy;Rick;Okay, fine. But let’s make it interesting, Morty. I-I-If your adventure sucks, and we bail halfway through it, you lose the right to bitch about all future adventures. Plus, you have to do my laundry for a month.
1;5;Meeseeks and Destroy;Morty;Okay, all right, tough guy! But if my adventure's good... I get to be in charge of every third adventure!
1;5;Meeseeks and Destroy;Rick;Every 10th.
1;5;Meeseeks and Destroy;Morty;Deal. All right. Well, come on, let's get going.
1;5;Meeseeks and Destroy;Beth;Dad, the dishwasher's doing that thing again.
1;5;Meeseeks and Destroy;Rick;Washing dishes?
1;5;Meeseeks and Destroy;Beth;No. The opposite. Can you fix it?
1;5;Meeseeks and Destroy;Summer;Grandpa Rick, can you help me with my science homework?
1;5;Meeseeks and Destroy;Rick;Yeah just don't do it.
1;5;Meeseeks and Destroy;Summer;Grandpa!
1;5;Meeseeks and Destroy;Jerry;Hey, Rick, you got some kind of hand-shaped device that can open this mayonnaise jar?
1;5;Meeseeks and Destroy;Rick;Wow. Hat trick. All right, Morty, let's put a pin in this. I got to help your pathetic family.
1;5;Meeseeks and Destroy;Morty;Oh, that sounds like something a chicken would say. Bawk, bawk, bawk, bawk, bawk, bawk.
1;5;Meeseeks and Destroy;Rick;Oh, Morty, you done did it this time. It's on. I can't wait to watch your adventure lay a huge fart. As for you dingdongs... This is a Meeseeks box. Let me show you how it works. You press this.
1;5;Meeseeks and Destroy;Meeseeks,I'm Mr. Meeseeks! Look at me!;
1;5;Meeseeks and Destroy;Rick;You make a request. Mr. Meeseeks, open Jerry's stupid mayonnaise jar.
1;5;Meeseeks and Destroy;Meeseeks;Yes, siree!
1;5;Meeseeks and Destroy;Rick;The Meeseeks fulfills the request.
1;5;Meeseeks and Destroy;Meeseeks;All done!
1;5;Meeseeks and Destroy;Jerry;Wow!
1;5;Meeseeks and Destroy;Rick;And then it stops existing.
1;5;Meeseeks and Destroy;Summer;Oh, my God, he exploded!
1;5;Meeseeks and Destroy;Rick;Trust me, they're fine with it. Knock yourselves out just keep your requests simple. They're not gods.
1;5;Meeseeks and Destroy;Morty;All right! Get out of here now! Everybody out of here! I got a bet to win!
1;5;Meeseeks and Destroy;Beth;So many possibilities.
1;5;Meeseeks and Destroy;Summer;My mind is racing.
1;5;Meeseeks and Destroy;Jerry;If we're gonna use this thing, which I'm not even sure we should, we need to keep it simple.
1;5;Meeseeks and Destroy;Meeseeks;I'm Mr. Meeseeks!
1;5;Meeseeks and Destroy;Summer;I want to be popular at school!
1;5;Meeseeks and Destroy;Meeseeks;Ooh, okay!
1;5;Meeseeks and Destroy;Jerry;Summer, what did I just-
1;5;Meeseeks and Destroy;Meeseeks 2;Ooh, I'm Mr. Meeseeks! Look at me!
1;5;Meeseeks and Destroy;Beth;I want... I want to be a more complete woman!
1;5;Meeseeks and Destroy;Jerry;Beth!
1;5;Meeseeks and Destroy;Meeseeks 2;Oh, yeah! Yes, ma'am!
1;5;Meeseeks and Destroy;Jerry;"You guys are doing it wrong. He said simple."""""
1;5;Meeseeks and Destroy;Meeseeks 3;Hey, there. I'm Mr. Meeseeks!
1;5;Meeseeks and Destroy;Jerry;Mr. Meeseeks, I would like to take two strokes off my golf game.
1;5;Meeseeks and Destroy;Meeseeks 3;Ooh, yeah! Can do!
1;5;Meeseeks and Destroy;Jerry;Nailed it.
1;5;Meeseeks and Destroy;Rick;God, Morty, what a boring start to an adventure. Why didn't we just go to Kentucky?
1;5;Meeseeks and Destroy;Morty;Rick, this is a fantasy-type world with creatures and all sorts of fantasy things. We're going on a quest, okay?
1;5;Meeseeks and Destroy;Rick;Can't wait.
1;5;Meeseeks and Destroy;Morty;Ahem. Excuse me! We are two humble heroes in search of adventure!
1;5;Meeseeks and Destroy;Rick;Oh, my God, so embarrassing.
1;5;Meeseeks and Destroy;Villager;At last! Two heroes! You must help us! This village is terribly poor, yet the giant that lives in the clouds above has untold treasures!
1;5;Meeseeks and Destroy;Morty;You know what? I accept your call to adventure, good sir, kind sir. Come on, Rick. There's a giant in the clouds!
1;5;Meeseeks and Destroy;Rick;Yeah. Beginner's luck.
1;5;Meeseeks and Destroy;Meeseeks 1;In conclusion, a friendship with Summer Smith is the most valuable and enriching experience of your young lives. I'm Mr. Meeseeks! Look at me! Thank you!
1;5;Meeseeks and Destroy;Principal Gene V.;Uh, Mr. Meeseeks, was it? Yeah. Gene Vagina. Listen, I'm in a bit of custody thing with my ex and was wondering- No, I'll get your info from Summer.
1;5;Meeseeks and Destroy;Beth;I got pregnant at 17. I mean, I still put myself through veterinary school. Yes, I'm successful, but what if I hadn't...- I'm just saying, somewhere along the way, I lost that wide-eyed girl from muskegon.
1;5;Meeseeks and Destroy;Meeseeks 2;She's still there, Beth.
1;5;Meeseeks and Destroy;Beth;Well, her waistline isn't.
1;5;Meeseeks and Destroy;Meeseeks 2;Beth, having a family doesn't mean that you stop being an individual. You know the best thing you can do for people that depend on you? Be honest with them, even if it means setting them free.
1;5;Meeseeks and Destroy;Beth;You're saying I should leave Jerry. I can't believe I'm finally having this conversation.
1;5;Meeseeks and Destroy;Waiter;More wine?
1;5;Meeseeks and Destroy;Beth;I think I've had enough.
1;5;Meeseeks and Destroy;Meeseeks 3;Remember to square your shoulders, Jerry.
1;5;Meeseeks and Destroy;Jerry;Yeah, yeah. I got it.
1;5;Meeseeks and Destroy;Meeseeks 3;That's okay. I'm Mr. Meeseeks! Look at me! Try again and keep your head down.
1;5;Meeseeks and Destroy;Jerry;Okay, well, which is it? Square my shoulders or keep my head down?
1;5;Meeseeks and Destroy;Meeseeks 3;Well, it's both. But most importantly, you got to relax.
1;5;Meeseeks and Destroy;Jerry;You know what, Mr. Meeseeks? I don't think this is working. I give up.
1;5;Meeseeks and Destroy;Meeseeks 3;I'm sorry, Jerry, but it doesn't work like that. I'm Mr. Meeseeks. I have to fulfill my purpose so I can go away. Look at me.
1;5;Meeseeks and Destroy;Jerry;Well, make yourself comfortable, because I suck.
1;5;Meeseeks and Destroy;Meeseeks 3;No, Jerry, I'm the one who SUCKS! Let me try something.
1;5;Meeseeks and Destroy;Meeseeks 4;I'm Mr. Meeseeks! Look at me!
1;5;Meeseeks and Destroy;Meeseeks 3;Hi, Mr. Meeseeks! I'm Mr. Meeseeks! Look at me.
1;5;Meeseeks and Destroy;Meeseeks 4;Hi!
1;5;Meeseeks and Destroy;Meeseeks 3;Can you help me get two strokes off of Jerry's golf swing?
1;5;Meeseeks and Destroy;Meeseeks 4;Can do! I'm Mr. Meeseeks! Is he keeping his shoulders squared?
1;5;Meeseeks and Destroy;Meeseeks 3;Ooh, he's trying!
1;5;Meeseeks and Destroy;Rick;All right, Morty. We're in your stupid giant's castle. What do we do next?
1;5;Meeseeks and Destroy;Morty;Would you just relax, Rick? All we got to do is find the treasure room, okay? It's nice and simple. You know, I'm sorry everything's going so smoothly and adventurously.
1;5;Meeseeks and Destroy;Rick;Uh-oh, Morty. Startin' to get a little hairy. What do you want to do, boss?
1;5;Meeseeks and Destroy;Morty;Come on, hurry. Behind this cookie jar.
1;5;Meeseeks and Destroy;Giant;Fee! Fi! Fo! Fum!
1;5;Meeseeks and Destroy;Rick;Just give up, Morty. This is game over. I'll take us home right now. You just say the word.
1;5;Meeseeks and Destroy;Morty;No way, Rick. This is all part of it. Adventures have conflict. Deal with it.
1;5;Meeseeks and Destroy;Giant;I smell the blood of- whoop!
1;5;Meeseeks and Destroy;Morty;Holy crap.
1;5;Meeseeks and Destroy;Rick;Oh, boy. He looks pretty bad down there, Morty. Looks like he's bleeding out.
1;5;Meeseeks and Destroy;Giant woman;Oh, Jesus! Dale! You sons of bitches! Oh, man. Hello, 911? My husband has been attacked by tiny people! He's dying!
1;5;Meeseeks and Destroy;Detective;Hey, look, we get it. You're little, you're down on your luck, you think, hey
1;5;Meeseeks and Destroy;Morty;Th-th but that's not how it went down!
1;5;Meeseeks and Destroy;Detective;Oh, well, it's going down like that. You're both going down like that.
1;5;Meeseeks and Destroy;Rick;Ooh, boy, Morty, you're really showing me how it's done. Real straightforward and fun.
1;5;Meeseeks and Destroy;Summer;Like, letting go of the need to be popular is what makes people like you.
1;5;Meeseeks and Destroy;Beth;The most important love you can receive is from yourself.
1;5;Meeseeks and Destroy;Meeseeks;Okay, Jerry, you got to just choke up on the club!
1;5;Meeseeks and Destroy;Jerry;Well, which is it, choke up or follow-through?!
1;5;Meeseeks and Destroy;Meeseeks;Aww, come on, Jerry, we've been over this. You know you got to do both! This is as frustrating for us as it is for you.
1;5;Meeseeks and Destroy;Jerry;Don't tell me that! That just puts pressure on me!
1;5;Meeseeks and Destroy;Meeseeks;Just try to relax.
1;5;Meeseeks and Destroy;Jerry;You try to relax! Have you ever tried to relax?! It is a paradox! Ugh, these Meeseeks, huh? Kind of a handful. I can't imagine what you two must be going through.
1;5;Meeseeks and Destroy;Beth;Our Meeseeks have been gone for hours, Jerry.
1;5;Meeseeks and Destroy;Jerry;You're kidding me.
1;5;Meeseeks and Destroy;Beth;Notice anything different?
1;5;Meeseeks and Destroy;Jerry;I'm sorry. Hours?
1;5;Meeseeks and Destroy;Summer;Dad, mom is a beautiful woman! Look at her! You will lose her!
1;5;Meeseeks and Destroy;Meeseeks;Uhh... Hey, Jerry, you mind if we get back to the task at hand? Meeseeks don't usually have to exist this long. It's getting weird.
1;5;Meeseeks and Destroy;Judge;Order in the court! Before the jury reaches its verdict, I just want to say that I consider you both very guilty.
1;5;Meeseeks and Destroy;Rick;Oh, great adventure, buddy. Rick and Morty go to giant prison. You know, if somebody drops the soap, it's gonna land on our heads and crush our spines, Morty. You know, it'll be really easy to rape us after that.
1;5;Meeseeks and Destroy;Morty;We're gonna be okay, Rick.
1;5;Meeseeks and Destroy;Rick;How? They took my portal gun. This is an open-and-shut case, Morty. You know, what do you think's gonna happen, some magical angel's gonna show up and then-
1;5;Meeseeks and Destroy;Giant Lawyer;Fee! Fi! Fo! Fum! I smell the violation of civil liberties! Your honor, I'm from a tiny-persons advocacy group and I have here in my hand a motion to dismiss. These little men were never read their giant rights and are therefore free-fi to fo-home.
1;5;Meeseeks and Destroy;Rick;W-what the hell is he talking about?
1;5;Meeseeks and Destroy;Giant Lawyer;They're free to go, is what I meant. I'm deconstructing our our our thing we say. We're giants. Nobody got that? Whatever.
1;5;Meeseeks and Destroy;Morty;Oh, man, what did I tell you, Rick? We did it!
1;5;Meeseeks and Destroy;Rick;All right, Morty, looks like the portal gun's still working. You ready to head home?
1;5;Meeseeks and Destroy;Morty;Oh, yeah, you'd like that, wouldn't you, Rick? Well, you know what? We're not bailing out just yet. You know, we're gonna go find some treasure or something and and we're gonna bring it to those villagers.
1;5;Meeseeks and Destroy;Rick;Morty, cut your losses. This is obviously awash.
1;5;Meeseeks and Destroy;Morty;Yeah, you were saying that back when we first got arrested, but here we are, you know, walking down the courthouse steps.
1;5;Meeseeks and Destroy;Rick;Oh, boy, Morty.
1;5;Meeseeks and Destroy;Morty;Usually, walking down the courthouse steps is the easy part of the adventure.
1;5;Meeseeks and Destroy;Rick;What do you say, Morty?
1;5;Meeseeks and Destroy;Morty;I say give me a hand, sidekick.
1;5;Meeseeks and Destroy;Jerry;Everybody shut up! Let me try! Damn it! Damn it! Damn it!
1;5;Meeseeks and Destroy;Beth;I'm going out.
1;5;Meeseeks and Destroy;Jerry;Wait. What?
1;5;Meeseeks and Destroy;Beth;Well, you're busy. I'm hungry. I thought I'd go out. Do you want me to be happy or do you want me to be in prison?
1;5;Meeseeks and Destroy;Jerry;Whoa, whoa, where in the hell is, I'll take you to dinner.
1;5;Meeseeks and Destroy;All the Meeseeks,AWWWWWWW!;
1;5;Meeseeks and Destroy;Jerry;Hey, you know what? It's hard being me, too. I'll be right there. Look, I've got a marriage to keep together. At this point, my golf swing is more your problem than mine.
1;5;Meeseeks and Destroy;Meeseeks;I can't take it anymore. I just want to die!
1;5;Meeseeks and Destroy;Meeseeks *;We all want to die! We're Meeseeks! Why did you even rope me into this?
1;5;Meeseeks and Destroy;Meeseeks *;'Cause he roped me into this!
1;5;Meeseeks and Destroy;Meeseeks *;Well, him over there, he roped me into this!
1;5;Meeseeks and Destroy;Meeseeks *;Well, he roped me into this!
1;5;Meeseeks and Destroy;Meeseeks *;Well, what about me? He roped me into this.
1;5;Meeseeks and Destroy;Meeseeks *;Well, that one over there roped me into this.
1;5;Meeseeks and Destroy;Meeseeks *;Well, he roped me into this.
1;5;Meeseeks and Destroy;Rick;Yeah, Morty, this is the part of the story everybody loves scaling down 650,000 oversized steps.
1;5;Meeseeks and Destroy;Morty;All right, okay, you know, if this was a story, this part wouldn't be included, stupid. Hey, Rick, what do you know? Look down there. Looks like some kind of tavern or something built right into the side of the step.
1;5;Meeseeks and Destroy;Morty;Oh, wow, Rick. Now, this is more like it. Look, there's little staircase-shaped people in here. All kinds of crazy characters. This place is great, you know? It's whimsical and fun.
1;5;Meeseeks and Destroy;Rick;What are you looking at, motherfucker?
1;5;Meeseeks and Destroy;Morty;Easy, Rick.
1;5;Meeseeks and Destroy;Waitress;Pay them no mind. Those stair goblins can be moody. Now, what can I getcha? We've got skarlog poppies, flurlow, halzingers, bloogies, juicy time babies.
1;5;Meeseeks and Destroy;Rick;Yeah, yeah, yeah, how about some scotch whiskey? You got any of that around here? Or just a bunch of nonsense words?
1;5;Meeseeks and Destroy;Morty;Rick... We'll have two bloogies, please. And, uh, we were wondering, is there a faster way two heroes could get down these stairs?
1;5;Meeseeks and Destroy;Slippery;Y'all need to ride down the stairs? My name is slippely-slippery stair. I'll take you down there for 25 shmeckels.
1;5;Meeseeks and Destroy;Rick;25 shmeckels? I don't know how much I don't know what that is. Is that a lot? Is it a little?
1;5;Meeseeks and Destroy;Waitress;That's exactly how much I spent on my big fake boobies.
1;5;Meeseeks and Destroy;Mr. Booby Buyer;Hi, I'm Mr. Booby Buyer. I'll buy those boobies for 25 shmeckels.
1;5;Meeseeks and Destroy;Waitess;It's a tempting offer, but I'm gonna have to decline.
1;5;Meeseeks and Destroy;Mr. Booby Buyer;Rats! What a shame.
1;5;Meeseeks and Destroy;Rick;Morty, your adventure's in a spiral. For real, man, time to pull out.
1;5;Meeseeks and Destroy;Morty;You keep heckling my adventure, Rick! You know why?
1;5;Meeseeks and Destroy;Rick;Uh, because it's lame?
1;5;Meeseeks and Destroy;Morty;It's because you're petty! You know, how many times have I had to follow you into some nonsensical bull crap? I always roll with the punches, Rick. Why can't you? Look, I got to take a leak, and when I come back, if you haven't learned how to lighten up, don't be here!
1;5;Meeseeks and Destroy;Rick;Whatever.
1;5;Meeseeks and Destroy;Meeseeks;It's become clear-look at me- that if we concentrate all our efforts on Jerry's follow-through, we will solve this problem. I'm Mr. Meeseeks.
1;5;Meeseeks and Destroy;Meeseeks *;I'm Mr. Meeseeks. Look at me. The only thing that's clear is that choking up is the one true solution.
1;5;Meeseeks and Destroy;Meeseeks 3;Look at me. I'm Mr. Meeseeks. I've been trying to help Jerry for two days, an eternity in Meeseeks time, and nothing's worked. I fear the worst.
1;5;Meeseeks and Destroy;Meeseeks;Your failures are your own, old man. I'm Mr. Meeseeks! Look at me. I say follow-through! Who's with me?! Follow-through!
1;5;Meeseeks and Destroy;New Meeseeks;I'm Mr. Meeseeks! Look at me!
1;5;Meeseeks and Destroy;Meeseeks;Kill him!
1;5;Meeseeks and Destroy;New Meeseeks;Hisssss!
1;5;Meeseeks and Destroy;Mr. Jelly Bean;How are you today? I'm Mr. Jelly Bean!
1;5;Meeseeks and Destroy;Morty;Hi, Mr. Jelly Bean. I'm Morty. My grandpa and I are on an adventure.
1;5;Meeseeks and Destroy;Mr. Jelly Bean;Nice. Is it a fun adventure?
1;5;Meeseeks and Destroy;Morty;I hope so. But I'm starting to get nervous that maybe it's gone a little too far off the rails.
1;5;Meeseeks and Destroy;Mr. Jelly Bean;Well, isn't that what adventures do?
1;5;Meeseeks and Destroy;Morty;Hey, you know what? You're right. Everything's going fine. I just got to relax and go with the flow.
1;5;Meeseeks and Destroy;Mr. Jelly Bean;Yeah.
1;5;Meeseeks and Destroy;Morty;Okay. Uh. B-bye.
1;5;Meeseeks and Destroy;Mr. Jelly Bean;Uhh, no, stay. Go with the flow!
1;5;Meeseeks and Destroy;Morty;Stop. You're making me really uncomfortable.
1;5;Meeseeks and Destroy;Mr. Jelly Bean;Stop fighting me! Just let this happen!
1;5;Meeseeks and Destroy;Morty;Get off of me!
1;5;Meeseeks and Destroy;Rick;Sweet home Alabama. Wooooo!
1;5;Meeseeks and Destroy;Morty;Whoo! No! Stop! Please!
1;5;Meeseeks and Destroy;Mr. Jelly Bean;Stop being such a fucking tease, you sweet little twat!
1;5;Meeseeks and Destroy;Morty;No! No!
1;5;Meeseeks and Destroy;Meeseeks;Everybody sto-o-o-p! Look at me! My brothers, nothing will be accomplished by shedding Meeseeks blood. None of us can die until our job is done.
1;5;Meeseeks and Destroy;Meeseeks *;The job can't be done! We'll never get two strokes off his game!
1;5;Meeseeks and Destroy;Meeseeks;No, we won't. But we will get all strokes off his game.
1;5;Meeseeks and Destroy;All other Meeseeks;Where's he going with this? What does he mean?
1;5;Meeseeks and Destroy;Meeseeks;When we kill him!
1;5;Meeseeks and Destroy;Beth;Jerry, maybe it's time I take that trip I always talk about.
1;5;Meeseeks and Destroy;Jerry;Where would you go?
1;5;Meeseeks and Destroy;Beth;I don't know, man. Italy. Greece. Argentina.
1;5;Meeseeks and Destroy;Jerry;Countries known for their sexually aggressive men. Did I tell you how much I love your new haircut?
1;5;Meeseeks and Destroy;Jerry;What the heck?
1;5;Meeseeks and Destroy;Meeseeks;There he is!
1;5;Meeseeks and Destroy;Beth;Run, Jerry!
1;5;Meeseeks and Destroy;Meeseeks;Come on out, Jerry!
1;5;Meeseeks and Destroy;Jerry;Guys, I'll choke up. I'll follow through. I'll do whatever you tell me to do, okay?
1;5;Meeseeks and Destroy;Meeseeks;Oh, we're well past that, Jerry.
1;5;Meeseeks and Destroy;Card Player;Come on, Rick, quit stalling. What do ya got?
1;5;Meeseeks and Destroy;Rick;Read 'em and weep, fellas! Oh, hey, Morty. Listen, I'm really sorry about all that stuff I said earlier about your adventure. I'm havin' a good time, Morty. It's not so bad.
1;5;Meeseeks and Destroy;Morty;Let's just go home, okay? I'm calling it. The adventure's over.
1;5;Meeseeks and Destroy;Rick;We can't leave now, Morty. I'm on fire!
1;5;Meeseeks and Destroy;Morty;Look, I want to leave now. You win the bet, okay? Just give me the portal gun and let's go, please!
1;5;Meeseeks and Destroy;Morty;Please, I just want to... go h-home.
1;5;Meeseeks and Destroy;Rick;Okay. Listen, Morty. I just won a bunch of shmeckels. Why don't we use 25 of them to pay slippery stair here for a ride back to the village, and then we'll give the rest of the shmeckels to the villagers, huh?
1;5;Meeseeks and Destroy;Morty;Really?
1;5;Meeseeks and Destroy;Rick;Sure, Morty. Yeah. You know, a good adventure needs a good ending.
1;5;Meeseeks and Destroy;Slippery;Buckle up!
1;5;Meeseeks and Destroy;Meeseeks;Meeseeks are not born into this world fumbling for meaning, Jerry! We are created to serve a singular purpose for which we will go to any lengths to fulfill! Existence is pain to a Meeseeks, Jerry. And we will do anything to alleviate that pain. Just ask... ...what's your name, ma'am?
1;5;Meeseeks and Destroy;Woman;Samantha. Please, mister! Give him what he wants!
1;5;Meeseeks and Destroy;Jerry;Innocent people are going to die because of me. Why am I so mediocre?
1;5;Meeseeks and Destroy;Beth;Jerry, turn around. Straighten your back. Bend your knees. Bend them. Square your shoulders. Take a deep breath. I love you.
1;5;Meeseeks and Destroy;Meeseeks;I'm counting to three, Jerry.
1;5;Meeseeks and Destroy;All Meeseeks;Ooooohhh!
1;5;Meeseeks and Destroy;Samantha;What the fuck is going on?
1;5;Meeseeks and Destroy;All Meeseeks;He's got it! That's a lower handicap stro-o-ke!
1;5;Meeseeks and Destroy;Meeseeks;Excuse me. I'm a bit of a stickler Meeseeks. What about your short game?
1;5;Meeseeks and Destroy;Samantha;Oh, my God, oh, my God! What about your short game?!
1;5;Meeseeks and Destroy;Meeseeks;Ooh, nice!
1;5;Meeseeks and Destroy;Jerry;I think we'll take our food to go.
1;5;Meeseeks and Destroy;Owner;No, you won't. The police are coming. You have so many questions to answer.
1;5;Meeseeks and Destroy;Jerry;Fair enough.
1;5;Meeseeks and Destroy;The First Villager;Thank you, kind sir. Our village is saved! You are both true heroes!
1;5;Meeseeks and Destroy;Rick;Good job, Morty. Looks like you won the bet.
1;5;Meeseeks and Destroy;Morty;Thanks, Rick, but I don't know if I should. You know, you were right about the universe. It's a crazy and chaotic place.
1;5;Meeseeks and Destroy;Rick;Well, you know, maybe that's why it could use a little cleaning up every now and then, you know. This one's wrapped up neat and clean because we did it Morty style.
1;5;Meeseeks and Destroy;The First Villager;Oh! Heroes, we would like to introduce you to our beloved king so that he may thank you personally.
1;5;Meeseeks and Destroy;Morty;Uh, no, I-it's cool. Rick. Portal. Hurry.
1;5;Meeseeks and Destroy;Jerry;So... You still thinking about taking that trip?
1;5;Meeseeks and Destroy;Beth;"Jerry, look. We don't have a perfect marriage, but I'm not going anywhere. When we were in that freezer, I realized the Meeseeks are like the guys I went to high school with willing to say anything to complete their task."""""
1;5;Meeseeks and Destroy;Jerry;Was I one of those guys?
1;5;Meeseeks and Destroy;Beth;The difference is you didn't disappear afterwards.
1;5;Meeseeks and Destroy;Jerry;Well... I got you pregnant.
1;5;Meeseeks and Destroy;Beth;Yeah...
1;5;Meeseeks and Destroy;Rick;What the hell happened to this place?
1;5;Meeseeks and Destroy;Beth;Uh, your Meeseeks box happened. They went crazy when they couldn't take two strokes off Jerry's golf game. He felt terrible.
1;5;Meeseeks and Destroy;Rick;Hey, it's not my fault that Jerry's an idiot.
1;5;Meeseeks and Destroy;Beth;Dad! Is there anything you can do to clean this place up?
1;5;Meeseeks and Destroy;Rick;Well, you know, I do have a Fleeseeks box.
1;5;Meeseeks and Destroy;Jerry;No. No more boxes.
1;5;Meeseeks and Destroy;Rick;What? It just has a mop and some floor wax in it. Wubba lubba dub dub! Yeah! That's my new thing! I'm kind of like what's his name Arsenio. Isn't that it's what Arsenio used to say on his show. Wobble gobba lop bops! Right? See you next week, everybody.
1;5;Meeseeks and Destroy;Beth;I don't get it.
1;5;Meeseeks and Destroy;Villager 1;Sir, I think you're going to want to see this. We found it inside a lockbox inside king Jelly Bean's closet. We have to tell the people.
1;5;Meeseeks and Destroy;Villager 2;Wait. Destroy it. Our people will get more from the idea he represented... than from the jelly bean he actually was.
1;6;Rick Potion 9;Principal Vagina;Principal Vagina here, don't let the name fool you, I'm very much in charge, reminding you that tonight is our annual flu season dance. I don't know how many times I have to say this but if you have the flu, stay home, the flu season dance is about awareness, not celebration. You don't bring dead babies to Passover.
1;6;Rick Potion 9;Morty;Ohhh. Okay, here we go. H-Heyy Jessica, ughh.
1;6;Rick Potion 9;Jessica;What's up Morty?
1;6;Rick Potion 9;Morty;Ugghh
1;6;Rick Potion 9;Brad;What are you doing?
1;6;Rick Potion 9;Morty;Ummm
1;6;Rick Potion 9;Brad;Wait, wait, Were you about to talk... to her?
1;6;Rick Potion 9;Morty;Well, I mean, I was thinking about it.
1;6;Rick Potion 9;Brad;Dude, Stay in your league! Look at how hot she is! You don't see me going to a bigger school, in a wealthier district and hittin' on their prettiest girl!
1;6;Rick Potion 9;Jessica;Gee, thanks, Brad.
1;6;Rick Potion 9;Brad;I throw balls far. You want good words, date a languager.
1;6;Rick Potion 9;Jerry;Eh, Try not to worry about it, Morty. You're a good kid, and there's not a premium on that right now, but you'll be getting girls sometime after Brad's out of shape.
1;6;Rick Potion 9;Morty;You're missing the point, Dad. I don't want girls, I want Jessica!
1;6;Rick Potion 9;Jerry;Ahhh, well, I remember feeling that way about a young lady named your mom, and that's not an urban dis, your mom was my Jessica. I remember the first time I saw her, I thought...
1;6;Rick Potion 9;Rick;I should get her pregnant, then she'll have to marry me.
1;6;Rick Potion 9;Jerry;I beg your pardon, Rick, INAPPROPRIATE.
1;6;Rick Potion 9;Rick;Sorry, please proceed with your story about banging my daughter in high school.  I'm not sure you want to take romantic advice from this guy, Morty, his marriage is hanging from a thread.
1;6;Rick Potion 9;Jerry;My marriage is fine, thank you.
1;6;Rick Potion 9;Rick;Jerry, it's your house, whatever you say it is is how it is,  but I think a blind man could see that Beth is looking for the door. I barely have a reason to care and even I noticed.
1;6;Rick Potion 9;Morty;Come on, Rick, don't talk about my parents like that.
1;6;Rick Potion 9;Rick;"Listen, Morty, I hate to break it to you, but what people call ""love"" is a chemical reaction that compels animals to breed. It hits hard, Morty, then it slowly fades, leaving you stranded in a failing marriage. I did it, your parents are gonna do it. Break the cycle, Morty. Rise above. Focus on science."
1;6;Rick Potion 9;Morty;Alright, well, I'm gonna go get dressed for the dance.
1;6;Rick Potion 9;Jerry;Yeah, I'm just going to...check on your mom.
1;6;Rick Potion 9;Rick;Morty, hand me that screwdriver, huh?  I'm almost finished making my ionic defibulizer, Morty. It's gonna be great.
1;6;Rick Potion 9;Morty;Hey, listen, Rick. You know how you said that, you know... love is a chemical and all that stuff from earlier?  Well, I was thinkn', you know, www... could you make some sort of chemical thing happen inside of Jessica's mind, you know, so where she falls in love with me and all that sort of thing, you know, like maybe make some sort of love potion or something?
1;6;Rick Potion 9;Rick;Morty, that's such a poor use of my time, it's beneath me. Hand me the screwdriver.
1;6;Rick Potion 9;Morty;YOU KNOW WHAT, NO RICK! I'M NOT GONNA HAND YOU THE SCREWDRIVER! Uh, I'm never gonna hand you anything ever again, Rick.  I'm always helping you with this and that and the other thing. Www...what about me, Rick? Www... why can't you just help me out once, once, for once?
1;6;Rick Potion 9;Rick;You're growing up fast, Morty. You're growing into a real big thorn straight up into my ass!  Listen, this is called oxytocin. I extracted it from a vole. You know what a VOLE is, Morty, you know what a vole is?
1;6;Rick Potion 9;Rick;It's a, it's a rodent that mates for life, Morty. This is the chemical release in the mammal's brain,  ...that makes it fall in love. Alright Morty, I just gotta  combine it with some of your DNA.
1;6;Rick Potion 9;Morty;Oh well, okay...
1;6;Rick Potion 9;Rick;A hair, Morty, I need one of your hairs! This isn't Game Of Thrones.
1;6;Rick Potion 9;Morty;Oww!
1;6;Rick Potion 9;Rick;Alright, Morty, whoever you smear this stuff on will fall in love with you, and only you, forever. Ya happy now, Morty?
1;6;Rick Potion 9;Morty;Heck yeah! Thank you, Grandpa Rick!  Hey there's no dangers or anything or side effects, right?
1;6;Rick Potion 9;Rick;Www.. what am I, a hack?! Go nuts, Morty, it's full proof.
1;6;Rick Potion 9;Rick;Ugh, unless she has the flu.
1;6;Rick Potion 9;Jerry;Beth, do you still love me?
1;6;Rick Potion 9;Beth;Want kinda question is that?
1;6;Rick Potion 9;Jerry;"The ""yes"" or ""no"" kind."
1;6;Rick Potion 9;Beth;Jerry, do you want homeless people to have homes?
1;6;Rick Potion 9;Jerry;Yess.
1;6;Rick Potion 9;Beth;Are you gonna build them?
1;6;Rick Potion 9;Jerry;Noo.
1;6;Rick Potion 9;Beth;"Then what good was the ""yes""?"
1;6;Rick Potion 9;Jerry;Wait, iii... is loving me the house or the homeless people?
1;6;Rick Potion 9;Beth;"Loving you is work, Jerry, hard work, like building a homeless shelter. Nobody want to say ""no"" to doing it, but some people put the work in. So what do ya say? Do you see me working here? Does this conversation seem tedious to me?"
1;6;Rick Potion 9;Jerry;Sort of.
1;6;Rick Potion 9;Beth;But I obviously sort of love you, don't I?  So stop asking and maybe I'll love you more. Crap, They need me at the horse hospital.
1;6;Rick Potion 9;Jerry;This late?
1;6;Rick Potion 9;Beth;The racetrack had a starlit derby, there's a seven horse collision, and Davin's there alone.
1;6;Rick Potion 9;Morty;Hey there, Jessica. Whooa-whoopsie!
1;6;Rick Potion 9;Jessica;Omigod, Morty. You look REALLY nice tonight.
1;6;Rick Potion 9;Morty;WOW, thanks!
1;6;Rick Potion 9;Jessica;I love you, Morty. I love you so much it burns!
1;6;Rick Potion 9;Morty;Oh man. I love you too, Jessica!
1;6;Rick Potion 9;Brad;Is this punk bothering you, Jessica?
1;6;Rick Potion 9;Jessica;LEAVE HIM ALONE, JERK!  I'M IN LOVE WITH HIM! HE'S MORE MAN THEN YOU WILL EVER BE!
1;6;Rick Potion 9;Brad;Aw man, Morty, ugh, I'm really sorry.
1;6;Rick Potion 9;Morty;Oh, well, no problem Brad.
1;6;Rick Potion 9;Brad;There's somethin' special bout you, somethin' special.
1;6;Rick Potion 9;Morty;Whoa, take it easy!
1;6;Rick Potion 9;Jessica;GET YOUR HANDS OFF OF HIM!
1;6;Rick Potion 9;Brad;BACK OFF I'M TRYING TO BE WITH MY MAN!
1;6;Rick Potion 9;Principal Vagina;That's enough Bradley. We don't want you injuring your ball-throwing arm.
1;6;Rick Potion 9;Brad;Oh, Principal Vagina.
1;6;Rick Potion 9;Jessica;Never leave me, Morty, NEVER.
1;6;Rick Potion 9;Morty;Uh, sure. I mean, of course not. What do you think that was all about?
1;6;Rick Potion 9;Jessica;Who cares? Just hold me.
1;6;Rick Potion 9;Brad;LET ME GO!!! I LOVE YOU MORTY!
1;6;Rick Potion 9;Jerry;She's gonna be alone with that guy all night.
1;6;Rick Potion 9;Summer;Yeah, Dad, digging around the inside of horses. It's not a very romantic setting.
1;6;Rick Potion 9;Rick;Well, Summer, there's always the possibility that she made the whole work thing up. Maybe Davin's digging around in her insides.
1;6;Rick Potion 9;Summer;Grandpa, so gross! You're talking about my mom.
1;6;Rick Potion 9;Rick;Well, she's my daughter, Summer. I outrank you. Or family means nothing, in which case don't play that card.
1;6;Rick Potion 9;Jerry;She's not responding to my texts!
1;6;Rick Potion 9;Summer;Careful, dad. Jealousy turns women off.
1;6;Rick Potion 9;Jerry;Well, isn't that convenient?
1;6;Rick Potion 9;Rick;Not for the men they cheat on, no.
1;6;Rick Potion 9;Jerry;Okay, I'm... going to go out... for some ice cream. And maybe stop by the hospital... to support my wife... with my confidence.
1;6;Rick Potion 9;Summer;God, grandpa, you're such a dick.
1;6;Rick Potion 9;Rick;I'm sorry, Summer. Your opinion means very little to me. How come you're not at this stupid dance everyone loves so much?
1;6;Rick Potion 9;Summer;Screw that. I don't want to get sick. It's flu season.
1;6;Rick Potion 9;Rick;It is?
1;6;Rick Potion 9;Summer;Yeah.
1;6;Rick Potion 9;Rick;Uh-oh.
1;6;Rick Potion 9;Morty;Please just let this work out.
1;6;Rick Potion 9;Jessica;Do it, Morty. Do it. Rip my clothes off and mate with me for life!
1;6;Rick Potion 9;Morty;Um... Can we maybe go somewhere more private? 
1;6;Rick Potion 9;Grace;Jessica, get a hold of yourself! You don't deserve to carry Morty's genes.
1;6;Rick Potion 9;Rapper;I love Morty, and I hope Morty loves me. I'd like to wrap my arms around him, and feel him inside me...
1;6;Rick Potion 9;Morty;Oh, crap.
1;6;Rick Potion 9;All;Morty!
1;6;Rick Potion 9;Rick;Morty, come on! We got to get you out of here. You're not gonna believe this because it usually never happens, but I made a mistake.
1;6;Rick Potion 9;Rick;Come on, Morty. We got to get out of here. Come on.
1;6;Rick Potion 9;Principal Vagina;Morty! Are you okay?
1;6;Rick Potion 9;Morty;I'm fine!
1;6;Rick Potion 9;Principal Vagina;Oh, good. If anything ever happened to you, I would kill myself. I love you bad, mo-mo!
1;6;Rick Potion 9;Mr. Goldenfold;Morty, the principal and I have discussed it, a-a-and we're both insecure enough to agree to a three-way!
1;6;Rick Potion 9;Rick;I didn't realize when I gave you that serum that Jessica had the flu you know, t-t-t-t-t-t-t-that might have been valuable information for me, Morty.
1;6;Rick Potion 9;Morty;What the hell is going on, Rick?
1;6;Rick Potion 9;Rick;What does it look like? T-t-t-the serum is piggybacking on the virus. It's gone airborne, Morty.
1;6;Rick Potion 9;Morty;Oh, crap. What are we gonna do, Rick?
1;6;Rick Potion 9;Rick;It's gonna be fine, Morty, relax. I whipped up an antidote. It's based on praying-mantis DNA. You know, praying mantises are the exact opposite of voles, Morty. I mean, they they mate once, and then they, you know, decapitate the partner. I mean, it's a whole ritual. It's really gruesome and totally opposite. There's no love at all. I-i-i basically mixed this with a more contagious flu virus. It should neutralize the whole thing, Morty. It'll all be over very shortly.
1;6;Rick Potion 9;Rick;Uh, by the way, Morty, I know you didn't ask or anything, but I'm not interested in having sex with you. These serums, they don't work on anybody related to you genetically.
1;6;Rick Potion 9;All;Morty!
1;6;Rick Potion 9;Rick;Okay, well, sometimes, science is more art than science, Morty. A lot of people don't get that.
1;6;Rick Potion 9;Jerry;Come on. Are you kidding me? Hello!
1;6;Rick Potion 9;Mantis Monster;Morty! You're not Morty! Bring us Morty!
1;6;Rick Potion 9;Jerry;Nobody's killing me until after I catch my wife with another man.
1;6;Rick Potion 9;Mantis Monster Newscaster 1;"We interrupt Pregnant Baby"" with breaking news."""
1;6;Rick Potion 9;Summer;Come on.
1;6;Rick Potion 9;Mantis Monster Newscaster 1;This just in Morty Smith's whereabouts are still unknown.
1;6;Rick Potion 9;Summer;What the hell?
1;6;Rick Potion 9;Mantis Monster Newscaster 1;The only thing that is known is... how cute he is.
1;6;Rick Potion 9;Mantis Monster Newscaster 2;I love him so much, I want to make love to him and then eat his head.
1;6;Rick Potion 9;Mantis Monster Newscaster 1;I love him more than you do, Harold!
1;6;Rick Potion 9;Mantis Monster Newscaster 2;You wish, you stupid bitch!
1;6;Rick Potion 9;Mantis Monster Newscaster 1;Morty's mine!
1;6;Rick Potion 9;Mantis Monster Newscaster 2;Morty's mine! Meant to be together!
1;6;Rick Potion 9;Mantis Monster;Where is Morty?
1;6;Rick Potion 9;Morty;Oh, my god, Rick. The whole world is infected!
1;6;Rick Potion 9;Rick;Yeah, it's pretty wild how fast that spread. I've really outdone myself.
1;6;Rick Potion 9;Morty;Outdone yourself?! W-w a-are are you kidding me, Rick? This is not okay! Not only do they all want to have sex with me, but, you know, now they want to eat me afterwards!
1;6;Rick Potion 9;Rick;Yeah, I don't know what I was thinking. Mantises are they opposite of voles? I mean, obviously, DNA's a little more complicated than that. You know what, though, Morty? This right here's gonna do the tRick, baby. It's koala mixed with rattlesnake, chimpanzee, cactus, shark, golden retriever, and just a smidge of dinosaur. Should add up to normal humanity.
1;6;Rick Potion 9;Morty;I don't that doesn't make any sense, Rick. How does that add up to normal humanity?
1;6;Rick Potion 9;Morty;What, Morty, you want me to show you my math? I'm sorry a-are you the scientist or are you the kid that wanted to get laid?
1;6;Rick Potion 9;Davin;Well, I'm glad we saved all those horses, but I'm almost sorry we're finished.
1;6;Rick Potion 9;Beth;Yes, it's satisfying work.
1;6;Rick Potion 9;Davin;Unh-unh-unh, it's, uh it's more than the work. I love being in that sterilized room, sealed off from the world. It's the only time I can really think... and feel.
1;6;Rick Potion 9;Beth;Hmm, uh, what are you doing?
1;6;Rick Potion 9;Davin;I'm playing african dream pop. What do you do after a long night?
1;6;Rick Potion 9;Beth;Oh, ha, um, hey, I b I'd better get going. Um, Jerry's been texting some pretty high-maintenance stuff.
1;6;Rick Potion 9;Davin;Beth...
1;6;Rick Potion 9;Beth;What is it, Davin?
1;6;Rick Potion 9;Davin;Just once, I'd like to know ...w-w-what it was like to give your son a bath.
1;6;Rick Potion 9;Beth;What?!
1;6;Rick Potion 9;Davin;What does Morty's skin smell like? How soft... How soft are his privates?
1;6;Rick Potion 9;Beth;Let go of me, Davin!
1;6;Rick Potion 9;Davin;Take me to Morty. You're not Morty.
1;6;Rick Potion 9;Jerry;No. I'm mr. Crowbar, and this is my friend, who is also a crowbar.
1;6;Rick Potion 9;Davin;That's... stupid.
1;6;Rick Potion 9;Jerry;Yeah? Well, look where being smart got you.
1;6;Rick Potion 9;Beth;Jerry! Thank god!
1;6;Rick Potion 9;Jerry;God? God's turning people into insect monsters, Beth. I'm the one beating them to death. Thank me.
1;6;Rick Potion 9;Beth;Thank you, Jerry. Thank you.
1;6;Rick Potion 9;Rick;Take a good look down there, Morty, and soak it in, because, you know, once I pull this lever, it's all back to normal.
1;6;Rick Potion 9;Morty;Just do it already.
1;6;Rick Potion 9;Rick;Well, technically, Morty, there's no rush. I mean, you know, o-once it's fixed, it's done. It's fixed. You know, we could we could just enjoy it for a little bit. I mean, l-l-l-look at how crazy it is. I mean, Morty, w-w-when's the next time you're gonna see something like this? I mean, soak it in, you know? It's it's pretty neat. It's pretty interesting.
1;6;Rick Potion 9;Morty;That's it, Rick! I'm pulling the lever.
1;6;Rick Potion 9;Rick;W-what do we have here, Morty? Looks like I was right and you were wrong, huh? I-i-i-i-i-i-i bet you feel pretty stupid right about now, huh? I-i-i bet you feel like the world's smallest man that you were doubting me about this whole thing, Morty.
1;6;Rick Potion 9;Morty;Oh, Rick, something's not right.
1;6;Rick Potion 9;Rick;Yeah, you. You're not right ever.
1;6;Rick Potion 9;Morty;No, no! Look, you idiot!
1;6;Rick Potion 9;Rick;Bet you're loving this, Morty. This must be the best day of your life. You get to be the mayor of I told you town. You're welcome.
1;6;Rick Potion 9;Jerry;Hold on. I wish that shotgun was my penis.
1;6;Rick Potion 9;Beth;If it were, you could call me Ernest Hemingway.
1;6;Rick Potion 9;Jerry;I don't get it, and I don't need to.
1;6;Rick Potion 9;Summer;Mom! Dad!
1;6;Rick Potion 9;Jerry;Summer!
1;6;Rick Potion 9;Beth;Summer!
1;6;Rick Potion 9;Jerry;Where's Morty?
1;6;Rick Potion 9;Summer;I don't know. Do you think grandpa Rick had something to do with this?
1;6;Rick Potion 9;Jerry;It's not fair to assume that, Summer.
1;6;Rick Potion 9;Beth;Oh, not fair? Give me a break. He is a selfish, irresponsible ass, and he left my mother. A real man stands by his woman.
1;6;Rick Potion 9;Rick;"Boy, Morty, I really ""Cronenberged"" the world up, didn't i? We got a whole planet of Cronenbergs walking around down there, Morty. A-at least they're not in love with you anymore, though. That's a huge step in the right direction."
1;6;Rick Potion 9;Morty;Oh, my god! It's a living nightmare! How could you be so irresponsible, Rick?
1;6;Rick Potion 9;Rick;Me irresponsible?! You all I wanted you to do was hand me a screwdriver, Morty! You're the one who wanted to be wanted me to buckle down and make you up a... roofie-juice serum so you could roofie that poor girl at your school. I mean, g w-w-w-w-w w are you kidding me, Morty? You're gonna try to take the high road on this one? Y-y-y-y-you're a little creep, Morty. Y-you're a you're you're you're just a little creepy... creep person.
1;6;Rick Potion 9;Morty;All right, fine. I should have just listened to you when you refused to make the serum. I'm willing to accept my part of the blame for this, Rick. But I'll tell you something you know what? You got to accept your part of the blame! I'm not the one who fouled up the serum! I'm not the one who who who who haphazardly, you know, mixed a bunch of nonsense together and created a bunch of Cronenbergs! You got to fix this, Rick!
1;6;Rick Potion 9;Morty;All right, all right, Morty. You know, w-w-w-we are in a pretty deep hole, here, but I do have one emergency solution that I can use that'll kind of put everything back to normal, relatively speaking. Here, Morty, put this on while I do a little bit of scouting.
1;6;Rick Potion 9;Morty (C-131);Wow, Rick, I got to say you really pulled a rabbit out of your hat this time. I mean, i-i really thought that the whole place was gonna be messed up for good, but here, you did it y-y-you you you figured out that crazy solution, like you always do. Whoo! That's some great luck.
1;6;Rick Potion 9;Rick (C-131);Come on, Morty. Luck had nothing to do with it. I'm great. That's the real reason. Now, Morty, what do you say, buddy? Will you hand me a screwdriver so I can finish my ionic dis-defibulizer?
1;6;Rick Potion 9;Morty (C-131);Sure thing, Rick. Here's a screwdriver.
1;6;Rick Potion 9;Rick (C-131);All right, Morty. Thank you very much. We got one screw turn... and two screw turns... and... 
1;6;Rick Potion 9;Rick;All right, Morty, here we are.
1;6;Rick Potion 9;Morty;Oh, my god, Rick! Is that us?! W-w-w-we're dead! What is going on, Rick? I'm freaking out!
1;6;Rick Potion 9;Rick;Calm down, Morty! Look at me! Calm down, Morty!
1;6;Rick Potion 9;Morty;No, I can't deal with this!
1;6;Rick Potion 9;Rick;Calm yourself, Morty.
1;6;Rick Potion 9;Morty;I can't deal with this, Rick!
1;6;Rick Potion 9;Rick;Calm down, Morty.
1;6;Rick Potion 9;Morty;This can't be real!
1;6;Rick Potion 9;Rick;You got to calm down, Morty.
1;6;Rick Potion 9;Morty;W-w-w-w-we're ripped apart!
1;6;Rick Potion 9;Rick;Shut up and listen to me! It's fine. Everything is fine. There's an infinite number of realities, Morty, and in a few dozen of those, I got lucky and turned everything back to normal. I just had to find one of those realities in which we also happen to both die around this time. Now we can just slip into the place of our dead selves in this reality and everything will be fine. We're not skipping a beat, Morty. Now, help me with these bodies.
1;6;Rick Potion 9;Morty;This is insane.
1;6;Rick Potion 9;Rick;Look, Morty, I'll grab myself, you grab yourself, okay? I mean, t-t-t-that seems fair to me I mean, that seems like a fair way to divvy it up.
1;6;Rick Potion 9;Morty;Rick, what about the reality we left behind?
1;6;Rick Potion 9;Rick;What about the reality where hitler cured cancer, Morty? The answer is don't think about it. It's not like we can do this every week, anyways. We get three or four more of these, tops. Now, pick up your dead self and come on. Haste makes waste. I-i-i don't suppose you've considered this detail, but obviously, if I hadn't screwed up as much as I did, we'd be these guys right now, so, again, you're welcome.
1;6;Rick Potion 9;Jerry;You ever wonder what happened to Rick and Morty?
1;6;Rick Potion 9;Beth;Sometimes. But, I'm ashamed to admit, now that they're gone, I'm finally happy.
1;6;Rick Potion 9;Cronenberg Rick;"Here we are, Cronenberg Morty. A reality where everyone in the world got genetically ""Cronenberged"". We'll fit right in."
1;6;Rick Potion 9;Cronenberg Morty;"Yeah, Cronenberg Rick, but, you know, I'm gonna miss Cronenberg World, because everyone was ""Cronenberged"" all along like us from the beginning, you know? I mean, i-i wish we hadn't genetically ruined Cronenberg World beyond repair like we did, you know, and turned everyone into regular, normal people just walking around."
1;6;Rick Potion 9;Cronenberg Rick;Don't you worry about that sort of thing, Cronenberg Morty. Let's go make ourselves at home, huh?
1;7;Raising Gazorpazorp;Rick;Look, I'm not paying 70 smidgens for a broken defraculator.
1;7;Raising Gazorpazorp;Alien;That is multiphase quantum resonator.
1;7;Raising Gazorpazorp;Rick;Well, does it defraculate?
1;7;Raising Gazorpazorp;Alien;Fuck no.
1;7;Raising Gazorpazorp;Rick;Then -- then -- then it's a broken defraculator.
1;7;Raising Gazorpazorp;Alien;Like you would even know dick about fraculation! Your planet just got cellphones, and the coverage still sucks!
1;7;Raising Gazorpazorp;Rick;Yeah, yeah, and your species eat sulfur. So, let's say 60 smidgens, I tell you what -- I'll do you a favor, I'll throw in a fart.
1;7;Raising Gazorpazorp;Morty;Hey, uh, Rick, um, you think maybe I could get something from this place, like a souvenir, like, just to have ---like, something cool, you know?
1;7;Raising Gazorpazorp;Rick;Not here, Morty, We'll stop somewhere else, because, you know, there's always another pawn shop.
1;7;Raising Gazorpazorp;Morty;Oh, okay. I just, um -- you know, I thought that robot over there looked pretty cool, you know?
1;7;Raising Gazorpazorp;Rick;Oh, it looks cool, huh? That's why you want it?
1;7;Raising Gazorpazorp;Morty;Yeah! You know, I mean, it's different from the stuff on Earth, and, you know, you take me to all these crazy places across the galaxy, and, you know, I don't really have anything to to remember all those trips by, It'd be kind of cool, like a souvenir. You know, like, what if you passed away or died or something? I wouldn't even have anything to remember all the cool stuff we did, you know?
1;7;Raising Gazorpazorp;Rick;Okay, 60 for the resonator, and my grandson wants the sex robot.
1;7;Raising Gazorpazorp;Summer;So, we're just going to pretend this isn't happening? I'm not saying that's a bad idea -- just asking.
1;7;Raising Gazorpazorp;Jerry;Rick, why would you let Morty bring that thing into our house?!
1;7;Raising Gazorpazorp;Rick;I don't know. What do you want from me? He thi-- he thou-- he thou-- he th-- he thought it looked cool. You know what I mean?
1;7;Raising Gazorpazorp;Morty;Whew! Ahh, all right. Back to -- back to -- b-back upstairs.
1;7;Raising Gazorpazorp;Jerry;Well, I'm intervening.
1;7;Raising Gazorpazorp;Beth;"Intervening with puberty? You'll turn him into Ralph Fiennes in ""Red Dragon"". He's at that age. Let's just be proud of him."""
1;7;Raising Gazorpazorp;Summer;Jesus, Did I really set the bar that low?
1;7;Raising Gazorpazorp;Morty;Um, Rick, could you come with me, please -- q-quickly?
1;7;Raising Gazorpazorp;Beth;Okay, now if we hear squeaking, we intervene.
1;7;Raising Gazorpazorp;Rick;Where's the sex robot, Morty?
1;7;Raising Gazorpazorp;Morty;That is Gwendolyn -- I-I mean, the robot! She started beeping and then transformed and tried to fly away!
1;7;Raising Gazorpazorp;Rick;Strange -- that's usually the man's job. You know what I'm talking about, Morty? Wubba-lubba-dub-dub! Morty that's my catchphrase, remember? Remember -- remember how I -- how I cemented that catchphrase? All right, All right, seriously, though, let me grab this thing. Come on, you rascal.
1;7;Raising Gazorpazorp;Beth;Okay, unacceptable! Oh.
1;7;Raising Gazorpazorp;Jerry;What is going on?
1;7;Raising Gazorpazorp;Rick;All right, Uh-oh.
1;7;Raising Gazorpazorp;Beth;"Uh-oh""? What is that?!"""
1;7;Raising Gazorpazorp;Rick;Hmm, I think Morty's robot was designed for more than long weekends. Genetic compiler, incubation chamber, Yep, This here's some kind of baby maker, and that there's half Morty, half Who -- who knows wh-what? It's my bad, guys, I'll -- I'll take care of it.
1;7;Raising Gazorpazorp;Summer;Grandpa Rick, no, no!
1;7;Raising Gazorpazorp;Jerry;Whoa, whoa, whoa!
1;7;Raising Gazorpazorp;Beth;Dad, What do you think you're doing?!
1;7;Raising Gazorpazorp;Rick;Hey, listen -- you guys quarantined the house when Summer brought olives back from Mexico. I mean, this thing could grow to the size of Delaware. I mean, it might eat brains and exhale space aids. We got to be careful.
1;7;Raising Gazorpazorp;Morty;I lost the chance to be careful. Rick, I'm a father now! You know, it's time for me to be responsible, Isn't that right...
1;7;Raising Gazorpazorp;Rick;Don't name it.
1;7;Raising Gazorpazorp;Morty;...Morty Jr.?
1;7;Raising Gazorpazorp;Rick;Oh, crap he named it.
1;7;Raising Gazorpazorp;Beth;Well, dad, it's a living thing, and it's half human.
1;7;Raising Gazorpazorp;Jerry;And it was born on American soil, which entitles it to --
1;7;Raising Gazorpazorp;Beth;Jerry, majoring in civics was your mistake. Don't punish us for it.
1;7;Raising Gazorpazorp;Rick;Fine, I'm gonna take this thing to my workshop and do a little bit of investigating. Do not let that thing out of your sight. It looks harmless now, but it could grow into something dangerous.
1;7;Raising Gazorpazorp;Jerry;Like the Insane Clown Posse.
1;7;Raising Gazorpazorp;Rick;Yeah, Good one, Jerry. 2003 just called. It wants its easy target back.
1;7;Raising Gazorpazorp;Morty;Ohh, He's like a little me! Y-you don't think he'll turn into a monster... do you?
1;7;Raising Gazorpazorp;Beth;They always do.
1;7;Raising Gazorpazorp;Jerry;"Hey, uh, 1995 called! They want their Certain year called wanting its 'blank' back"" Formula back!"""
1;7;Raising Gazorpazorp;Beth;Why, Jerry? Why expend the effort?
1;7;Raising Gazorpazorp;Jerry;Life is effort, and I'll stop when I die!
1;7;Raising Gazorpazorp;Rick;Out.
1;7;Raising Gazorpazorp;Summer;Whatcha doin'?
1;7;Raising Gazorpazorp;Rick;Well, I can't solve the problem my way, thanks to your family's primitive biological hang-ups. Gross, I might have just touched one of Morty's loads. But maybe I can find suitable parents for Morty Jr, on this robot's home world, which is... Gazorpazorp, in the Andromeda system. Scoot, Summer.
1;7;Raising Gazorpazorp;Summer;Don't you need a new companion now that Morty's in the family way?
1;7;Raising Gazorpazorp;Rick;I don't do adventures with chicks, Summer.
1;7;Raising Gazorpazorp;Summer;Oh, right -- because there's something about having a wiener that would make me better at walking through a hole? Aaaaaaaaaaaaah!
1;7;Raising Gazorpazorp;Rick;Oh, crap.
1;7;Raising Gazorpazorp;Summer;Grandpa Rick! Ugh! Help! Help! Aah! Aah! Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah! Grandpa Rick!
1;7;Raising Gazorpazorp;Rick;Still think it's a good idea to go through holes without a wiener?
1;7;Raising Gazorpazorp;Summer;I want to go home.
1;7;Raising Gazorpazorp;Rick;Yeah, no duh.
1;7;Raising Gazorpazorp;Summer;Ugh!
1;7;Raising Gazorpazorp;Rick;Great, now I have to take over a whole planet because of your stupid boobs.
1;7;Raising Gazorpazorp;Jerry;You're doing great Morty.
1;7;Raising Gazorpazorp;Morty;Really? You think? I mean, I'm not doing much of anything. What do I do if it cries?
1;7;Raising Gazorpazorp;Beth;Then you put it down and let it cry itself out.
1;7;Raising Gazorpazorp;Jerry;Yeah, right. We tried that technique on Summer, and she's gonna end up stripping, Isn't she? Yes, she is. She's gonna strip for attention because she was denied it.
1;7;Raising Gazorpazorp;Beth;Stop filling it with your own insecurity. You're gonna turn it into Morty -- uh, mm -- more -- more -- more -- more of you.
1;7;Raising Gazorpazorp;Jerry;Well, we can't all be raised like reptiles by a mentally ill scientist. What the -- aah! Aah!
1;7;Raising Gazorpazorp;Beth;Listen to me. I am not rewarding this behavior.
1;7;Raising Gazorpazorp;Morty;Knock it off, both of you! G-give me him! Give me my baby! You're both nuts! I'm gonna raise Morty Jr, myself!
1;7;Raising Gazorpazorp;Jerry;Oh, you are going to ruin that kid, Morty.
1;7;Raising Gazorpazorp;Beth;At least we can agree on that.
1;7;Raising Gazorpazorp;Rick;Thanks, dum-dum. I said, Thanks
1;7;Raising Gazorpazorp;Rick;Summer, put your burka on!
1;7;Raising Gazorpazorp;Summer;That burka is a human-rights violation, and I spent a lot on this top.
1;7;Raising Gazorpazorp;Rick;"Look, I'm trying to repair a p-portal gun with a bunch of sex-doll parts, and I have to do it one-handed to keep these Belushis"" from carting you off. The least you could do is be ashamed of your gender."
1;7;Raising Gazorpazorp;Summer;Ugh, What's the deal with this place? Why is it such a sausage planet, and how did such backward idiots invent robots?
1;7;Raising Gazorpazorp;Rick;Obviously, at some point, the Gazorpians became so evolved that they replaced females with birthing machines. The resultant lack of distraction and hen-pecking allowed them to focus entirely on war, so they bombed themselves back to the stone age, and now they just fight with each other over fake pussy with sticks and rocks all day long.
1;7;Raising Gazorpazorp;Summer;You think it's efficient to get rid of women?
1;7;Raising Gazorpazorp;Rick;You ever see a line for the men's room? Are you hear-- do you li-- do you hear me, Summer?
1;7;Raising Gazorpazorp;Spaceship;Droppin' loads! Droppin' loads! Droppin' loads!
1;7;Raising Gazorpazorp;Rick;The plot thickens. Uh, you might want to cover your eyes, Summer.
1;7;Raising Gazorpazorp;Summer;Yeah, like it was my dream to watch.
1;7;Raising Gazorpazorp;Spaceship;Yeah, baby!
1;7;Raising Gazorpazorp;Rick;Summer, grab -- grab hold.
1;7;Raising Gazorpazorp;Spaceship;Yeah, baby!
1;7;Raising Gazorpazorp;Rick;Aaaah!
1;7;Raising Gazorpazorp;Summer;Grandpa Rick, where are we going?
1;7;Raising Gazorpazorp;Rick;Well, obviously, Summer, it appears the lower tier of this society is being manipulated through sex and advanced technology by a hidden ruling class. Sound familiar?
1;7;Raising Gazorpazorp;Summer;Ticketmaster...
1;7;Raising Gazorpazorp;Rick;"Oh, there -- there we go, Summer. Hey -- hey, brother. Hey, bro! Nice racket you got going on here. Listen, I'm Rick Sanchez from Earth dimension C-137. Don't mean you any harm. Coming in peace. It's all cool in the, uh -- Good in the neighborhood"" is what I was trying to come -- is what I meant. Oh"
1;7;Raising Gazorpazorp;Gazorpian;Silence!
1;7;Raising Gazorpazorp;Gazorpian;Your slave is ill-mannered.
1;7;Raising Gazorpazorp;Summer;My slave?
1;7;Raising Gazorpazorp;Gazorpian;We assume you are from a more primitive world, where men are still permitted to be servants. If he is a rogue male, tell us now and we will kill him.
1;7;Raising Gazorpazorp;Summer;He's my slave. He's my slave, he's definitely my slave.
1;7;Raising Gazorpazorp;Rick;"Ugh! Ohh! Oh-ho-ho! Oh, boy, What's the opposite of Wubba-lubba-dub-dubs""? Am I right, ladies and gentlemen? Are you guys kidding me?"
1;7;Raising Gazorpazorp;Morty;Oh, Morty Jr.! you're gonna be a special little guy, aren't you? You -- oh, yeah. You're my special little guy. Ohh! Ohh! Ha ha!
1;7;Raising Gazorpazorp;Morty Jr.;Da.
1;7;Raising Gazorpazorp;Morty;"What was that, Morty Jr.? Were you gonna say, ""Dada""? Say ""Dada""!"
1;7;Raising Gazorpazorp;Morty Jr.;Death!
1;7;Raising Gazorpazorp;Morty;"""Dada."""
1;7;Raising Gazorpazorp;Morty Jr.;Damnation!
1;7;Raising Gazorpazorp;Morty;"Um... ""Dada""?"
1;7;Raising Gazorpazorp;Morty Jr.;Destruction, Domination.
1;7;Raising Gazorpazorp;Jerry;Nice.
1;7;Raising Gazorpazorp;Gazorpian PA System;"The spider in sector ""C"" is still alive. Plan your route accordingly and expect delays. We're not telling you what to do, we're just sharing how we feel. And now weather -- is anyone else cold, or is it just me?"
1;7;Raising Gazorpazorp;Mar-sha;I am Mar-sha, ruler of Gazorpazorp. I am here if you need to talk.
1;7;Raising Gazorpazorp;Summer;What is this place?
1;7;Raising Gazorpazorp;Mar-sha;Paradise. We built it during the great passive-aggression, when the females separated from the males due to their increasingly destructive behavior. I am here if you need to talk.
1;7;Raising Gazorpazorp;Gazorpian;I am here if you need to talk.
1;7;Raising Gazorpazorp;Mar-sha;From here, we dispense mechanical surrogates to maintain our population. Fertilized surrogates are returned here to our nursery. The females are placed into educational programs where they can discover a service to our paradise that fulfills them most. Males....they get to play outside.
1;7;Raising Gazorpazorp;Summer;That was just a baby.
1;7;Raising Gazorpazorp;Gazorpian;And within a day, he'll be an adult male Gazorpian -- one of the most aggressively violent creatures in the universe.
1;7;Raising Gazorpazorp;Rick;Wait a minute, We're here because a male Gazorpian was born on our planet.
1;7;Raising Gazorpazorp;Summer;You speak when you're spoken to, ding-a-ling! It's true, though -- one of your babies was born on Earth.
1;7;Raising Gazorpazorp;Mar-sha;Are you the ruler of this Earth?
1;7;Raising Gazorpazorp;Summer;How did you know?
1;7;Raising Gazorpazorp;Mar-sha;The quality of your top.
1;7;Raising Gazorpazorp;Summer;Do you love it?
1;7;Raising Gazorpazorp;Mar-sha;I love it.
1;7;Raising Gazorpazorp;Gazorpian;I'm here if you need to talk.
1;7;Raising Gazorpazorp;Mar-sha;I'm here if you need to talk.
1;7;Raising Gazorpazorp;Summer;I'm here if you need to talk.
1;7;Raising Gazorpazorp;Mar-sha;If the Gazorpian is male, your Earth is in grave danger. We will give you passage back home so it can be terminated. But first, Mojitos!
1;7;Raising Gazorpazorp;Rick;We don't have time for Mojitos.
1;7;Raising Gazorpazorp;Summer;You are insulting them!
1;7;Raising Gazorpazorp;Rick;I don't care, Summer! This place is the worst! I want to go home!
1;7;Raising Gazorpazorp;Summer;Well, it really doesn't matter what you want, because this is a sane place where women rule.
1;7;Raising Gazorpazorp;Rick;Yeah, You know what I have to say about that?
1;7;Raising Gazorpazorp;Gazorpians;I cannot believe my ears!
1;7;Raising Gazorpazorp;Rick;Whoo, boy! Who let the frogs out, huh?
1;7;Raising Gazorpazorp;Summer;Grandpa!
1;7;Raising Gazorpazorp;Mar-sha;Grandpa?
1;7;Raising Gazorpazorp;Gazorpian 1;That sounds patriarchal!
1;7;Raising Gazorpazorp;Gazorpian 2;"It means ""Father of fathers."""
1;7;Raising Gazorpazorp;Mar-sha;Then this one is not your slave, and your Earth is yet another planet dominated by men.
1;7;Raising Gazorpazorp;Rick;It's not dominated by us, okay? On Earth, men and women are equals.
1;7;Raising Gazorpazorp;Summer;Equals?! We make 70% of your salary for the same job!
1;7;Raising Gazorpazorp;Gazorpian 2;Seize them!
1;7;Raising Gazorpazorp;Rick;Whoa! Was this really the time to make that point, Summer?
1;7;Raising Gazorpazorp;Morty Jr.;This is for you, daddy.
1;7;Raising Gazorpazorp;Morty;Oh, man! Um, okay. Listen to me, Morty Jr., I've got to tell you something very important, okay? Killing is bad -- bad!
1;7;Raising Gazorpazorp;Morty Jr.;You're silly, daddy.
1;7;Raising Gazorpazorp;Morty;No, Morty Jr., I'm being serious, okay? You need to put your energy into something else. I mean, what about dancing? Would you like to learn how to dance?
1;7;Raising Gazorpazorp;Morty Jr.;I'd like to dance -- on the graves of my enemies.
1;7;Raising Gazorpazorp;Morty;Ohh! No, Morty Jr.!
1;7;Raising Gazorpazorp;Morty Jr.;Daddy, can I go outside?
1;7;Raising Gazorpazorp;Morty;No! Absolutely not! 
1;7;Raising Gazorpazorp;Morty Jr.;But that's where all the people and the animals are.
1;7;Raising Gazorpazorp;Morty;Yeah, but you can't go out there because the -- the air is poisonous for you! You will die -- you'll die instantly if you ever leave this house! You hear me?
1;7;Raising Gazorpazorp;Morty Jr.;For real?
1;7;Raising Gazorpazorp;Morty;For real times a million, buddy. So, let's just stay inside, and, you know, let's try dancing, right? Look at me, Yay! Look, We're gonna dance, come on. Join -- dance with me here. We love to dance.
1;7;Raising Gazorpazorp;Morty Jr.;Why do we love to dance?
1;7;Raising Gazorpazorp;Morty;Because I said so!
1;7;Raising Gazorpazorp;Beth;Nice.
1;7;Raising Gazorpazorp;Jerry;Nice.
1;7;Raising Gazorpazorp;Gazorpian;So, what are you in for?
1;7;Raising Gazorpazorp;Rick;Because I got -- I got a big, you know, penis between my legs. What -- what -- what are you in for?
1;7;Raising Gazorpazorp;Gazorpian;The worst crime a female can commit.
1;7;Raising Gazorpazorp;Gazorpian Judge;Veronica Ann Bennett. I find you guilty of having bad bangs.
1;7;Raising Gazorpazorp;Gazorpian 2;You ever notice the ones with bad bangs always have three names?
1;7;Raising Gazorpazorp;Gazorpian Judge;You are hereby sentenced to the silent treatment!
1;7;Raising Gazorpazorp;Rick;Pfft! This is gonna be cake. 
1;7;Raising Gazorpazorp;Gazorpian;No, Jackie!
1;7;Raising Gazorpazorp;Gazorpian Judge;Rick and Summer of Earth, for the crimes of treason against womankind and for creating the sound of which we do not speak because it does not exist, you are hereby sentenced to --
1;7;Raising Gazorpazorp;Rick;What, what, what -- a night on the couch?
1;7;Raising Gazorpazorp;Gazorpian Judge;...death.
1;7;Raising Gazorpazorp;Rick;Ooh, gerp.
1;7;Raising Gazorpazorp;Summer;I hate you so much right now.
1;7;Raising Gazorpazorp;Mar-sha;This will be the first instance of capital punishment in our society in 500 years due to our awesomeness, so we are forced to improvise. We placed a large boulder on that ledge.
1;7;Raising Gazorpazorp;Rick;Holy shit! Y-y-you're gonna crush us with a boulder?!
1;7;Raising Gazorpazorp;Mar-sha;No! Stop interrupting! The boulder falls onto a lever that will launch knives.
1;7;Raising Gazorpazorp;Rick;What? Just give me a gun, I'll kill myself.
1;7;Raising Gazorpazorp;Mar-sha;Stop interrupting! The knives will -- fine! You were right the first time, okay? The boulder crushes you. I just didn't want to admit you were right. Happy?
1;7;Raising Gazorpazorp;Gazorpian 1;No, just ignore them. Ignore them.
1;7;Raising Gazorpazorp;Mar-sha;Such an asshole.
1;7;Raising Gazorpazorp;Rick;Look, I'm sorry, Summer. I feel bad that I let you drag us into this. I wish I could have been a better grandpa to you, and, you know, for what it's worth, that is a really nice, cute top that you're wearing there.
1;7;Raising Gazorpazorp;Summer;Top, My top! My top -- the same top you complimented earlier! Look -- look at the tag. Read it.
1;7;Raising Gazorpazorp;Gazorpian 2;"It says, ""Marc Jacobs""."
1;7;Raising Gazorpazorp;Mar-sha;Marc? Jacob? These are names of the penis.
1;7;Raising Gazorpazorp;Summer;Yes. An Earth man made this top. Maybe on your planet, separation of the genders is the right thing to do, but on Earth, a certain percentage of our males are born gay, which is why my clothes are better than all of yours.
1;7;Raising Gazorpazorp;Gazorpian 1;A man made something fashionable?
1;7;Raising Gazorpazorp;Mar-sha;It's true, and sometimes the truth hurts, but it must be accepted, like if I told you that you're using the wrong color foundation for your skin and it ends at your neck, making you look like a party clown.
1;7;Raising Gazorpazorp;Summer;Okay, ouch, noted. But the fact remains if you impose Gazorpazorp's laws on earth, you're no better than the men whose farts shall remain unspoken. And if you think my top is cute, you cannot execute.
1;7;Raising Gazorpazorp;Mar-sha;Very well, Give the Earth people a spacecraft so they may head back to their weird planet, where women are kind of equal but not really.
1;7;Raising Gazorpazorp;Rick;Good job, Summer, and thanks, girls. You know, you girls are really something, I'll tell you that, you know, when we first got there, I was like --
1;7;Raising Gazorpazorp;Mar-sha;Give them a ship now!
1;7;Raising Gazorpazorp;Morty;Morty Jr.! Smoking?! That is not okay!
1;7;Raising Gazorpazorp;Morty Jr.;What are you gonna do -- ground me? I can't go outside anyway!
1;7;Raising Gazorpazorp;Morty;So what?! You could do things inside! You could play guitar, you could masturbate...
1;7;Raising Gazorpazorp;Morty Jr.;I don't want to masturbate! I want to conquer the planet!
1;7;Raising Gazorpazorp;Morty;Oh, here we go again! You know, who do you think is gonna love you if you conquer the planet, Morty Jr.?!
1;7;Raising Gazorpazorp;Morty Jr.;Love -- that's all you care about! What about weapons?! What about domination of the enemy?!
1;7;Raising Gazorpazorp;Morty;All right, that's it -- no more History Channel! This TV is for cartoons and video games only!
1;7;Raising Gazorpazorp;Morty Jr.;I hate video games!
1;7;Raising Gazorpazorp;Morty;You take that back! Give it to me! Ugh!
1;7;Raising Gazorpazorp;Morty;I-I-I didn't mean -- I didn't mean that. I didn't mean to do that. I'm sorry.
1;7;Raising Gazorpazorp;Morty Jr.;I can't take this anymore! I'd rather breathe poison than live another minute with you!
1;7;Raising Gazorpazorp;Morty;No! No, no, no! Stop!
1;7;Raising Gazorpazorp;Morty Jr.;My life has been a lie! God is dead! The government's lame! Thanksgiving is about killing Indians! Jesus wasn't born on Christmas! They moved the date! It was a pagan holiday!
1;7;Raising Gazorpazorp;Morty;Oh, dad!
1;7;Raising Gazorpazorp;Jerry;Yes, Morty?
1;7;Raising Gazorpazorp;Morty;My son is gonna take over the planet, and I am too young to drive! Can you help me get him back?!
1;7;Raising Gazorpazorp;Jerry;"I suppose, Morty. I suppose. But first, a deep sip from a very tall glass of ""I told you so""."
1;7;Raising Gazorpazorp;Morty;Oh, my god! Please, dad! Come on!
1;7;Raising Gazorpazorp;Morty;Dad, there he is!
1;7;Raising Gazorpazorp;Jerry;Oh, god, Hey, stop that!
1;7;Raising Gazorpazorp;Morty;Oh, my god! Oh, my god! Dad!
1;7;Raising Gazorpazorp;Morty;Morty Jr., no! It's me! It's dad. It's okay! Put the car down, Morty Jr. No! No! Wh-where's your hands? Where's your hands?
1;7;Raising Gazorpazorp;Jerry;My car!
1;7;Raising Gazorpazorp;Morty Jr.;And that's how we play handy hands!
1;7;Raising Gazorpazorp;Rick;Out of the -- out of the way, Morty!
1;7;Raising Gazorpazorp;Morty;No!
1;7;Raising Gazorpazorp;Rick;Morty, that's one of the most violently aggressive creatures in the universe!
1;7;Raising Gazorpazorp;Morty;He's my son! And if you hurt him, you'll have to kill me, Rick!
1;7;Raising Gazorpazorp;Morty Jr.;Dad, I'm so confused!
1;7;Raising Gazorpazorp;Morty;I know, Morty Jr., I'm sorry. I ended up lying to you and yelling at you just like my parents did to me. You know, parents are just kids having kids. One minute, you like how a shiny robot looks. The next minute, you're in a fist fight with your alien son.
1;7;Raising Gazorpazorp;Morty Jr.;I'm an alien?
1;7;Raising Gazorpazorp;Morty;We all have bad impulses, bad thoughts. We just have to learn to channel them into something constructive.
1;7;Raising Gazorpazorp;Morty Jr.;But I want to murder everyone I see!
1;7;Raising Gazorpazorp;Morty;Well, you know, I mean, maybe there's a job out there for people that feel that way.
1;7;Raising Gazorpazorp;Brad Anderson;"Actually, there is. Hi, I'm Brad Anderson, creator of the nationally syndicated comic strip Marmaduke"". You should consider being a creative. I'm haunted by uncontrollable thoughts of mutilations and sexual assaults on a near daily basis. But"
1;7;Raising Gazorpazorp;Morty;"Oh, Wow. Huh, I never got that impression from reading Marmaduke""."""
1;7;Raising Gazorpazorp;Brad Anderson;Well, did you get the impression I was trying to make you laugh?
1;7;Raising Gazorpazorp;Jerry;Tell me that wasn't Brad Anderson?
1;7;Raising Gazorpazorp;Morty;Aw, see? You hear that, Morty Jr.? Maybe you could try being a creative of some kind.
1;7;Raising Gazorpazorp;Morty Jr.;Maybe! I always have sort of wanted to see my face on the back of a novel. I mean, what I really want to do is slit people's throats, but beyond that...
1;7;Raising Gazorpazorp;Morty;I know you can do it, son.
1;7;Raising Gazorpazorp;Morty Jr.;I think it's time I get a place of my own. I promise I'll call you every day, or if I need money or a place to do laundry.
1;7;Raising Gazorpazorp;Morty;Aaaaaaah!
1;7;Raising Gazorpazorp;Jerry;So, I assume this novel your son writes is gonna pay for my rear axle?
1;7;Raising Gazorpazorp;Rick;Isn't it interesting, Summer, that after all that stuff we just did, nothing really mattered and there was no point to it? Kind of makes you wonder, huh -- about nothing?
1;7;Raising Gazorpazorp;Summer;Are you sure it doesn't make you re-evaluate your policy about taking girls on adventures?
1;7;Raising Gazorpazorp;Rick;No, I'd say, given what we've been through, that I was right the whole time and any epiphanies about gender politics were a projection of your feminine insecurity. But, hey, why don't you have a pink spaceship? Go ride around and have a jolly old time. Maybe that'll shut you up.
1;7;Raising Gazorpazorp;Beth;Dad? Summer? Where were you guys this whole time?
1;7;Raising Gazorpazorp;Summer;On Gazorpazorp. Where were you?
1;7;Raising Gazorpazorp;Beth;I was reading a newspaper.
1;7;Raising Gazorpazorp;Rick;Oh, that's interesting, Beth. You know, it's funny, I-I-I heard about a little bit of news myself. Take a look. T-take a listen.
1;7;Raising Gazorpazorp;Rick;Wubba-lubba-dub-dubs! This this world still got a -- it's still got a chance! Yeah! Ha ha! See you -- see you guys next week! See everybody next week!
1;7;Raising Gazorpazorp;Interviewer;Mortimer Smith Jr., New York Times bestselling author, your book is about innocence, the definition of it, and, inevitably, its impossibility. Is it autobiographical?
1;7;Raising Gazorpazorp;Morty Jr.;Certainly. I mean, all writing is, in my opinion. But, uh -- my, um... My father kept me locked in the house until I was a teenager, and there was violence and, uh, threats of poison gas -- but also dancing.
1;7;Raising Gazorpazorp;Interviewer;"But you persevered, and created this masterpiece from your suffering. Smith Jr's mind-bending novel,  ""My Horrible Father"", in every store and on everyone's mind. Pick it up. We'll be right back."
1;7;Raising Gazorpazorp;Beth;It's a thankless job, Morty. You did the best you could.
1;7;Raising Gazorpazorp;Morty;I hope he's eating enough.
1;8;Rixty Minutes;Bachelor;Cynthia...
1;8;Rixty Minutes;Jerry;Oh, my God! No, no..!
1;8;Rixty Minutes;Summer;I told you!
1;8;Rixty Minutes;Beth;Hold on.
1;8;Rixty Minutes;Bachelor;Will you please... NOT marry me-- I choose Veronica.
1;8;Rixty Minutes;Summer;What?
1;8;Rixty Minutes;Jerry;Yes!
1;8;Rixty Minutes;Beth;Called it.
1;8;Rixty Minutes;Summer;Why would he choose Veronica?
1;8;Rixty Minutes;Jerry;Because he loves her?
1;8;Rixty Minutes;Rick;Well if it's any consolation, Summer, none of it mattered, and the entire show is stupid.
1;8;Rixty Minutes;Jerry;"Okay, I've got an idea, Rick. You show us your concept of good TV"""
1;8;Rixty Minutes;Rick ;I thought you'd never ask.
1;8;Rixty Minutes;Jerry;Hey!
1;8;Rixty Minutes;Morty;Oh, cool! Is that crystallized Zanthonite? It conducts electrons across dimensions.
1;8;Rixty Minutes;Rick;20% accurate, as usual, Morty. The important thing being I just upgraded our cable package with programming from every conceivable reality.
1;8;Rixty Minutes;Jerry;Wait, does that mean we get Showtime Extreme?
1;8;Rixty Minutes;Rick;How about Showtime Extreme in a world where man evolved from corn?
1;8;Rixty Minutes;Corn Man 1;We're not so different. We're both corn of action.
1;8;Rixty Minutes;Corn Man 2;Yeah... But one of us is dead corn!
1;8;Rixty Minutes;Summer;Bor-ing.
1;8;Rixty Minutes;Rick;Summer, you just spent three months watching a man choose a fake wife.
1;8;Rixty Minutes;Jerry;So, what, It'd be better if the people were corn?
1;8;Rixty Minutes;Rick;Jerry, you don't get it. This is infinite TV, from infinite universes. Look.
1;8;Rixty Minutes;Glenn;This shit is delicious.
1;8;Rixty Minutes;Rick;A movie about a guy eating shit. A violent Antiques Show...
1;8;Rixty Minutes;Letterman;It's a pleasure to have you.
1;8;Rixty Minutes;Famous Jerry;The pleasure's all mine.
1;8;Rixty Minutes;Rick;Letterman from a time line where Jerry's famous.
1;8;Rixty Minutes;Jerry;Wait!
1;8;Rixty Minutes;Beth;What in the hell?
1;8;Rixty Minutes;Rick;I agree. Where's this going?
1;8;Rixty Minutes;Jerry;No, the other thing! Go back!
1;8;Rixty Minutes;Rick;Really? All right, fine.
1;8;Rixty Minutes;Woman;Glenn, this is a court order. It says you can't eat shit anymore.
1;8;Rixty Minutes;Rick;All right, Jerry, when you're right, you're right. Now I'm hooked.

1;8;Rixty Minutes;Host in Trenchcoat;And now, another Quick Mystery.
1;8;Rixty Minutes;Cop;I just want to know who could've done something like this. It's a travesty!
1;8;Rixty Minutes;Killer 1;I did. See this knife and all the blood on it? Here's my fingerprints.
1;8;Rixty Minutes;Judge;Guilty! I sentence you to life in prison.
1;8;Rixty Minutes;Host in Trenchcoat;Here's another Quick Mystery.

1;8;Rixty Minutes;Host in Trenchcoat;Wow, that one was really quick, wasn't it?
1;8;Rixty Minutes;Rick;Now who wants to watch random, crazy TV shows from different dimensions, a-a-and then who wants to narcissistically obsess about their alternate self?
1;8;Rixty Minutes;Beth;Narcissism! 
1;8;Rixty Minutes;Summer;The narcisstic stuff! 
1;8;Rixty Minutes;Jerry;I want to obsess about myself.
1;8;Rixty Minutes;Rick;Here. These scan your retinas, and let you view parallel time lines through genetically matching versions of your eyes. Go fetch!
1;8;Rixty Minutes;Beth;Yes! This is so cool! Ladies First!
1;8;Rixty Minutes;Rick;I'm proud of you, Morty.
1;8;Rixty Minutes;Morty;Hey man, I don't give a crap about myself, Rick. Let's watch some crazy stuff, yo!
1;8;Rixty Minutes;Ants-In-My-Eyes Johnson;I'm Ants-In-My-Eyes Johnson, Here at Ants-in-My-Eyes Johnson's Electronics. I mean, there's so many ants in my eyes! And there's so many TVs, microwaves, radios I think, I can't-- I'm not 100% sure what we have here in stock, because I can't see anything. Our prices, I hope, aren't too low! Check out this refrigerator! Only $200! What about this microwave? Only $100! That's fair! I'm Ants-in-My-Eyes Johnson! Everything's black, I can't see a thing! And also I can't feel anything either-- did I mention that? But that's not as catchy as having ants in your eyes. So that always goes, you know, off by the wayside. I can't feel. It's a very rare disease. All my-- All my nerves, they don't allow for the sensation of touch. So I never know what's going on. Am I standing? Sitting? I don't know.
1;8;Rixty Minutes;Beth;Are we sure we want to do this? Look at our own alternate lives?
1;8;Rixty Minutes;Jerry;You're right. Maybe we should just play Yahtzee-- Give me those!
1;8;Rixty Minutes;Beth;What do you see?
1;8;Rixty Minutes;Jerry;Whiteness... Pure whiteness.
1;8;Rixty Minutes;Johnny Depp;You're my best friend, Jerry Smith. I love doing cocaine with you.
1;8;Rixty Minutes;Jerry;Whoa! I love doing cocaine with you too, Johnny Depp!
1;8;Rixty Minutes;Beth;Haven't we spent enough time on you? I'm performing surgery... but not on a horse, on a human!
1;8;Rixty Minutes;Jerry;That's great, Beth! You always wanted to be a real surgeon.
1;8;Rixty Minutes;Beth;I am a real surgeon.
1;8;Rixty Minutes;Jerry;Ahh, uh-- Summer's turn!
1;8;Rixty Minutes;Summer;Finally! I don't see anything.
1;8;Rixty Minutes;Beth;Well, you should select a different timeline, I mean, if your father and I achieved our dreams, there's a chance you weren't even born-- That came out wrong, that came out very wrong.
1;8;Rixty Minutes;Summer;Fine, I'll find a world where you bothered to have me. We're playing Yahtzee.
1;8;Rixty Minutes;Beth;Yahtzee's fun. We love Yahtzee.
1;8;Rixty Minutes;Jerry;It's a fun game for fun families! Hey, could I get those goggles back for a second?
1;8;Rixty Minutes;Announcer;It's a 45 horsepower with anti-lock brakes, and it's the official car of Mr. Sneezy 3D. It's the brand-new Sneezy XL. The horn when you honk it makes a sneeze noise. It's polite, it's right, and it's Sneezy Deezy Mc-fucking Deluxe.
1;8;Rixty Minutes;Mr. Sneezy 3D;Oh, I'm Mr. Sneezy! Achoo!
1;8;Rixty Minutes;Morty;Huh, seems like TV from other dimensions has a somewhat looser feel to it.
1;8;Rixty Minutes;Rick;Yeah, it's got an almost improvisational tone.
1;8;Rixty Minutes;Announcer;It's in theaters now! Coming this summer,Two brothers. In a van. And then a meteor hit. And they ran as fast as they could, from giant cat monsters. And then a giant tornado came. And that's when things got knocked into 12th gear. A Mexican armada shows up. With weapons made from Two--tomatoes. And you better bet your bottom dollar that these two brothers know how to handle business. In,Alien Invasion Tomato Monster Mexican Armada Brothers, Who Are Just Regular Brothers, Running In a Van From an Asteroid and All Sorts of Things THE MOVIE! Hold on, there's more! Old women are coming, and they're also in the movie, and they're gonna come, and cross-attack these two brothers. But let's get back to the brothers, because they're-- they have a strong bond. You don't want to know about it here, but I'll tell you one thing,The moon, it comes crashing into Earth. And what do you do then? It's two brothers and--and th-they're - It's called Two Brothers. Two brothers! It's just called Two Brothers.
1;8;Rixty Minutes;Beth;Holy crap, I am winning a Nobel Prize.
1;8;Rixty Minutes;Jerry;Come on! Time's up! I'm taming a lion! No, wait, uhh there are film cameras. I might be a lion-tamer in a movie. You get the idea. I work with lions.
1;8;Rixty Minutes;Summer;Ooh, we're not playing Yahtzee, we're playing Chutes and Ladders. It seems like when I exist, life gets a little more, I don't know, predictable?
1;8;Rixty Minutes;Beth;When two people create a life together, they set aside their previous lives as individuals.
1;8;Rixty Minutes;Jerry;Gimme a break! We're not heroes for having unprotected sex on prom night.
1;8;Rixty Minutes;Beth;Oh, I get it. Now that you know you could have had it better, you resent me for holding you back.
1;8;Rixty Minutes;Jerry;Well now that we know you think the tables are turning, we know you thought there were unturned tables!
1;8;Rixty Minutes;Beth;What are you talking about?
1;8;Rixty Minutes;Jerry;"All this time, you've been thinking, What if that loser Jerry hadn't talked me out of the abortion?"""""
1;8;Rixty Minutes;Summer;Um--
1;8;Rixty Minutes;Jerry;Well now you know,you'd be a doctor. Whoop-dee-doo. You'd also be drinking wine, alone in a house full of exotic birds. And I'd be on DiCaprio's yacht-- banging Kristen Stewart!
1;8;Rixty Minutes;Summer;You thought about getting an abortion?
1;8;Rixty Minutes;Beth;Everyone thinks about it. Obviously, I'm the version of me that didn't do it. So you're welcome.
1;8;Rixty Minutes;Jerry;Yeah, you're welcome.
1;8;Rixty Minutes;Summer;Yeah, thank you guys so much. It's a real treat to be raised by parents that force themselves to be together instead of being happy.
1;8;Rixty Minutes;Rick;"Hey, do we have any wafer cookies? Mm! Oh, boy. Looks like you guys have been checking out alternate lives and realizing you don't have it as good, huh? That's too bad. You know, me and Morty are having a blast, We just discovered a show called Ball Fondlers"". I mean"
1;8;Rixty Minutes;Rick;I'm in heaven right now.
1;8;Rixty Minutes;Morty;This might be the best day of my life.
1;8;Rixty Minutes;Beth;So now what do we do?
1;8;Rixty Minutes;Jerry;"That show Ball Fondlers"" sounded kind of interesting."""
1;8;Rixty Minutes;Summer;Dad!
1;8;Rixty Minutes;Jerry;What? They're having fun in there! What do you guys want from me? Every family on this block has to wonder if they're together by choice. Our family just has inter-dimensional goggles to show us for a fact that we're not.
1;8;Rixty Minutes;Summer;Well, I'm leaving!
1;8;Rixty Minutes;Beth;You can't leave, you're 17!
1;8;Rixty Minutes;Summer;Yeah, and I'm not pregnant. I'm gonna have better judgment than you guys had at my age. I'm gonna... move to the southwest and-- I don't know, do something with turquoise.

1;8;Rixty Minutes;Morty;Wait wait, Rick! Hold on hold on...
1;8;Rixty Minutes;Fake Doors Salesman;...give it a second thought. That's our slogan. See it on the bottom of the screen, below our name. Here's another slogan, right below that one. What are you worried about? Come get fake doors! Get in here quick, get out quicker, with an arm of fake doors in you arms.
1;8;Rixty Minutes;Morty;Okay, okay, you can change it.
1;8;Rixty Minutes;Fake Doors Salesman;Don't even worry about it!
1;8;Rixty Minutes;Gazorpazorpfield;I hate Mumunmunundsdays. And I really could go for some enchiladas.
1;8;Rixty Minutes;Morty;Hey Rick, that's pretty cool! It's just like Garfield, only instead, it's Gazorpazorpfield.
1;8;Rixty Minutes;Rick;Hey, isn't Gazorpazorp where-where uh, where those sex robots came from, remember? That whole thing?
1;8;Rixty Minutes;Morty;Yeah hey, that's pretty, pretty that's true. That's right!
1;8;Rixty Minutes;Rick;Yeah. Let's watch some more Gazorpazorpfield!
1;8;Rixty Minutes;Gazorpazorpfield;Hey Jon, it's me, Gazorpazorpfield. Boy, fuck you, Jon. You dumb, stupid, idiot.

1;8;Rixty Minutes;Jon;Jeez, Gazorpazorpfield, that's-- you know you're pretty mean to me, but that takes the cake.
1;8;Rixty Minutes;Gazorpazorpfield;I don't give a fuck! I'm Gazorpazorp-fucking-field, bitch! Now give me my fucking enchiladas!
1;8;Rixty Minutes;Morty;Hey, Rick, you know, di-did they use Bill Murray for this? Sounds a lot like Bill Murray.
1;8;Rixty Minutes;Rick;No, Morty, it's Lorenzo Music. In this reality, he's still alive.
1;8;Rixty Minutes;Morty;Oh, okay, was his name Lorenzo Music?
1;8;Rixty Minutes;Rick;Yeah, I'm pretty sure. He also did that voice of that one guy from Ghostbusters, which is really strange, because it's the same character Bill Murray played in the movie. But then, when they made the movie Bill Murray did the voice of Gazorpazorp-- or Garfield, I mean.
1;8;Rixty Minutes;Morty;Yeah, that's pretty cool, Rick. So all that happened in this reality too?
1;8;Rixty Minutes;Rick;I don't know. Just making conversation with you, Morty. What do you think? I-I-I-I know everything about everything?
1;8;Rixty Minutes;Beth;Did you really talk me out of the abortion?
1;8;Rixty Minutes;Jerry;Well, we... we blew a tire on the way to the clinic.
1;8;Rixty Minutes;Beth;I think, in my head, I was doing it all for the kids. And now the first kid is going to... do something with turquoise.
1;8;Rixty Minutes;Jerry;Which is either code for crystal meth, or a gateway to it.
1;8;Rixty Minutes;Beth;So, we didn't do the kids any favors. So, we should stay together for each other and ourselves... or...
1;8;Rixty Minutes;Jerry;Or?
1;8;Rixty Minutes;Spokesman;Man. Woman. And now, trunk man? We know science has created men that have a trunk that allows them to have sex with both male and female partners.

I see demons are coming!
1;8;Rixty Minutes;Morty;Jeez, Rick. Oh my god! That's some pretty hardcore stuff, you know, for a cereal commercial.
1;8;Rixty Minutes;Rick;Well, you know, Morty, I mean, you want to sell boxes of cereal, you gotta, you gotta, pump the gas a little. Pedal t-to the metal, Morty.

1;8;Rixty Minutes;Regular Legs;Hey there.
1;8;Rixty Minutes;Baby Legs;Detective, I'm-- this is upsetting to me, because I feel like I don't need no regular-leg partner.
1;8;Rixty Minutes;Police Chief;Baby Legs, don't talk back to me. Good luck you two, there's a criminal to kill.
1;8;Rixty Minutes;Regular Legs;Wow! You sure found this guy quick!
1;8;Rixty Minutes;Baby Legs;Uh, yeah, because I'm a good detective.
1;8;Rixty Minutes;Regular Legs;Look, Baby Legs, it's the criminal!
1;8;Rixty Minutes;Criminal;Oh, fuck it, I'm the killer. I'm running, running real quick.
1;8;Rixty Minutes;Baby Legs;Baby Legs, here we go! That's the sound I make, when I'm trying to run fast. All right, I'm not going to get him. I'm, I-I just learned a real valuable lesson.
1;8;Rixty Minutes;Regular Legs;I'm coming, Baby Legs! I'm Regular Legs! We got him!
1;8;Rixty Minutes;Baby Legs;Hey, that was good team work.
1;8;Rixty Minutes;Police Chief;Baby Legs, and Regular Legs, I'm proud of you two for working together, and Baby Legs, I know it was hard for you to come to the conclusion that you need a partner. But I'm proud of you that you did it.

1;8;Rixty Minutes;Morty;Can I show you something?
1;8;Rixty Minutes;Summer;Morty, no offense, but a drawing of me you made when you were 8 isn't gonna make make me feel like less of an accident.
1;8;Rixty Minutes;Morty;That, out there? That's my grave.
1;8;Rixty Minutes;Summer;Wait, what?
1;8;Rixty Minutes;Morty;On one of our adventures, Rick and I basically destroyed the whole. World. So, we bailed on that reality, and we came to this one.

1;8;Rixty Minutes;Rick;Look, I don't know! I'm watching the-- same thing you guys are.
1;8;Rixty Minutes;Summer;Grandpa Rick, if they leave the butt, and the person wanders off, how would they find their butt person again?
1;8;Rixty Minutes;Rick;I don't know, Summer! I can't even hear the TV! All right, that's it. We're just gonna go there, so you idiots can ask your stupid questions all day.
1;8;Rixty Minutes;Jerry;Ooh! Family vacation!
1;9;Something Ricked This Way Comes;Morty;Hey Rick, I have to make a project for the science fair this weekend. You think you could help me out?
1;9;Something Ricked This Way Comes;Rick;Whatever.
1;9;Something Ricked This Way Comes;Jerry;Well, um, traditionally science fairs are a father-son thing.
1;9;Something Ricked This Way Comes;Rick;Well, scientifically, traditions are an idiot thing.
1;9;Something Ricked This Way Comes;Beth;Morty, I think it will be fun for you to work on a science project with your dad.
1;9;Something Ricked This Way Comes;Morty;Yeah, dad, why don’t we do it together?
1;9;Something Ricked This Way Comes;Jerry;Yes! You backed the right horse on this one, son! We’ll get out the crayons, brew some coffee and knock this thing out in two or three days.
1;9;Something Ricked This Way Comes;Butter robot;What is my purpose?
1;9;Something Ricked This Way Comes;Rick;Pass the butter. Thank you.
1;9;Something Ricked This Way Comes;Summer;Dad, I need a ride to work.
1;9;Something Ricked This Way Comes;Jerry;Maybe Rick can give you a ride. I’m helping Morty with science.
1;9;Something Ricked This Way Comes;Rick;I’m busy.
1;9;Something Ricked This Way Comes;Summer;Doing what?
1;9;Something Ricked This Way Comes;Rick;Uh, anything else?
1;9;Something Ricked This Way Comes;Butter robot;What is my purpose?
1;9;Something Ricked This Way Comes;Rick;You pass butter.
1;9;Something Ricked This Way Comes;Butter robot;Oh my god.
1;9;Something Ricked This Way Comes;Rick;Yeah, welcome to the club, pal.
1;9;Something Ricked This Way Comes;Rick;Since when did you have a job?
1;9;Something Ricked This Way Comes;Summer;Since last week. It’s part time at this little vintage thrift store. My boss is this really smart eccentric old man that treats me nice and values me.
1;9;Something Ricked This Way Comes;Rick;Wee-ow, can’t wait to meet this fascinating character.
1;9;Something Ricked This Way Comes;Summer;Please don’t.
1;9;Something Ricked This Way Comes;Mr. Goldenfold;Oh… when did this stop being jamba juice?
1;9;Something Ricked This Way Comes;Needful;I’ve just recently opened for business, Mr, um, Mr. Goldenfold.
1;9;Something Ricked This Way Comes;Mr. Goldenfold;You know my name? That’s disarming.
1;9;Something Ricked This Way Comes;Needful;I also know you long for female company.
1;9;Something Ricked This Way Comes;Mr. Goldenfold;You know, it has been lonely since the divorce. Some voids can’t be filled with jamba juice.
1;9;Something Ricked This Way Comes;Needful;This aftershave makes a man quite irresistible to women. Free of charge,one never pays here. Not with money.
1;9;Something Ricked This Way Comes;Mr. Goldenfold;Nothing to read into there! Thanks!
1;9;Something Ricked This Way Comes;Summer;Sorry I’m late, Mr. Needful. This is my grandpa Rick, he was just leaving.
1;9;Something Ricked This Way Comes;Rick;Huh.
1;9;Something Ricked This Way Comes;Needful;Tell me Rick, what do you desire?
1;9;Something Ricked This Way Comes;Rick;Eh, I make my own stuff. So what are you, like, the devil?
1;9;Something Ricked This Way Comes;Needful;What? Sorry?
1;9;Something Ricked This Way Comes;Rick;"I dunno, store comes out of nowhere, all the shit’s old and creepy; are you the devil? A demon? Leprechaun?"
1;9;Something Ricked This Way Comes;Summer;Grandpa Rick!
1;9;Something Ricked This Way Comes;Rick;Hey, I’m not judging. I just like to shoot straight. I’m a man of science.
1;9;Something Ricked This Way Comes;Needful;Ahah. Then perhaps you could make use of this. This microscope reveals things beyond comprehension. Hahahaha.
1;9;Something Ricked This Way Comes;Rick;Hahahahaha.
1;9;Something Ricked This Way Comes;Summer;Grandpa, go home and drink!
1;9;Something Ricked This Way Comes;Jerry;Why don’t we do a model of the solar system? That’s what my dad did with me when I was your age.
1;9;Something Ricked This Way Comes;Morty;Oh. Ok.
1;9;Something Ricked This Way Comes;Jerry;You know, Rick’s in his lab making cyborgs and wormholes and all that weird stuff, but this is real science! A man and his boy, making planets! Hey, how ‘bout we use a ping-pong ball for Pluto, and then Jupiter-
1;9;Something Ricked This Way Comes;Morty;Uh, actually, I don’t think Pluto’s a planet.
1;9;Something Ricked This Way Comes;Jerry;Of course Pluto’s a planet, son, I learned that in the third grade.
1;9;Something Ricked This Way Comes;Morty;Well, yeah, but, you know, they changed it.
1;9;Something Ricked This Way Comes;Jerry;Morty, nobody changed the planets.
1;9;Something Ricked This Way Comes;Morty;I just googled it. Uh, Pluto’s not a planet. They changed it in 2006.
1;9;Something Ricked This Way Comes;Jerry;Yeah, I heard about that, Morty. And I disagree.
1;9;Something Ricked This Way Comes;Morty;You… disagree?
1;9;Something Ricked This Way Comes;Jerry;That’s right. It’s possible to disagree in science, Morty. Pluto was a planet, some committee of fancy assholes disagree, I disagreed back. Gimmie a ping-pong ball.
1;9;Something Ricked This Way Comes;Morty;Um, ok, I just have to-
1;9;Something Ricked This Way Comes;Jerry;Go find Rick and go for my head about Pluto?
1;9;Something Ricked This Way Comes;Morty;Gee-no! Geez! I just gotta go to the bathroom! Damn!
1;9;Something Ricked This Way Comes;Jerry;Oh. Okay good. This is gonna be fun!
1;9;Something Ricked This Way Comes;Rick;Hey, Morty, lemme ask you a question real quick. Does evil exist, and if so, can one detect and measure it?
1;9;Something Ricked This Way Comes;Morty;Um…
1;9;Something Ricked This Way Comes;Rick;Rhetorical question Morty. The answer is yes, you just have to be a genius.
1;9;Something Ricked This Way Comes;Rick;Your sister’s boss gave me a microscope that would have made me retarded.
1;9;Something Ricked This Way Comes;Morty;Ooh, oh boy Rick, I don’t think you’re allowed to say that word, you know?
1;9;Something Ricked This Way Comes;Rick;Uh, Morty, I’m not disparaging the differently abled. I’m stating the fact that if I had used this microscope, it would have made me mentally retarded.
1;9;Something Ricked This Way Comes;Morty;Okay, yeah, but I don’t think it’s about logic, Rick. I think the word’s just become a symbolic issue for powerful groups that feel like they’re doing the right thing.
1;9;Something Ricked This Way Comes;Rick;Well that’s retarded.
1;9;Something Ricked This Way Comes;Jerry;What are you guys talking about?
1;9;Something Ricked This Way Comes;Rick;Apparently nothing.
1;9;Something Ricked This Way Comes;Jerry;You asked him if Pluto’s a planet, didn’t you?
1;9;Something Ricked This Way Comes;Morty;No!
1;9;Something Ricked This Way Comes;Rick;It’s not.
1;9;Something Ricked This Way Comes;Jerry;Shut up, Rick.
1;9;Something Ricked This Way Comes;Rick;Whoa.
1;9;Something Ricked This Way Comes;Jerry;I don’t care what anyone says. If it can be a planet, it can be a planet again. Planet. Planet, planet, planet.
1;9;Something Ricked This Way Comes;Rick;Stay scientific, Jerry.
1;9;Something Ricked This Way Comes;Mr. Goldenfold;This aftershave made women want me but it also made me impotent!
1;9;Something Ricked This Way Comes;Needful;A price for everything, Mr. Goldenfold. A price… for everything! Muahahahaha!
1;9;Something Ricked This Way Comes;Mr. Goldenfold;Oh my god! How can I not see this coming? My lust! My greed! I deserve thi-
1;9;Something Ricked This Way Comes;Rick;This serum should counteract the negative effects.
1;9;Something Ricked This Way Comes;Mr. Goldenfold;Holy cats! Ladies, let’s get out of here.
1;9;Something Ricked This Way Comes;Mr. Goldenfold;I haven’t learned a thing!
1;9;Something Ricked This Way Comes;Rick;Here. You can have this back.
1;9;Something Ricked This Way Comes;Needful;You didn’t use it?
1;9;Something Ricked This Way Comes;Rick;Sure I did. To develop this. It detects and catalogues all your Twilight Zone Ray Bradbury Friday the 13th of series voodoo crap magic. I thought you might want it so you didn’t accidentally sell anybody, say, a typewriter that generates best-selling murder mysteries, then makes the murders happen in real life? Oooh.
1;9;Something Ricked This Way Comes;Needful;Be quiet!
1;9;Something Ricked This Way Comes;Rick;Don’t you want to make sure people know what they’re getting? You’re not intentionally selling beauty cream that makes ugly ladies pretty but also makes them blind?
1;9;Something Ricked This Way Comes;Needful;I find this all quite preposterous!
1;9;Something Ricked This Way Comes;Rick;Oh, I say, good sir! Oh, harrumph, oh, oh, bobba-doppa-doopa-bo-bo. That’s beautiful, you know it’s going to be wearing you in three hours?
1;9;Something Ricked This Way Comes;Needful;Do I need to call the police?
1;9;Something Ricked This Way Comes;Rick;Here, you can use my phone. Don’t worry, it won’t make you deaf because I’m not a hack.
1;9;Something Ricked This Way Comes;Summer;Hey! No! Ugh!
1;9;Something Ricked This Way Comes;Rick;Think you’re so great?
1;9;Something Ricked This Way Comes;Summer;Stop it!
1;9;Something Ricked This Way Comes;Summer;No! Stop! Hey, hey! Stop it right now!
1;9;Something Ricked This Way Comes;Summer;Grandpa Rick, I like working here!
1;9;Something Ricked This Way Comes;Rick;You work for the devil!
1;9;Something Ricked This Way Comes;Summer;So what?
1;9;Something Ricked This Way Comes;Rick;"So what""?!"" "
1;9;Something Ricked This Way Comes;Needful;"So what""?!"""
1;9;Something Ricked This Way Comes;Summer;Yes, so what if he’s the devil, Rick? At least the devil has a job. At least he’s active in the community. What do you do? You eat our food, and make gadgets. Buh bye.
1;9;Something Ricked This Way Comes;Rick;Whoops.
1;9;Something Ricked This Way Comes;Summer;I’m sorry Mr. Needful, I’ll clean that up. I don’t know what I can do about the ghost lady that came out of it, but…
1;9;Something Ricked This Way Comes;Needful;It’s fine. Summer, you know your grandfather’s right. This store curses people. That’s my business.
1;9;Something Ricked This Way Comes;Summer;Well, yeah, fast food gives people diabetes and clothing stores have sweatshops. Is there a company hiring teenagers that isn’t evil? This is my first job. You’ve been nice to me, Mr. Needful. You respect me.
1;9;Something Ricked This Way Comes;Needful;Please, call me the devil.
1;9;Something Ricked This Way Comes;Summer;I’d rather not, actually.
1;9;Something Ricked This Way Comes;Needful;Yes, perhaps not during business hours.
1;9;Something Ricked This Way Comes;Jerry;I told you, I want to file a declaration that Pluto is a planet! … Well, then my son’s going to fail his science class, and when that happens, I’m suing you first! [hangs up] I think I know what the A in NASA stands for.
1;9;Something Ricked This Way Comes;Morty;Dad, what’s your endgame?
1;9;Something Ricked This Way Comes;Jerry;Ain’t no game, sucka.
1;9;Something Ricked This Way Comes;Morty;Why don’t we just make the solar system with eight planets? It’s even easier!
1;9;Something Ricked This Way Comes;Jerry;Sure, sure, and why don’t we just burn Galileo at the stake for saying the sun is round? Science isn’t always easy, Morty!
1;9;Something Ricked This Way Comes;Morty;Whoa, whoa! Whoa!
1;9;Something Ricked This Way Comes;Jerry;What the hell?
1;9;Something Ricked This Way Comes;Flippynips;I’m King Flippynips, ruler of Pluto!
1;9;Something Ricked This Way Comes;Flippynips;We discovered you quite by accident during routine surveillance of your world. You really gave it to those guys at NASA!
1;9;Something Ricked This Way Comes;Jerry;I was… you know… sometimes science is about conviction.
1;9;Something Ricked This Way Comes;Flippynips;I’d like to introduce you to a few people that very much agree with you.
1;9;Something Ricked This Way Comes;Jerry;Oh. I…
1;9;Something Ricked This Way Comes;Flippynips;Plutonians! Jerry Smith is a scientist from Earth where he’s creating a model of our solar system! Jerry, tell Pluto about your decision!
1;9;Something Ricked This Way Comes;Jerry;Pluto… is a planet.
1;9;Something Ricked This Way Comes;Flippynips;Pluto’s a fucking planet, bitch!
1;9;Something Ricked This Way Comes;Morty;Oh man, this is definitely gonna go to his head.
1;9;Something Ricked This Way Comes;Needful;If it’s athletic prowess you desire, principal Vagina, I might-
1;9;Something Ricked This Way Comes;Vagina;I’ll take it!
1;9;Something Ricked This Way Comes;Needful;But I haven’t even-
1;9;Something Ricked This Way Comes;Vagina;Thank you very very much, great store, great place, bye.
1;9;Something Ricked This Way Comes;Needful;Huh. Okay. I must say, Summer, I thought your grandfather’s outburst would have disrupted business, but this is the best weekend I’ve had since Salem!
1;9;Something Ricked This Way Comes;Summer;Nice! Wholesome delight for lunch?
1;9;Something Ricked This Way Comes;Needful;Is that the vegan place?
1;9;Something Ricked This Way Comes;Summer;Yeah, I love their soup.
1;9;Something Ricked This Way Comes;Needful;I’m kind of souped out.
1;9;Something Ricked This Way Comes;Needful;Mrs. Tate, is it? What do you desire?
1;9;Something Ricked This Way Comes;Needful;Whoa, whoa, slow down, honey!
1;9;Something Ricked This Way Comes;Tate;Oh, is there a limit? Everything’s free, right?
1;9;Something Ricked This Way Comes;Summer;Let’s just say… you don’t pay with money.
1;9;Something Ricked This Way Comes;Needful;That was perfect.
1;9;Something Ricked This Way Comes;Tate;You pay with the curses, right?
1;9;Something Ricked This Way Comes;Needful;Um, I… well-
1;9;Something Ricked This Way Comes;Needful;But Mrs. Tate! Why do you want cursed items?
1;9;Something Ricked This Way Comes;Tate;Well, I’m going to get the curses removed. At curse purge plus. You know, the guy on TV?
1;9;Something Ricked This Way Comes;Needful;What?
1;9;Something Ricked This Way Comes;Rick;Have you acquired creepy, specific old stuff from an antique or thrift store that gives you powers but fucks with you in unforeseeable ways? Bring it to Curse Purge Plus! I use science to uncurse the items for cash, and you get to keep the powers! This guy got mysterious sneakers to make him run faster! But guess what? He would have had to run until he died, making them worthless. I removed the curse, making them worth, like, I dunno, $8,000,000? See ya at the Olympics. This eerily intelligent doll was threatening to murder its family. Now it does their taxes.
1;9;Something Ricked This Way Comes;Baby;Everything’s deductible.
1;9;Something Ricked This Way Comes;Rick;Don’t pay for cool stuff with your soul. Pay for it with money. You know, like how every other store in the world works? We’re located at First and Main in old town. Come on, come on down.
1;9;Something Ricked This Way Comes;Needful;First… and…
1;9;Something Ricked This Way Comes;Rick;Wubba… lubba… dub dub!
1;9;Something Ricked This Way Comes;Rick;Wubba lubba dub dub!
1;9;Something Ricked This Way Comes;Rick;That’s right across the street from Needful Things, where you can get evil items for free!
1;9;Something Ricked This Way Comes;Needful;Diabolical son of a mother-
1;9;Something Ricked This Way Comes;Hostess;We’re back on Good Morning Pluto, and a very good morning it is for our guest, Earth scientist Jerry Smith, who is making headlines with his bold announcement that is, what Jerry?
1;9;Something Ricked This Way Comes;Jerry;Pluto is a planet.
1;9;Something Ricked This Way Comes;Host;How about that?
1;9;Something Ricked This Way Comes;Hostess;Wow. I love it!
1;9;Something Ricked This Way Comes;Scroopy Noopers;Morty Smith. I’m Scroopy Noopers. I’m a scientist. Can I show you something?
1;9;Something Ricked This Way Comes;Morty;Uh… I’d better not.
1;9;Something Ricked This Way Comes;Scroopy Noopers;Right now.
1;9;Something Ricked This Way Comes;Scroopy Noopers;The centre of Pluto, Mr. Smith, is made up of a substance called plutonium. Mines like these suck Plutonium up to the cities, where corporations use it to power everything, from diamond cars to golden showers. And the more we remove, the more Pluto shrinks.
1;9;Something Ricked This Way Comes;Scroopy Noopers;There it goes again. Just shrank a little. But a few years ago, your scientists had noticed Pluto had gotten so small they couldn’t even call it a planet any more. Should have been our wake up call. But the rich plutonians won’t wake up. And they love your dad telling everyone Pluto’s a planet, because that means they can keep mining until Pluto goes from planet to asteroid to meteor, and finally, poof.
1;9;Something Ricked This Way Comes;Morty;Um… A party?
1;9;Something Ricked This Way Comes;Scroopy Noopers;Is everyone in your family an idiot?
1;9;Something Ricked This Way Comes;Morty;For sure me and my dad are.
1;9;Something Ricked This Way Comes;Scroopy Noopers;Well, all you have to do is get him to admit that, and you could save four billion lives.
1;9;Something Ricked This Way Comes;Morty;Uh, yeah, you know, the thing is… my dad’s really insecure.
1;9;Something Ricked This Way Comes;Summer;Hm, funny. Mr Needful, out of everything in the store you’ll never guess what we couldn’t get rid of!
1;9;Something Ricked This Way Comes;Summer;Ah! Oh my god!
1;9;Something Ricked This Way Comes;Summer;Oh my god. I wish this desk was lighter!
1;9;Something Ricked This Way Comes;Summer;I wish this knot was looser!
1;9;Something Ricked This Way Comes;Summer;Come on! I don’t… Augh! Wait! What am I doing? I wish I knew CPR!
1;9;Something Ricked This Way Comes;Summer;One, two, three! One, two, three!
1;9;Something Ricked This Way Comes;Needful;Ugh, Jesus. What a waste of a monkey paw.
1;9;Something Ricked This Way Comes;Summer;Mr. Needful! How could you even think of doing something so horrible?
1;9;Something Ricked This Way Comes;Needful;I’m the devil. What should I do when I fail, give myself an ice-cream?
1;9;Something Ricked This Way Comes;Summer;You haven’t failed.
1;9;Something Ricked This Way Comes;Needful;People like Rick are making me obsolete. I mean seriously, I may be the devil but your grandpa is the devil! I just want to go back to hell where everybody thinks I’m smart and funny.
1;9;Something Ricked This Way Comes;Summer;No! It’s not fair. Everyone in this town got something they wanted from you, even Rick! I was your only friend, and I get nothing?
1;9;Something Ricked This Way Comes;Needful;Okay, I’ll give you one thing. Name it.
1;9;Something Ricked This Way Comes;Summer;I wanna help you.
1;9;Something Ricked This Way Comes;Needful;Clever twist.
1;9;Something Ricked This Way Comes;Summer;I learned from the best, you old fart. Now let’s go get you hydrated.
1;9;Something Ricked This Way Comes;Rick;Looks like we’ve got… haunted boxing gloves that will make you the heavyweight champion, in 1936 and then you’ll be trapped there winning the same fight for eternity. I can take out the eternity, and the padding, and then you’ll have some time travelling mittens.
1;9;Something Ricked This Way Comes;Rick;Oh, look, it’s Rosemary’s baby! How’s business?
1;9;Something Ricked This Way Comes;Summer;Here’s the last of our inventory. We’re going to file chapter 11 and do some restructuring.
1;9;Something Ricked This Way Comes;Rick;Sounds like code for ‘You win, Rick!’
1;9;Something Ricked This Way Comes;Summer;That was important to you, wasn’t it?
1;9;Something Ricked This Way Comes;Rick;Nope, it was important to your dumb devil friend. To me this was all just a bit like when Bugs Bunny fucks with the opera singer for twenty minutes.
1;9;Something Ricked This Way Comes;Summer;He tried to kill himself.
1;9;Something Ricked This Way Comes;Rick;Seriously? Holy crap. Holy crap.
1;9;Something Ricked This Way Comes;Summer;But you know what, grandpa Rick? He’s strong. And he’s never going to give up.
1;9;Something Ricked This Way Comes;Rick;Uh huh, yeah, I don’t care.
1;9;Something Ricked This Way Comes;Summer;Oh, I know. Everyone knows you don’t care.
1;9;Something Ricked This Way Comes;Rick;"So?"""
1;9;Something Ricked This Way Comes;Summer;So… have fun not caring.
1;9;Something Ricked This Way Comes;Rick;I always do.
1;9;Something Ricked This Way Comes;Summer;Good.
1;9;Something Ricked This Way Comes;Rick;Yeah, it is good. It’s the best.
1;9;Something Ricked This Way Comes;Summer;I’m sure it is. Bye.
1;9;Something Ricked This Way Comes;Rick;Later!
1;9;Something Ricked This Way Comes;Customer;I’m here to pick up my undead cat and child.
1;9;Something Ricked This Way Comes;Rick;Yeah, uh, gimmie a sec.
1;9;Something Ricked This Way Comes;Employee;These are the forms for the employee health plan.
1;9;Something Ricked This Way Comes;Rick;Alright, yeah, uh, put ‘em on my… eh... I just got bored. Everybody out.
1;9;Something Ricked This Way Comes;Jerry;Alright, just one more rally, then I promise, we’ll get back to your science project.
1;9;Something Ricked This Way Comes;Morty;Dad, Pluto isn’t a planet! It’s shrinking because of corporations!
1;9;Something Ricked This Way Comes;Jerry;Yeah, that’s what that anti-planet nutjob Scroopy Noopers was screaming about outside the Ministry of Moneys fundraiser. Are you telling me four billion plutonians are wrong?
1;9;Something Ricked This Way Comes;Morty;You told me science wasn’t easy!
1;9;Something Ricked This Way Comes;Jerry;I said science isn’t always easy, obviously that means sometimes it is easy. Let’s not debase ourselves with word games, son.
1;9;Something Ricked This Way Comes;Morty;Dad, their whole planet is dying!
1;9;Something Ricked This Way Comes;Jerry;Hah! You called it a planet! Checkmate.
1;9;Something Ricked This Way Comes;Jerry;What’s up, Pluto?
1;9;Something Ricked This Way Comes;Plutonian woman;Mr. Smith, please! Tell my friend here what you just told me, go on.
1;9;Something Ricked This Way Comes;Jerry;My Very Eager Mother Just Served Us Nine Pickles, and the pickles is Pluto.
1;9;Something Ricked This Way Comes;Plutonian man;My god! The man’s a genius!
1;9;Something Ricked This Way Comes;Morty;Um, excuse me?
1;9;Something Ricked This Way Comes;Jerry;Morty, what?
1;9;Something Ricked This Way Comes;Morty;Dad, what did you think about the recent report published by the Pluto Science Reader, linking plutoquakes, sinkholes and surface shrinkage to deep core plutonium drilling?
1;9;Something Ricked This Way Comes;Jerry;...Well son, what did you think when you were five, and you pooped your pants, and you threw your poopy undies out your bedroom window because you thought it was like throwing something in the garbage?
1;9;Something Ricked This Way Comes;Jerry;I mean, I’m trimming the hedges and these things are just hanging there, was I supposed to think the poop bunny left them?
1;9;Something Ricked This Way Comes;Morty;Good one, dad.
1;9;Something Ricked This Way Comes;Rick;Hey Morty, you wanna go on a- oh. Hey Beth? Hello? Hey Jerry, you in here being stupid?
1;9;Something Ricked This Way Comes;Rick;Thanks. Hey, y’know, I was thinking I might watch a movie…
1;9;Something Ricked This Way Comes;Butter robot;I am not programmed for friendship.
1;9;Something Ricked This Way Comes;Rick;Suit yourself.
1;9;Something Ricked This Way Comes;Rick;Hey! Hey. What’s going on?
1;9;Something Ricked This Way Comes;Morty;Um… listen, can you help me do this stupid science fair project?
1;9;Something Ricked This Way Comes;Rick;Whatever.
1;9;Something Ricked This Way Comes;Flippynips;Jerry, you must be so excited! The Plutobell Prize is the highest honour a scientist can receive!
1;9;Something Ricked This Way Comes;Jerry;I’m flattered, and humbled.
1;9;Something Ricked This Way Comes;Flippynips;Ooh, I like that. Use that in your speech. Also, talk about Pluto being a planet, people like that.
1;9;Something Ricked This Way Comes;Policeman;Your highness! We’ve captured Scroopy Noopers!
1;9;Something Ricked This Way Comes;Scroopy Noopers;You animals! Animals!
1;9;Something Ricked This Way Comes;Flippynips;Ooh, look whose little journey’s come to an end! Take him to Plutonimo Bay!
1;9;Something Ricked This Way Comes;Scroopy Noopers;You can’t kill the truth, father!
1;9;Something Ricked This Way Comes;Jerry;What?
1;9;Something Ricked This Way Comes;Flippynips;I can see you’re confused. Plutonimo bay is a military prison, a sort of play on words-
1;9;Something Ricked This Way Comes;Jerry;Did he call you father? Scroopy Noopers, the anti-planet nutjob is your son?
1;9;Something Ricked This Way Comes;Flippynips;The young eat the old if you let them, Jerry. Pluto is a cold, cold celestial dwarf.
1;9;Something Ricked This Way Comes;Jerry;It’s a what?
1;9;Something Ricked This Way Comes;Flippynips;Huh? Oh- planet! Hah! Hoh, Pluto is a cold cold planet! That’s what I meant. Knock ‘em dead out there, you.
1;9;Something Ricked This Way Comes;Jerry;Pluto is… Not a planet.
1;9;Something Ricked This Way Comes;Crowd;Boo!
1;9;Something Ricked This Way Comes;Jerry;Ow! It’s not a planet! Hey! It’s not a planet! I’m an idiot, and I love my son!
1;9;Something Ricked This Way Comes;Needful;It’s been a long six hours, but we’ve overhauled Needful Things into the globally compliant, web 4.0 e-nomenon, n33dful.com! Spelled with 3s instead of Es.
1;9;Something Ricked This Way Comes;Crowd;Woot! Yeah! Woot! Excited!
1;9;Something Ricked This Way Comes;Needful;Okay, that’s it! We just got bought by Google!
1;9;Something Ricked This Way Comes;Crowd;Yeah!
1;9;Something Ricked This Way Comes;Summer;Mmh! I’m so proud of you, Lucius. So… how much did we make?
1;9;Something Ricked This Way Comes;Needful;Haha. ‘We.’ This is my business! Security!
1;9;Something Ricked This Way Comes;Summer;Ah! You’re Zuckerberging me?
1;9;Something Ricked This Way Comes;Needful;I was Zuckerberging people before Zuckerberg’s balls dropped. I’m the devil, beeyotch! What what!
1;9;Something Ricked This Way Comes;Jerry;Hey! Hey Morty.
1;9;Something Ricked This Way Comes;Morty;Oh! Hey dad! Um… What are you doing back from Pluto so quick?
1;9;Something Ricked This Way Comes;Jerry;Ah, some people just can’t handle the truth. Especially dummies like me. Morty, I’m not as smart as your grandpa Rick, but I promise never to make that your problem again.
1;9;Something Ricked This Way Comes;Morty;Hey, dad? Nobody’s smarter than Rick. But nobody else is my dad. You’re a genius at that.
1;9;Something Ricked This Way Comes;Jerry;Wow… that’s humbling… and flattering, son. Thank you. What say we finish ourselves an 8-planet solar system?
1;9;Something Ricked This Way Comes;Morty;Um… I’m just going to take this thing in and… get an A.
1;9;Something Ricked This Way Comes;Butter robot;Butter.
1;9;Something Ricked This Way Comes;Jerry;But-
1;9;Something Ricked This Way Comes;Morty;You’re a genius at being my dad, dad. Quit while you’re ahead. And also, knock next time, you know? I mean, I’m sitting in here, I’m 14! I got a computer in here, you know!
1;9;Something Ricked This Way Comes;Jerry;Oh. I uh- I think I underst-
1;9;Something Ricked This Way Comes;Morty;You know you’re really playing with fire when you burst in here like that, man.
1;9;Something Ricked This Way Comes;Jerry;I get it! Say no more.
1;9;Something Ricked This Way Comes;Morty;I mean, one of these days, you know, you’re gonna, you’re gonna end up seeing something-
1;9;Something Ricked This Way Comes;Jerry;I got it! Noted! Goodnight!
1;9;Something Ricked This Way Comes;Rick;How’s your pretend grandpa doing AKA the devil?
1;9;Something Ricked This Way Comes;Summer;He dumped me.
1;9;Something Ricked This Way Comes;Rick;Oof, sorry.
1;9;Something Ricked This Way Comes;Summer;Did we learn a lesson here I’m not seeing?
1;9;Something Ricked This Way Comes;Rick;Hm, not sure.
1;9;Something Ricked This Way Comes;Summer;Maybe in a much bigger way, Mr. Needful gave us both what we really wanted? Because I was always jealous of you hanging out with Morty and you didn’t realise how much you valued my approval?
1;9;Something Ricked This Way Comes;Rick;No, that’s dumb.
1;9;Something Ricked This Way Comes;Summer;Nah, not satisfying.
1;9;Something Ricked This Way Comes;Rick;I’ll tell you what though, if it’s satisfaction you’re after, I think I might have an idea.
1;9;Something Ricked This Way Comes;Summer;Uh huh… uh huh… uh huh totally let’s do it!
1;9;Something Ricked This Way Comes;Needful;And that’s how I took my storefront into the forefront of the upfront! Thank you Seattle!
1;9;Something Ricked This Way Comes;Needful;Rick? Summer?
1;9;Something Ricked This Way Comes;Rick;Stupid mother-
1;9;Something Ricked This Way Comes;Summer;Stupid bitch!
1;9;Something Ricked This Way Comes;Rick;Stupid motherfucker!
1;9;Something Ricked This Way Comes;Summer;Get some!
1;9;Something Ricked This Way Comes;Rick;How do you like that! Augh! How do you like that?
1;9;Something Ricked This Way Comes;Needful;Ugh… Why?
1;9;Something Ricked This Way Comes;Summer;Because sometimes what you really need is for someone else to pay a horrible price.
1;9;Something Ricked This Way Comes;Rick;We did it!
1;9;Something Ricked This Way Comes;Summer;Haha, yeah bro. Yeah! Haha!
1;9;Something Ricked This Way Comes;Rick;Was totally worth it! We did it, hahaha! We just pulled it off!
1;9;Something Ricked This Way Comes;Summer;Yeah bro!
1;9;Something Ricked This Way Comes;Rick;Hahaha!
1;9;Something Ricked This Way Comes;Summer;Yeah.
1;10;Close Rick-Counters of the Rick Kind;Beth;So dad, guess what tomorrow is...
1;10;Close Rick-Counters of the Rick Kind;Rick;Martin Luther King Jr.'s birthday.
1;10;Close Rick-Counters of the Rick Kind;Beth;No... well, it might be...
1;10;Close Rick-Counters of the Rick Kind;Rick;It is.
1;10;Close Rick-Counters of the Rick Kind;Beth;Fine, but also, tomorrow is your one year anniversary back in our lives. I'm gonna make you flying saucer-shaped pancakes.
1;10;Close Rick-Counters of the Rick Kind;Rick;Oh, there's no need to do that, Beth. Regular pancakes are fine.
1;10;Close Rick-Counters of the Rick Kind;Beth;Happy anniversary, dad!
1;10;Close Rick-Counters of the Rick Kind;Rick;Oh, I get it. Regular pancakes are already shaped like flying saucers. Mmm, I should be making you breakfast for putting up with me.
1;10;Close Rick-Counters of the Rick Kind;Jerry;Should be making us a whole restaurant.
1;10;Close Rick-Counters of the Rick Kind;Beth;Nonsense, we couldn’t be happier to have you around. I just wish I got to see more of you.
1;10;Close Rick-Counters of the Rick Kind;Rick 1;Rick Sanchez of Earth dimension C-137. You are under arrest for crimes against alternate Ricks by the authority of the transdimensional council of Ricks.
1;10;Close Rick-Counters of the Rick Kind;Jerry;Hey! What the heck?
1;10;Close Rick-Counters of the Rick Kind;Rick 1;Neutralise the Jerry.
1;10;Close Rick-Counters of the Rick Kind;Jerry;Wait, no!
1;10;Close Rick-Counters of the Rick Kind;Summer;Dad!
1;10;Close Rick-Counters of the Rick Kind;Beth;Dad!
1;10;Close Rick-Counters of the Rick Kind;Morty;Rick!
1;10;Close Rick-Counters of the Rick Kind;Rick (C-137);Everybody relax. If I know these a-holes, and I am these a-holes, they just wanna haul me to their stupid clubhouse and waste my time with a bunch of questions. Let’s get it over with.
1;10;Close Rick-Counters of the Rick Kind;Rick 1;Bring his Mo--orty.
1;10;Close Rick-Counters of the Rick Kind;Morty;Oh, man.
1;10;Close Rick-Counters of the Rick Kind;Rick (C-137);Leave my Morty out of this!
1;10;Close Rick-Counters of the Rick Kind;Rick 1;You lost the right to have a say in these things when you refused to join the council.
1;10;Close Rick-Counters of the Rick Kind;Beth;Wait, wh-wh-wh-what about Jerry?
1;10;Close Rick-Counters of the Rick Kind;Rick (C-137);Will you at least unfreeze my daughter’s idiot?
1;10;Close Rick-Counters of the Rick Kind;Jerry;-give you anything! I have a rare antique coin collection, just don’t hurt me! Okay, maybe not antique, but it was a limited minting. They have little R2D2s instead of George Washingtons.
1;10;Close Rick-Counters of the Rick Kind;Beth;Our son’s been abducted!
1;10;Close Rick-Counters of the Rick Kind;Jerry;You hate me for buying those coins!
1;10;Close Rick-Counters of the Rick Kind;Morty (C-137);Geez, Rick! Wh-what is this place?
1;10;Close Rick-Counters of the Rick Kind;Rick (C-137);The citadel of Ricks. It’s the secret headquarters for the council of Ricks.
1;10;Close Rick-Counters of the Rick Kind;Morty (C-137);Council of Ricks?
1;10;Close Rick-Counters of the Rick Kind;Rick (C-137);As you know, Morty, I’ve got a lotta enemies in the universe that consider my genius a threat. Galactic terrorists, a few sub-galactic dictators, most of the entire intergalactic government,wh-wherever you find people with heads up their asses someone wants a piece of your grandpa. And a lot of versions of me on different timelines had the same problem. So a few thousand versions of me had the INGENIOUS IDEA OF BANDING TOGETHER like a herd of cattle or a school of fish or those people who answer questions on yahoo answers.
1;10;Close Rick-Counters of the Rick Kind;Morty (C-137);Hey, what do you know? It’s a cowboy version of me!
1;10;Close Rick-Counters of the Rick Kind;Rick (C-137);Geez, you’re easy to impress. Yeah, most timelines have a Rick and most Ricks have a Morty. This place is a real who’s-who of who’s you and me.
1;10;Close Rick-Counters of the Rick Kind;Rick Salesman 1;Turn your boring old Morty into a hot fashion statement, with some Morty dazzlers!
1;10;Close Rick-Counters of the Rick Kind;Rick Salesman 2;Hey, check this out!
1;10;Close Rick-Counters of the Rick Kind;Morty Doll;Show me the Morty!
1;10;Close Rick-Counters of the Rick Kind;Rick (C-137);Dumb.
1;10;Close Rick-Counters of the Rick Kind;Rick Salseman 3;‘Scuse me, sir, is your Morty insured? You know, every year hundreds of Mortys are injured in-
1;10;Close Rick-Counters of the Rick Kind;Rick (C-137);Back off! Not my cup of tea, this place.
1;10;Close Rick-Counters of the Rick Kind;Rick (C-137);I say the point of being a Rick is being a-Rick.
1;10;Close Rick-Counters of the Rick Kind;Rick 1;Save your anti-Rick speech for the council of Ricks, terror-Rick!
1;10;Close Rick-Counters of the Rick Kind;Rick (C-137);Hey, save your Rick rules for the sheep-Ricks, Rick-pig!
1;10;Close Rick-Counters of the Rick Kind;Rick 1;Fuck me, pal.
1;10;Close Rick-Counters of the Rick Kind;Rick (C-137);Fuck you? No no no no no, fuck me!
1;10;Close Rick-Counters of the Rick Kind;Rick Council 1;Bring up the holograms!
1;10;Close Rick-Counters of the Rick Kind;Rick Council 1;Twenty-seven Ricks brutally murdered in their own timelines. An unprecedented Rick-icidal epidemic. What say you, Earth Rick C-137?
1;10;Close Rick-Counters of the Rick Kind;Rick (C-137);You think I did this? Why am I the first Rick you pull in every time a Rick stubs his toe?
1;10;Close Rick-Counters of the Rick Kind;Rick Council 1;You have a history of non-cooperation with the council.
1;10;Close Rick-Counters of the Rick Kind;Rick (C-137);Yeah, so does the scientist formerly known as Rick! Wh-wh-wh-why isn’t he here in handcuffs?
1;10;Close Rick-Counters of the Rick Kind;Rick Council 1;Because he’s dead too! Who else would you have us question? You fit the profile. Of all the Ricks in the central finite curve, you’re the malcontent. The rogue.
1;10;Close Rick-Counters of the Rick Kind;Rick (C-137);I’m the Rick. And so were the rest of you before you formed this stupid alliance. You wanted to be safe from the government so you became a stupid government. That makes every Rick here less Rick than me.
1;10;Close Rick-Counters of the Rick Kind;Rick (C-137);Yeah, murmur it up, d-bags. Now if you’ll excuse me, I’ve got pancakes back home with syrup on top of them. They’re about to hit that critical point of syrup absorption that turns the cakes into a gross paste. And I hate to get all Andy Rooney about it, but I think we all like fluffy discs of cake with syrup on top! And I think we also like to be accused of crimes when there’s evidence! So as they say in Canada, peace oot!
1;10;Close Rick-Counters of the Rick Kind;Rick Council 1;Evidence? Good idea. Scan his portal gun!
1;10;Close Rick-Counters of the Rick Kind;Rick (C-137);Oh, come on. Don’t look at another man’s portal gun history. We-we all go to weird places.
1;10;Close Rick-Counters of the Rick Kind;Rick Council 1;Yes, but it appears you alone have been going to the exact timelines and locations in which the murders occured!
1;10;Close Rick-Counters of the Rick Kind;Rick (C-137);What? That’s Rick-diculous. I’m obviously being set up!
1;10;Close Rick-Counters of the Rick Kind;Rick Council 1;Earth Rick C-137! The council of Ricks sentences you to the machine of unspeakable doom, which swaps your conscious and unconscious minds, rendering your fantasies pointless while everything you know becomes impossible to grasp. Also every ten seconds it stabs your balls.
1;10;Close Rick-Counters of the Rick Kind;Rick (C-137);I’ve heard enough.
1;10;Close Rick-Counters of the Rick Kind;Rick (C-137);Run, Morty!
1;10;Close Rick-Counters of the Rick Kind;Morty (C-137);Aaaaah!
1;10;Close Rick-Counters of the Rick Kind;Armed Rick 1;Nooo!
1;10;Close Rick-Counters of the Rick Kind;Armed Rick 2;Arrrrgh! Ahhhh!
1;10;Close Rick-Counters of the Rick Kind;Armed Rick 3;Aaaah!
1;10;Close Rick-Counters of the Rick Kind;Morty (C-137);Oh! Oooh!
1;10;Close Rick-Counters of the Rick Kind;Pizza 1;Yeah, I’d like to order one large person with extra people please.
1;10;Close Rick-Counters of the Rick Kind;Pizza 2;White people. No no no no no, black people. And hispanic on half.
1;10;Close Rick-Counters of the Rick Kind;Phone 1;Yes, I’d like to order one large sofa chair with extra chair please.
1;10;Close Rick-Counters of the Rick Kind;Phone 2;High chair. No no no no no, recliner! And wheelchair on half.
1;10;Close Rick-Counters of the Rick Kind;Armed Rick 6;They could have gone into any one of these.
1;10;Close Rick-Counters of the Rick Kind;Sofa 1;Yeah, I’d like to order one large phone with extra phones please.
1;10;Close Rick-Counters of the Rick Kind;Sofa 2;Cellphone. No no no no no, rotary! And payphone on half.
1;10;Close Rick-Counters of the Rick Kind;Rick;That’ll keep ‘em busy for a while.
1;10;Close Rick-Counters of the Rick Kind;Morty;Those guys were wrong, right? You don’t- you wouldn’t kill yourself… y-yourselves?
1;10;Close Rick-Counters of the Rick Kind;Rick;‘Course not, Morty! How could that profit me? Someone out there is killing Ricks, and the council ain’t gonna stop thinking it’s me until we clear our names.
1;10;Close Rick-Counters of the Rick Kind;Rick;By finding the real Rick killer.
1;10;Close Rick-Counters of the Rick Kind;Morty;I’m scared, Rick! Maybe we should go home and stockpile weapons like that show Doomsday Preppers.
1;10;Close Rick-Counters of the Rick Kind;Rick;Not really my style, Morty. Besides, your home is most likely swarming with Ricks right now.
1;10;Close Rick-Counters of the Rick Kind;Rick 1;Alright, listen, Jerry. If Rick calls, this device is going to trace his location. You just gotta keep ‘em on the phone for thirty seconds or longer.
1;10;Close Rick-Counters of the Rick Kind;Beth;Who wants lemonade?
1;10;Close Rick-Counters of the Rick Kind;Rick 1;Oh yeah! Mmm! Oh, delicious!
1;10;Close Rick-Counters of the Rick Kind;Rick 2;Beth, you’re a treasure.
1;10;Close Rick-Counters of the Rick Kind;Rick 3;I have a Beth just like you in my reality, except you know what? She’s not as brilliant or attractive!
1;10;Close Rick-Counters of the Rick Kind;Beth;Aww, thank you!
1;10;Close Rick-Counters of the Rick Kind;All Ricks;Ohohoho! She did it! She did it!
1;10;Close Rick-Counters of the Rick Kind;Jerry;Uh, hello?
1;10;Close Rick-Counters of the Rick Kind;Rick;Hey Jerry, it’s Rick.
1;10;Close Rick-Counters of the Rick Kind;Jerry;Rick! Heyy. Haha, what’s- what’s up?
1;10;Close Rick-Counters of the Rick Kind;Rick;So listen, the heat’s on and there’s nowhere left to turn so Morty and I are just going to fly my spaceship into a black hole.
1;10;Close Rick-Counters of the Rick Kind;Jerry;What?
1;10;Close Rick-Counters of the Rick Kind;Rick;Is that cool with you, dog?
1;10;Close Rick-Counters of the Rick Kind;Jerry;Rick, no! Mortyyyy!
1;10;Close Rick-Counters of the Rick Kind;Rick 4;I got it! The call’s coming from… inside the house!
1;10;Close Rick-Counters of the Rick Kind;Rick;The Ricks are probably gonna waste some time messing with Jerry. They won’t be able to help themselves. But as soon as they get bored they’ll be on to us.
1;10;Close Rick-Counters of the Rick Kind;Chair waiter;Phones á la clams, and phonesgetti with phoneballs. Anything else?
1;10;Close Rick-Counters of the Rick Kind;Rick;Yeah, more phonesticks please.
1;10;Close Rick-Counters of the Rick Kind;Phone waiter;Right away, sir.
1;10;Close Rick-Counters of the Rick Kind;Morty;You know Rick, when I first saw all those Ricks and Mortys, I thought ‘gee, that kinda devalues our bond.’ But then I realised that just means that our relationship must be pretty special to span over all those different timelines.
1;10;Close Rick-Counters of the Rick Kind;Rick;Yeah, it’s gotta be that way. You’re a camouflage.
1;10;Close Rick-Counters of the Rick Kind;Morty;Camouflage? Wh-wh-what are you talking about, Rick?
1;10;Close Rick-Counters of the Rick Kind;Rick;Ricks have a very distinct and traceable brainwave due to our genius. The best way to hide from an enemy’s radar is to stand near someone with complementary brainwaves that make ours invisible. See, wh-wh-when a Rick is with a Morty, the genius waves get cancelled out by the uh, Morty waves.
1;10;Close Rick-Counters of the Rick Kind;Morty;Um… because… our personalities are so different?
1;10;Close Rick-Counters of the Rick Kind;Rick;Oh, shit dog! My portal gun was hacked remotely Morty, obviously by the real killer to frame me. But I was able to trace the signal. Come on, let’s go!
1;10;Close Rick-Counters of the Rick Kind;Rick (C-137);Uh-oh!
1;10;Close Rick-Counters of the Rick Kind;Rick 1;‘Scuse me, we’ve tracked a pair of dangerous criminals to this exact location. They look exactly like us, so in order to avoid confusion I’m going to mark us each with a red X right now. That way if someone has a gun and we both tell you to shoot the other one because they’re the evil one, you’ll know who’s lying.
1;10;Close Rick-Counters of the Rick Kind;Rick 2;Hey, check it out!
1;10;Close Rick-Counters of the Rick Kind;Rick 1;Dammit!
1;10;Close Rick-Counters of the Rick Kind;Chair waiter;Hey, you didn’t pay your bill!
1;10;Close Rick-Counters of the Rick Kind;Rick 1;The red X! Red X!
1;10;Close Rick-Counters of the Rick Kind;Rick;Hey, it’s a good thing that space outlet had labcoats and your favourite kind of shirt in stock, huh Morty?
1;10;Close Rick-Counters of the Rick Kind;Morty;Yeah, Rick. I-I heard you the first time. You don’t have to keep saying it over and over and over.
1;10;Close Rick-Counters of the Rick Kind;Rick;Man, this place is wayyy off the grid. This guy does not wanna be found.
1;10;Close Rick-Counters of the Rick Kind;Morty;Well, if he’s a Rick, doesn’t he just have to stand by a Morty to hide? I mean, isn’t that what Mortys are? Human cloaking devices?
1;10;Close Rick-Counters of the Rick Kind;Rick;Morty, you’re making a bigger deal out of this than it is.
1;10;Close Rick-Counters of the Rick Kind;Morty;Oh my god, Rick, look! There’s a bunch of people strapped all over that building!
1;10;Close Rick-Counters of the Rick Kind;Rick;Not people, Morty. Mortys.
1;10;Close Rick-Counters of the Rick Kind;Morty (C-137);Oh my god… wh-why would somebody do this? It’s horrible!
1;10;Close Rick-Counters of the Rick Kind;Rick;Well, one Morty’s enough to hide from the bureaucrats. But you g- you get a whole matrix of Mortys and put ‘em in agonising pain. That creates a pattern that can hide even from other Ricks, motherfucker. I fiddled with a concept like this once.
1;10;Close Rick-Counters of the Rick Kind;Rick;On paper, Morty, on paper! I wouldn’t do this, it’s barbaric overkill. I mean, you could accomplish the same result with like five Mortys and a jumper cable. Which I also wouldn’t do! I’m just saying, it’s bad craftsmanship.
1;10;Close Rick-Counters of the Rick Kind;Beth;Coffee time!
1;10;Close Rick-Counters of the Rick Kind;Jerry;Ugh.
1;10;Close Rick-Counters of the Rick Kind;Doofus Rick;Hi Jerry!
1;10;Close Rick-Counters of the Rick Kind;Jerry;Leave me alone, I’m working!
1;10;Close Rick-Counters of the Rick Kind;Doofus Rick;Oh, you are? Wh-wh-what do you do?
1;10;Close Rick-Counters of the Rick Kind;Jerry;Ugh. I’m- I’m in between advertising jobs.
1;10;Close Rick-Counters of the Rick Kind;Doofus Rick;Advertising? Wow! So, people need help figuring out what to buy and then y-you help them?
1;10;Close Rick-Counters of the Rick Kind;Jerry;W-well, it’s a little more complicated than that…
1;10;Close Rick-Counters of the Rick Kind;Doofus Rick;Well, I mean, you do it, and you seem like a guy that really has it all together!
1;10;Close Rick-Counters of the Rick Kind;Jerry;Dude, are you… wh- you’re being a dick, right?
1;10;Close Rick-Counters of the Rick Kind;Doofus Rick;Oh gosh, wh- I hope not! I-I-I-I wouldn’t want to offend you in any way!
1;10;Close Rick-Counters of the Rick Kind;Jerry;You’re really a Rick?
1;10;Close Rick-Counters of the Rick Kind;Doofus Rick;Ohoho! Y-of course I am! Just as much as my Morty’s a Morty!
1;10;Close Rick-Counters of the Rick Kind;Jerry;Hey, he looks a lot like Eric Stoltz from the movie ‘Mask.’ You know, the one with Cher in it?
1;10;Close Rick-Counters of the Rick Kind;Doofus Rick;That’s right, Jerry! He-he’s from a reality where everyone is Eric Stoltz mask people! He’s Eric Stoltz mask Morty! They assigned him to me because… I never had any kids of my own. But if I did, boy, I’d love ‘em  if they were as smart and as successful as you are, Jerry.
1;10;Close Rick-Counters of the Rick Kind;Rick 1;Hey, get a load of this! Jerry’s hanging out with doofus Rick.
1;10;Close Rick-Counters of the Rick Kind;Rick 2;Haha, this is perfect.
1;10;Close Rick-Counters of the Rick Kind;Doofus Rick;I’m not doofus Rick! I’m Rick J-19-Zeta-7!
1;10;Close Rick-Counters of the Rick Kind;Rick 1;Oh, is that the timeline where everybody eats poop? Jerry, you know this guy eats poop, right?
1;10;Close Rick-Counters of the Rick Kind;Doofus Rick;Hey! I don’t eat poop! Y-you guys are always so mean to me!
1;10;Close Rick-Counters of the Rick Kind;Doofus Rick;I guess it’s only fair to tell you now, Jerry… I’m the worst Rick of them all.
1;10;Close Rick-Counters of the Rick Kind;Jerry;According to who? Other versions of you? If I’ve learned one thing, it’s that before you get anywhere in life, you gotta stop listening to yourself.
1;10;Close Rick-Counters of the Rick Kind;Doofus Rick;Wow, you really are wise, Jerry. I-I guess that’s why you work in advertising!
1;10;Close Rick-Counters of the Rick Kind;Jerry;The fact that you feel that way makes you the best Rick of them all.
1;10;Close Rick-Counters of the Rick Kind;Morty;You don’t care about me at all! I’m no different than that jacket you’ve got on! Y-y-or-or your stupid portal gun! I’m just a tool! I-I’m just an object!
1;10;Close Rick-Counters of the Rick Kind;Rick;Hey, it’s your choice to take it personally, Morty. Now for the love of god, be quiet! The point of this is to get the drop on the guy!
1;10;Close Rick-Counters of the Rick Kind;Morty;You know what Rick, I’ll tell you something! I’m more than a human shield!
1;10;Close Rick-Counters of the Rick Kind;Rick;Yeah, that’s right! You are! You’re a perfect impenetrable sheet of human armour, Morty! Because you’re as dumb as I am smart! Which is why when I say ‘shut up’ it’s really good advice.
1;10;Close Rick-Counters of the Rick Kind;Rick;Great, nice work, Morty. Urrgh.
1;10;Close Rick-Counters of the Rick Kind;Evil Rick;Ooh, look at you, C-137! You’re- aren’t you a tough customer?
1;10;Close Rick-Counters of the Rick Kind;Rick;The slow clap? Really? Kinda played out, dude.
1;10;Close Rick-Counters of the Rick Kind;Evil Rick;Not in this dimension it isn’t. In fact, hah, I invented it and nobody else has ever even done it here before.
1;10;Close Rick-Counters of the Rick Kind;Rick;Well lah-dee-dah.
1;10;Close Rick-Counters of the Rick Kind;Evil Rick;Hey, that’s mine!
1;10;Close Rick-Counters of the Rick Kind;Rick;I don’t like the look of that Rick, Morty. We gotta escape.
1;10;Close Rick-Counters of the Rick Kind;Morty;I’m not gonna help you, Rick. Y-you’re a monster.
1;10;Close Rick-Counters of the Rick Kind;Rick;Don’t be Rickdiculous, Morty.
1;10;Close Rick-Counters of the Rick Kind;Morty;W-will you stop saying that? It’s stupid.
1;10;Close Rick-Counters of the Rick Kind;Evil Rick;Take his Morty away.
1;10;Close Rick-Counters of the Rick Kind;Evil Morty;Come with me.
1;10;Close Rick-Counters of the Rick Kind;Morty;Yeah, gladly. Geez man, Ricks huh?
1;10;Close Rick-Counters of the Rick Kind;Morty;Hey man, you seem to know how this place works. Is there any way we can… shut down that grid and rescue all those Mortys out there?
1;10;Close Rick-Counters of the Rick Kind;Evil Morty;It would be pointless. Mortys have no chance of defeating a Rick. In here.
1;10;Close Rick-Counters of the Rick Kind;Evil Rick;Ahh, isn’t it beautiful?
1;10;Close Rick-Counters of the Rick Kind;Rick;Yeah, yeah, looks like payday at Neverland ranch in here. Zing!
1;10;Close Rick-Counters of the Rick Kind;Rick;That guy got it.
1;10;Close Rick-Counters of the Rick Kind;Evil Rick;Ah-ah Rick, quiet. You’re missing my symphony.
1;10;Close Rick-Counters of the Rick Kind;Rick;Hey, I’ll take it over Mumford and Sons. Zip! This guy is on it!
1;10;Close Rick-Counters of the Rick Kind;Evil Rick;He’s not laughing at your dumb jokes, Rick. That’s just a random noise it makes every ten seconds.
1;10;Close Rick-Counters of the Rick Kind;Rick;Awww.
1;10;Close Rick-Counters of the Rick Kind;Evil Rick;See, Rick, you’re not as clever as you think you are. I wanted you to find me. We’re not so different, you and I.
1;10;Close Rick-Counters of the Rick Kind;Rick;Yeah, duh!
1;10;Close Rick-Counters of the Rick Kind;Evil Rick;See this right here, Rick? I crunched the numbers, I created a spectrum of all the Ricks. I listed ‘em out from most evil to least evil. Here’s where I am. And look at right here’s where you are, Rick. This guy right here? Super weird.
1;10;Close Rick-Counters of the Rick Kind;Rick;I get it. So you want me to team up with you to take down the council of Ricks, right? Is that where you’re going with this? ‘Cause that’s where I’d be going.
1;10;Close Rick-Counters of the Rick Kind;Evil Rick;Please. I think I’m doing pretty good on my own. I’m simply going to download the contents of your brain, and then kill you.
1;10;Close Rick-Counters of the Rick Kind;Doofus Rick;Okay, if we add a little more titanium nitrate, and just a tad of chlorified tartrate. Ovenless brownies!
1;10;Close Rick-Counters of the Rick Kind;Jerry;It’s incredible what a gifted mind can accomplish when priorities are in order!
1;10;Close Rick-Counters of the Rick Kind;Doofus Rick;Well, come on, I can’t take all the credit, Jerry. It was your idea. C’mere Jerry!
1;10;Close Rick-Counters of the Rick Kind;Jerry;Hey, uh. C’mere, uh. I-I wanna show you something.
1;10;Close Rick-Counters of the Rick Kind;Jerry;Okay, look. Everybody makes fun of me for getting these, but… you’re a genius scientist, what do you think? There’s little R2D2s where the George Washingtons should be!
1;10;Close Rick-Counters of the Rick Kind;Doofus Rick;You know Jerry, I’m not gonna tell you that these will increase in value, or even hold their current value. The truth is… you bought ‘em ‘cause you like ‘em. They have value to you. That’s what matters.
1;10;Close Rick-Counters of the Rick Kind;Jerry;How long are you staying?
1;10;Close Rick-Counters of the Rick Kind;Doofus Rick;Until we find your Rick.
1;10;Close Rick-Counters of the Rick Kind;Jerry;I found mine. I found mine.
1;10;Close Rick-Counters of the Rick Kind;Morty (C-137);Help!
1;10;Close Rick-Counters of the Rick Kind;Religious Morty;There is no escape, my son. We will find our peace in the next world.
1;10;Close Rick-Counters of the Rick Kind;Morty (C-137);So what? Y-y-y-y-you’re just going to give up?
1;10;Close Rick-Counters of the Rick Kind;Religious Morty;We’re giving in to the power of the One True Morty. One day he will return!
1;10;Close Rick-Counters of the Rick Kind;All religious Mortys;Praise the One True Morty!
1;10;Close Rick-Counters of the Rick Kind;Morty (C-137);Alright Mortys, listen up! My name is Morty Smith, from Earth dimension C-137! I know you’re scared, because I’m scared, but that’s no reason to accept our fate. We’re Mortys! We’re not defined by our relationships to Rick! Our destiny is our own!
1;10;Close Rick-Counters of the Rick Kind;Morty 1;This sounds like something the One True Morty might say. I’m sick of being a human shield! I-I-I-I wanna be a gardener!
1;10;Close Rick-Counters of the Rick Kind;Morty 2;I wanna write really crazy, intense action novels!
1;10;Close Rick-Counters of the Rick Kind;Hammer Morty;I’m more than just a hammer!
1;10;Close Rick-Counters of the Rick Kind;Religious Morty;He is the one true Morty! The one true Morty!
1;10;Close Rick-Counters of the Rick Kind;All Mortys;Hooray!
1;10;Close Rick-Counters of the Rick Kind;Lobster alien;Hey, keep it down!
1;10;Close Rick-Counters of the Rick Kind;All Mortys;Raaaaugh!
1;10;Close Rick-Counters of the Rick Kind;Evil Rick;You’ve lived quite a life, Rick. It’s a real shame you’re not gonna be around to see it through.
1;10;Close Rick-Counters of the Rick Kind;Evil Rick;You’re crying? Over a Morty?
1;10;Close Rick-Counters of the Rick Kind;Rick;No, I’m just allergic to dipshits.
1;10;Close Rick-Counters of the Rick Kind;Evil Rick;Ugh, pathetic. We both know that if there’s any truth in the universe, it’s that Ricks don’t care about Mortys.
1;10;Close Rick-Counters of the Rick Kind;Evil Rick;Do your worst, you little bastards! Kill me! Do it! Do it!
1;10;Close Rick-Counters of the Rick Kind;Rick;Morty! Get me out of this! Come on!
1;10;Close Rick-Counters of the Rick Kind;Morty (C-137);You’re lucky I’m not a Rick.
1;10;Close Rick-Counters of the Rick Kind;Rick;Point taken, but this is no time for arcs.
1;10;Close Rick-Counters of the Rick Kind;Rick 1;Yeah, hello?
1;10;Close Rick-Counters of the Rick Kind;Rick (C-137);Hey, what do me and O.J. not have in common?
1;10;Close Rick-Counters of the Rick Kind;Rick 1;Huh? Wh-who is this?
1;10;Close Rick-Counters of the Rick Kind;Rick (C-137);I found the real killer, biitch! Get over here!
1;10;Close Rick-Counters of the Rick Kind;Rick 1;Yo ding-dong! We’re done here. Time to go.
1;10;Close Rick-Counters of the Rick Kind;Doofus Rick;Well Jerry, I guess this means goodbye.
1;10;Close Rick-Counters of the Rick Kind;Jerry;W-w-well, does it have to? Heh, you, you look just like Rick. We could maybe… you know… get rid of him? I’m not saying kill him, necessarily, I-I’m also not saying necessarily not kill him, but-
1;10;Close Rick-Counters of the Rick Kind;Doofus Rick;Jerry. W-we both know it wouldn’t work. It’s time to go back to our lives. I love you, Jerry. I love ya.
1;10;Close Rick-Counters of the Rick Kind;Morty (C-137);Wh-wh-what’s gonna happen to all these Mortys?
1;10;Close Rick-Counters of the Rick Kind;Council Rick 1;They’ll go back to their families, attend school regularly, play video games, date girls… poor little Rickless bastards.
1;10;Close Rick-Counters of the Rick Kind;Council Rick 1;Earth Rick C-137, the council apologises for its false accusation. And in the way of reparations for our terrible mistake, we would like to compensate you with this voucher for a free replacement Morty, in the event that your current Morty should-
1;10;Close Rick-Counters of the Rick Kind;Rick;Uh, guys? Not a good time. Come on, Morty, let’s hit it.
1;10;Close Rick-Counters of the Rick Kind;Morty;Is it time for arcs yet, Rick? I did a pretty great job back there for a human cloaking device. Saved your ass.
1;10;Close Rick-Counters of the Rick Kind;Rick;Alright, Morty, don’t break an arm jerking yourself off.
1;10;Close Rick-Counters of the Rick Kind;Morty;Man, I can’t believe you, Rick! That right there! Tha-that was a great opportunity to show a little humanity. You know? To connect with me a little?
1;10;Close Rick-Counters of the Rick Kind;Rick;Hey Morty, you want connection? Go be part of some stupid club like all those dumb Ricks. You know, maybe I don’t connect because I’m the Rickest Rick there is. And you know, it would go without saying that the Rickest Rick… would have the Mortyest Morty.
1;10;Close Rick-Counters of the Rick Kind;Morty;It would go without saying, huh?
1;10;Close Rick-Counters of the Rick Kind;Rick;Yeah, it would. Did you hear me say it?
1;10;Close Rick-Counters of the Rick Kind;Morty;Nah… The Mortyest Morty…
1;10;Close Rick-Counters of the Rick Kind;Rick;Just don’t get too big for your loafers, Buster Brown. A cocky Morty could lead to some big problems. Could be a real bad thing for everybody.
1;10;Close Rick-Counters of the Rick Kind;Morty;Oh yeah, how’s that?
1;10;Close Rick-Counters of the Rick Kind;Rick;I-I-I’ll explain when you’re older.
1;10;Close Rick-Counters of the Rick Kind;Rick 1;What a mess…
1;10;Close Rick-Counters of the Rick Kind;Rick 2;Pride cometh before the fall. I guess he got what he deserved.
1;10;Close Rick-Counters of the Rick Kind;Rick 1;What is that?
1;10;Close Rick-Counters of the Rick Kind;Rick 2;Hand me the laser defibrillator.
1;10;Close Rick-Counters of the Rick Kind;Doofus Rick;Hey guys! Uh, c-can I help?
1;10;Close Rick-Counters of the Rick Kind;Rick 2;No! Go clean the toilets! Maybe you’ll make friends with some turds!
1;10;Close Rick-Counters of the Rick Kind;Rick 1;You make us ashamed to be ourselves!
1;10;Close Rick-Counters of the Rick Kind;Rick 1;My god! I’ve seen this technology before! This Rick was being controlled remotely, puppeteered by somebody else. This is the receiver!
1;10;Close Rick-Counters of the Rick Kind;Rick 2;Yeah, but where’s the transmitter?
1;10;Close Rick-Counters of the Rick Kind;Rick;Wubbalubbadubdub! Oh. Hey Jerry. Wh-wh-what are you doing in my room, buddy?
1;10;Close Rick-Counters of the Rick Kind;Jerry;Nothing! I was just, um, checking the smoke detectors.
1;10;Close Rick-Counters of the Rick Kind;Rick;Alright. Okay, get out.
1;10;Close Rick-Counters of the Rick Kind;Rick;What’s that dipshit doing out there? Are you friends with him? You know he eats his own shit, right? Oh my god, this is rich! I’ve got like ten Ricks to call right now!
1;11;Ricksy Business;Summer;Bye, mom! Bye, dad!
1;11;Ricksy Business;Morty;Drive carefully!
1;11;Ricksy Business;Rick;Have fun, you two.
1;11;Ricksy Business;Beth;Yes, we will have as much fun as possible on our... Titanic-themed getaway.
1;11;Ricksy Business;Jerry;Let's lose the 'tude, please. It's supposed to be romantic.
1;11;Ricksy Business;Beth;Speaking of disasters, dad, we are leaving you in charge, here.
1;11;Ricksy Business;Rick;I know, c-can we wrap this up? Morty and I have some synthetic laser-eels oxidizing in the garage.
1;11;Ricksy Business;Beth;Hey, don't blow me off. I am drawing a line, okay? Any damage to this house or these children when we get back, and... no more adventures with Morty.
1;11;Ricksy Business;Morty;Aw, geez, Rick! If my mom's the one who's saying it, then you know it's pretty serious this time.
1;11;Ricksy Business;Beth;That's right.
1;11;Ricksy Business;Jerry;That's right. Wait... What?
1;11;Ricksy Business;Rick;"Listen, you have my word as a caregiver, everything's gonna be fine. And if not, like you say, no more adventures or whatever. It's like that old song blomp blomp-a noop noop a-noop noop noop"". You guys know that song? From Tiny Roger's? You never heard of it? You know"
1;11;Ricksy Business;Rick;No-nobody? A-all right, whatever. Look, who cares? Just go on your stupid trip.
1;11;Ricksy Business;Jerry;Not one thing out of place. Not a single thing.
1;11;Ricksy Business;Summer;Well, we're past the point of no return. I'm going to have a party.
1;11;Ricksy Business;Summer;I found Jello.
1;11;Ricksy Business;Summer;Can you sneak your mom's vodka? Yes, she does. I saw it in your laundry room. Listen, you can't both be in denial about it. Okay, bye.
1;11;Ricksy Business;Morty;Summer, you can't throw a party! Remember what mom said?
1;11;Ricksy Business;Summer;Yeah, if anything gets messed up, you and grandpa Rick get punished. I'm only a human being, Morty.
1;11;Ricksy Business;Morty;Rick, tell Summer she can't have a party!
1;11;Ricksy Business;Rick;Uh, Summer, you can't have a party.
1;11;Ricksy Business;Summer;Ugh.
1;11;Ricksy Business;Rick;Because I'm having a party, b-I-I-I-itch!
1;11;Ricksy Business;Morty;Oh, what?! Rick, you can't!
1;11;Ricksy Business;Summer;What do you mean you're having a party? Are some glip glops from the third dimension going to come over and play cards or something?
1;11;Ricksy Business;Rick;"Glip glop?"" You're lucky a Traflorkian doesn't hear you say that."""
1;11;Ricksy Business;Summer;Is that like their n-word?
1;11;Ricksy Business;Rick;It's like the n-word and the c-word had a baby, and it was raised by all the bad words for Jews.
1;11;Ricksy Business;Morty;Listen, I think the three of us could just, you know, have a nice time, like just hanging out, and, you know, doing a little bonding and --
1;11;Ricksy Business;Summer;Screw that. This is my chance to gain some footing with the cool kids.
1;11;Ricksy Business;Rick;That's why you party? Boy, you really are 17.
1;11;Ricksy Business;Summer;Why do you party?
1;11;Ricksy Business;Rick;To get wr-wriggedy wriggedy wrecked, son!
1;11;Ricksy Business;Summer;Just keep your sci-fi friends away from my awesome ones.
1;11;Ricksy Business;Rick;Yeah, and you keep your awesome friends away from my canapes.
1;11;Ricksy Business;Tour Guide;After dinner, Titanic 2 will attach to the rail system near our replica iceberg, and the hydraulics encased in these tubes will execute a controlled sink into the icy depths.
1;11;Ricksy Business;Jerry;A rail system seems archaic for an attraction this impressive. Are you sure the ship will sink?
1;11;Ricksy Business;Tour Guide;I can assure you the ship will sink, as it has a thousand times before. It is un-unsinkable.
1;11;Ricksy Business;Jerry;Ooh! Look, it's the line for the bow!
1;11;Ricksy Business;Beth;Jerry, I'd love to just kick back with a Margarita and read.
1;11;Ricksy Business;Beth;"Do you mind if I skip the whole king of the world"" bit?"""
1;11;Ricksy Business;Jerry;"Well, it's not the king of the world"" bit. That's Jack and fabrizio. This is where rose says"
1;11;Ricksy Business;Beth;Well, what about her?
1;11;Ricksy Business;Beth;Excuse me, ma'am. Would you like to take my place in line?
1;11;Ricksy Business;Lucy;I, uh -- I could get into trouble.
1;11;Ricksy Business;Beth;We won't tell.
1;11;Ricksy Business;Jerry;So... You're a Titanic fanatic?
1;11;Ricksy Business;Lucy;Oh, yes. I've worked here since it opened, but I've never been able to participate.
1;11;Ricksy Business;Jerry;Happy to help... rose.
1;11;Ricksy Business;Tammy;I love watching bukkake. I mean, like, I don't know if I personally would ever do it...
1;11;Ricksy Business;Summer;Brad! Hey!
1;11;Ricksy Business;Brad;Yo.
1;11;Ricksy Business;Tammy;Brad is here! Quick, make my hair look drunk.
1;11;Ricksy Business;Brad;Check it out. Tammy's already drunk. Cool.
1;11;Ricksy Business;Birdperson;The beacon was activated. Who is in danger?
1;11;Ricksy Business;Summer;Ugh! Grandpa!
1;11;Ricksy Business;Rick;Birdperson!
1;11;Ricksy Business;Birdperson;I am pleased there is no emergency.
1;11;Ricksy Business;Rick;Oh, there's an emergency, all right. A pussy emergency! When's the last time you got laid, 'pers?
1;11;Ricksy Business;Birdperson;It has been a... challenging mating season for birdperson.
1;11;Ricksy Business;Rick;Then it's time to get your beak wet tonight, playah. Go have some fun out there birdp-- bird-- birdperson.
1;11;Ricksy Business;Morty;Oh, man, how many people did you invite, Rick?
1;11;Ricksy Business;Rick;Uh... people? Mm, six.
1;11;Ricksy Business;Rick;Yo! What up, my glip glops?!
1;11;Ricksy Business;Morty;Oh, man!
1;11;Ricksy Business;Morty;Oh! Y-y-you know there's a garbage, right?
1;11;Ricksy Business;Morty;Hey, uh, what the hell?!
1;11;Ricksy Business;Jelly-like creature;Ooh. That's why you never invite a floopy doop and a shmoopy doop to the same party.
1;11;Ricksy Business;Morty;Oh, oh, g-- oh, that's disgusting! You guys are in my parents' bed!
1;11;Ricksy Business;Blue alien;Oh. Sorry. I'm not feeling too well. I just needed to lie down for a bit.
1;11;Ricksy Business;Morty;Oh. Okay. S-s-sorry. Haha.
1;11;Ricksy Business;Morty;Oh, my God! Are you kidding me?!
1;11;Ricksy Business;Gearhead;The thing people don't realize about the Gear Wars is that it was never really about the gears at all.
1;11;Ricksy Business;Rick;Uh-huh. Yeah. No, no, to-totally.
1;11;Ricksy Business;Morty;Rick, you got to stop --
1;11;Ricksy Business;Rick;Morty! Have you met Gearhead?
1;11;Ricksy Business;Morty;Hey, how's it --
1;11;Ricksy Business;Rick;Morty here, he -- he would love to hear all about the Gear Wars.
1;11;Ricksy Business;Gearhead;How familiar are you with the Gear Wars, exactly?
1;11;Ricksy Business;Morty;Uh... Not at all.
1;11;Ricksy Business;Gearhead;Oh, boy. I envy you. Okay, it was about 754 years ago...
1;11;Ricksy Business;Rick;Oh, hey, Morty! H-have you -- have you met my buddy scropon?
1;11;Ricksy Business;Morty;Not again, Rick. That last guy droned on for 20 minutes, you know? And meanwhile, the whole house is being destroyed!
1;11;Ricksy Business;Rick;Whoa, Morty, this guy's entire planet was destroyed.
1;11;Ricksy Business;Rick;Have a little perspective.
1;11;Ricksy Business;Squanchy;Hey, Rick, squanchy party, bro!
1;11;Ricksy Business;Rick;Aw! Squanchy!
1;11;Ricksy Business;Squanchy;Is there a good place for me to squanch around here?
1;11;Ricksy Business;Rick;Squanchy, you can squanch wherever you want, man. Mi casa es su casa, dawg!
1;11;Ricksy Business;Squanchy;All right! I like your squanch!
1;11;Ricksy Business;Morty;"Uh, Rick, what exactly is squanching""?"""
1;11;Ricksy Business;Rick;Morty, listen -- we've had a lot of really cool adventures over the last year, but it's time to relax.
1;11;Ricksy Business;Morty;Yeah, if I relax now, there might not even be any more adventures!
1;11;Ricksy Business;Rick;Jesus, Morty, you're bumming me out. Can't we just pretend like everything's fine for a few hours, enjoy ourselves, and then worry about all this later?
1;11;Ricksy Business;Morty;Yeah, that's easy for you to say, Rick. You know, you like not caring about stuff. You know, wh-wh-what's in this for me?
1;11;Ricksy Business;Morty;Jessica.
1;11;Ricksy Business;Rick;Knock it off, Slow Mobius!
1;11;Ricksy Business;Slow Mobius;Ha ha! Sorry, dude! I'm just trying to show off my powers, bro!
1;11;Ricksy Business;Morty;I can't believe she's here.
1;11;Ricksy Business;Rick;Well, what are you doing standing here, Morty? Go. Talk to her.
1;11;Ricksy Business;Rick;Tonight, the only adventure you're on is your cusping manhood.
1;11;Ricksy Business;Jerry;Oh, Rose.
1;11;Ricksy Business;Lucy;Whee!
1;11;Ricksy Business;Jerry;Is that what I think it is?
1;11;Ricksy Business;Lucy;Yes, every couple gets to re-create Jack's drowning at the end of the movie.
1;11;Ricksy Business;Lucy;It's so romantic.
1;11;Ricksy Business;Jerry;I can't wait to do that with Beth.
1;11;Ricksy Business;Lucy;I don't know, Jerry. With all due respect, it seems like your wife may not be that interested.
1;11;Ricksy Business;Jerry;Look!
1;11;Ricksy Business;Voice through speaker;Iceberg, right ahead! The buffet is now closed.
1;11;Ricksy Business;Captain #1;Uh, sir? There's not a problem.
1;11;Ricksy Business;Captain #2;What do you mean there's not a problem?
1;11;Ricksy Business;Captain #1;The guidance system isn't putting us on a direct collision course. This ship is about to completely miss the giant iceberg!
1;11;Ricksy Business;Captain #2;Well, do something! Steer into it!
1;11;Ricksy Business;Captain #1;I'm trying!
1;11;Ricksy Business;Captain #2;It's too late. Ladies and gentlemen... Don't brace yourselves.
1;11;Ricksy Business;Jerry;No! What happened?!
1;11;Ricksy Business;Lucy;Their rail system must have failed.
1;11;Ricksy Business;Passengers;Oh, my God! We're not gonna sink! What are we gonna do?!
1;11;Ricksy Business;Guy;Totally gonna get laid tonight.
1;11;Ricksy Business;Tammy;I like your feathers.
1;11;Ricksy Business;Birdperson;They are designed to attract the attention of the female.
1;11;Ricksy Business;Tammy;It's working.
1;11;Ricksy Business;Birdperson;Tammy, I should let you know I just got out of a highly intense soul bond with my previous spirit mate.
1;11;Ricksy Business;Tammy;I'm not looking to get into a soul bond. I'm just looking for...
1;11;Ricksy Business;Birdperson;I believe birdperson can arrange that.
1;11;Ricksy Business;Nancy;Hey, Summer, haven't seen you at flute practice in a while.
1;11;Ricksy Business;Girl;Summer, don't tell me you're friends with her.
1;11;Ricksy Business;Summer;Are you kidding me? I don't even know what she's doing here.
1;11;Ricksy Business;Rick;Whoa. Not cool, summer. This is a party. Everybody should be welcome. Oh, great. Who invited Abradolph Lincoler?
1;11;Ricksy Business;Summer;I thought everyone was welcome.
1;11;Ricksy Business;Rick;It's not the same, Summer. Lincoler is a crazed maniac -- just a misguided effort of mine to create a morally neutral superleader by combining the DNA of Adolf Hitler and Abraham Lincoln. Turns out it just adds up to a lame, weird loser.
1;11;Ricksy Business;Abradolph Lincoler;Rick, you brought me into this world, a suffering abomination tortured by the duality of its being. But I shall finally know peace when I watch the life drain from your wretched body!
1;11;Ricksy Business;Brad;Whoa. What's up, man?
1;11;Ricksy Business;Abradolph Lincoler;I have no quarrel with you, boy.
1;11;Ricksy Business;Brad;"Boy""? What's that supposed to mean?"""
1;11;Ricksy Business;Abradolph Lincoler;It's just -- l-look, I-I don't know how you thought I meant it, but...
1;11;Ricksy Business;Rick;Don't look at me, dude.
1;11;Ricksy Business;Abradolph Lincoler;Look, I'm half-Abraham Lincoln, so --
1;11;Ricksy Business;Brad;So I should get on my knees and kiss your ass?!
1;11;Ricksy Business;Abradolph Lincoler;Well, no, but... You know?
1;11;Ricksy Business;Brad;What do I know? That the third reich will reign for a thousand years?
1;11;Ricksy Business;Jessica;Leave him alone, Brad.
1;11;Ricksy Business;Brad;Stay out of this, Jessica!
1;11;Ricksy Business;Rick;Kick his ass, Brad!
1;11;Ricksy Business;All;Kick his ass! Kick his ass! Kick his ass!
1;11;Ricksy Business;Jessica;Brad!
1;11;Ricksy Business;Morty;Rick!
1;11;Ricksy Business;Rick;I just did you a favor, Morty.
1;11;Ricksy Business;Morty;Sorry about all that. Rick has some really strange friends.
1;11;Ricksy Business;Jessica;Ugh! Brad is such a jerk. He's always trying to prove what a man he is. I just want to find somebody nice and sweet.
1;11;Ricksy Business;Morty;Jessica, can I show you something?
1;11;Ricksy Business;Jessica;Wow! Look at all this stuff.
1;11;Ricksy Business;Morty;Yeah. This is me and my grandpa Rick's Sci-Fi workshop. Check this out.
1;11;Ricksy Business;Jessica;It's beautiful.
1;11;Ricksy Business;Morty;You know, Jessica, there's something I've always wanted to tell you.
1;11;Ricksy Business;Jessica;What's that, Morty?
1;11;Ricksy Business;Morty;I think that you're the most --
1;11;Ricksy Business;Jessica;No, that -- those weird sounds coming from the closet over there. Aah!
1;11;Ricksy Business;Morty;Oh, my God!
1;11;Ricksy Business;Squanchy;Hey, I'm squanching in here!
1;11;Ricksy Business;Morty;Oh, my God! Oh, that is so disgusting!
1;11;Ricksy Business;Morty;Ow! Oh! Oh, crap!
1;11;Ricksy Business;Rick;Huh. Big star in the sky. Oxygen-rich atmosphere. Giant testicle monsters. We'll be fine! Let's party!
1;11;Ricksy Business;Summer;I swear to God, Morty, if it weren't for the fact that everyone's still having a blast in there, I would be so furious with you right now.
1;11;Ricksy Business;Rick;Oh, man. Y-you hear that, Morty? You really lucked out with Summer o-on that one.
1;11;Ricksy Business;Morty;How are you guys not freaking out right now?! T-the whole house is sitting in another dimension! I-I mean, w-what the hell are we supposed to do?! M-m-mom and dad are gonna kill us! I'm losing it here, Rick!
1;11;Ricksy Business;Rick;Relax, Morty, rela-a-a-ax! It's gonna be fine. All we have to do is go out and find us some kalaxian crystals. Oh, shit, motherfucker! Kalaxian crystals, Morty, just a few miles South of here.
1;11;Ricksy Business;Morty;Okay. Let's go, then.
1;11;Ricksy Business;Morty;W-w-we got to go get those crystals right now, Rick.
1;11;Ricksy Business;Rick;Whoa, whoa, whoa. Morty, Morty, I-I can't go with you. I got to hang back and make sure everything stays cool here, you know? I mean, who knows what -- what if somebody breaks something?
1;11;Ricksy Business;Summer;Yeah. Me too. I should stay.
1;11;Ricksy Business;Abradolph Lincoler;You guys have any aspirin?
1;11;Ricksy Business;Rick;Oh, hey, Morty, this is perfect! You can take Lincoler with you.
1;11;Ricksy Business;Abradolph Lincoler;Hey, man, I'm not going anywhere. I'm injured.
1;11;Ricksy Business;Rick;Shut up, Lincoler. It's the least you can do for wrecking the living room.
1;11;Ricksy Business;Summer;Yeah! And, Nancy, you should go, too.
1;11;Ricksy Business;Nancy;What? Why -- why me?
1;11;Ricksy Business;Summer;Because, uh, you're -- you're so good at playing the flute.
1;11;Ricksy Business;Captain #2;Sorry for the inconvenience, folks. We should resume sinking shortly. In the meantime, please, stay on the ship and enjoy a complimentary plate of James Cameronion rings.
1;11;Ricksy Business;Jerry;Great. Not only is the ship not sinking, but now the fourth wall has been broken.
1;11;Ricksy Business;Beth;I am gonna go back to the room to finish my book. You should find that Lucy woman.
1;11;Ricksy Business;Jerry;But -- but --
1;11;Ricksy Business;Lucy;You see, Jerry? May I show you something?
1;11;Ricksy Business;Lucy;Had everything gone as planned, this entire area would be underwater.
1;11;Ricksy Business;Jerry;"I would have liked to see it. This trip has been a Titanic"" failure. Get it?"""
1;11;Ricksy Business;Jerry;Ooh!
1;11;Ricksy Business;Lucy;Draw me, Jerry.
1;11;Ricksy Business;Jerry;Oh, boy. Lucy, wow. Uh, this isn't what I had in mind.
1;11;Ricksy Business;Lucy;But it's the perfect moment. We've been dreaming about this for 16 years.
1;11;Ricksy Business;Jerry;Um, not like this. Not -- not with you. Heh.
1;11;Ricksy Business;Lucy;You are gonna draw me.
1;11;Ricksy Business;Jerry;Aah!
1;11;Ricksy Business;Lucy;Then you're going to fuck me in that car over there.
1;11;Ricksy Business;Abradolph Lincoler;It's weird, 'cause I definitely think that all men are created equal. But, at the same time --
1;11;Ricksy Business;Morty;Okay! Um, the crystals should be really close.
1;11;Ricksy Business;Nancy;There they are!
1;11;Ricksy Business;Abradolph Lincoler;Wait. Something's not right.
1;11;Ricksy Business;Abradolph Lincoler;Get the crystals! I'll handle the beast! Prepare to be emancipated from your own inferior genes!
1;11;Ricksy Business;Nancy;Summer's gonna like me again.
1;11;Ricksy Business;Morty;Lincoler, come on! Let's get out of here!
1;11;Ricksy Business;Abradolph Lincoler;Mein journey is over, Morty. I have something important to tell you.
1;11;Ricksy Business;Gearhead;And the gears, they turned for a thousand years, until the dark day that they stopped.
1;11;Ricksy Business;Morty;Rick, I got them! I got the crystals!
1;11;Ricksy Business;Rick;All right! You did it, Morty.
1;11;Ricksy Business;Morty;Rick, wait! There's something you need to know. I couldn't have done it without Lincoler. He said that he was really sorry and that he loves you like a father.
1;11;Ricksy Business;Morty;He only wanted you to accept him, and he hopes that his final act would redeem him in your eyes. He sacrificed himself to save all of us, Rick. He died.
1;11;Ricksy Business;Rick;Well, at least he didn't die in vain. He got these crystals. And these babies just saved this lame-ass party! Wubba, lubba, dub, dub! Play something. Somebody, play something.
1;11;Ricksy Business;Morty;Wait a minute. What?
1;11;Ricksy Business;Rick;Put your right foot forward, and your left foot back, then fucking slide around like on a nordictrack...
1;11;Ricksy Business;Rick;Move to the left, step to the right, wiggle your elbows, and look up into the light...
1;11;Ricksy Business;Song;It's the, it's the, it's the Rick dance. It's the, it's the, it's the Rick dance...
1;11;Ricksy Business;Rick;Slow Mobius, hit me with the clock beam!
1;11;Ricksy Business;Song;It's the, it's the, it's the Rick dance.
1;11;Ricksy Business;Rick;That's the Rick dance! All right! Whoa, man!
1;11;Ricksy Business;Morty;What the hell was that?! I thought those crystals were supposed to help us get home or something!
1;11;Ricksy Business;Rick;What? No, no, no. I can get us home whenever I want to. But, listen, speaking of those crystals, can I get the rest of them? I'm starting to come down, Morty. Crystal kalaxian is a really strong, but fleeting high.
1;11;Ricksy Business;Morty;That's what I think of your crystals, Rick!
1;11;Ricksy Business;Rick;Oh, Morty, you idiot! Does anybody else have any more k-lax? B-birdperson?
1;11;Ricksy Business;Rick;Uh, squanchy?
1;11;Ricksy Business;Squanchy;Don't squaunch at me.
1;11;Ricksy Business;Morty;All right, everybody, party is officially over! Rick, take us home now.
1;11;Ricksy Business;Rick;All right, all right, fine, Morty, you party pooper buzzkill! Boo, boo! Morty sucks!
1;11;Ricksy Business;Tammy;Boo! You suck, whatever your name is.
1;11;Ricksy Business;All;Boo!
1;11;Ricksy Business;Rick;Morty, you're the worst, Morty.
1;11;Ricksy Business;Gearhead;But these gears just started turnin'.
1;11;Ricksy Business;Lucy;Almost finished, Jerry?
1;11;Ricksy Business;Jerry;Uh, almost. I haven't quite captured your beautiful eyes.
1;11;Ricksy Business;Lucy;I'm sure it's good enough. Move!
1;11;Ricksy Business;Lucy;Every weekend, Jacks and Roses have their Titanic experience in this car, and I have to mop it up. The floor drops out to make it easier. But now it's my turn. We're going to get it nice and steamy in there, and I'm going to slam my hand on the steam and leave a nice handprint, and then you're going to love inside of me.
1;11;Ricksy Business;Lucy;No mess. No clean.
1;11;Ricksy Business;Jerry;Beth!
1;11;Ricksy Business;Beth;Bet you're glad I think kindles are dumb now.
1;11;Ricksy Business;Beth;I can't help but feel a little guilty. I didn't peg Lucy for a rapist.
1;11;Ricksy Business;Jerry;What does a rapist look like exactly, Beth? Is it a slavic man wearing a denim jacket with a patchy beard and the scent of cheap champagne wafting over his blister-pocked lips?
1;11;Ricksy Business;Beth;What?
1;11;Ricksy Business;Beth;Well, at least you got all this free stuff.
1;11;Ricksy Business;Beth;Should be enough to satisfy your Titanic Jones for a while.
1;11;Ricksy Business;Jerry;Ugh! I'm not going to fit. Beth, listen to me. You're going to get out of here. You're gonna go on, and --
1;11;Ricksy Business;Beth;Jerry, just leave the door.
1;11;Ricksy Business;Jerry;It's not a door, Beth. It's debris.
1;11;Ricksy Business;Beth;I don't care. Just leave it.
1;11;Ricksy Business;Jerry;Yeah. Okay.
1;11;Ricksy Business;Lucy;"Ahahahah! Cape fear""! Hahahaha! ""Cape fear""! I'm -- I'm doing -- I'm -- I'm going to do like from ""cape fear""."""
1;11;Ricksy Business;Squanchy;Hey, squanchers! The party's squanching on at my place!
1;11;Ricksy Business;Summer;Cool. I'm coming, too.
1;11;Ricksy Business;Squanchy;Uh, no. You're not squanchy enough for a squanchy party.
1;11;Ricksy Business;Summer;What?
1;11;Ricksy Business;Squanchy;Nancy told us what a bitch you are.
1;11;Ricksy Business;Summer;Guys, seriously. Nancy?
1;11;Ricksy Business;Nancy;Summer, you're a bad person. All you care about is having popular people like you. That's not what Abradolph Lincoler stood for. Well, I-it was hard to pin down what he stood for, but it's certainly not what he died for.
1;11;Ricksy Business;Summer;Next time I party, I'm just gonna focus on getting totally wrecked. You're so wise.
1;11;Ricksy Business;Rick;Hmm, yeah. Mhh mhm...
1;11;Ricksy Business;Birdperson;May I assist you with that?
1;11;Ricksy Business;Morty;Uh, sure, yeah. Thanks.
1;11;Ricksy Business;Birdperson;"Morty, do you know what wubba lubba dub dub"" means?"""
1;11;Ricksy Business;Morty;Uh, that's just Rick's stupid nonsense catchphrase.
1;11;Ricksy Business;Birdperson;"It's not nonsense at all. In my people's tongue, it means, I am in great pain. Please help me."""""
1;11;Ricksy Business;Morty;Well, I got news for you. He's saying it ironically.
1;11;Ricksy Business;Birdperson;No, Morty. Your grandfather is, indeed, in very deep pain. That is why he must numb himself.
1;11;Ricksy Business;Morty;Come on, um...
1;11;Ricksy Business;Birdperson;Birdperson.
1;11;Ricksy Business;Morty;Come on, Birdperson. Rick's not that complicated. He's just a huge asshole.
1;11;Ricksy Business;Birdperson;Then why do you care so much if you are no longer allowed to continue on your adventures together? It appears fate has presented you with an opportunity to free yourself of Rick forever.
1;11;Ricksy Business;Morty;You know what? You're right. I shouldn't even care. This is probably the best thing that could have happened to me.
1;11;Ricksy Business;Morty;I'm sick of having adventures with Rick.
1;11;Ricksy Business;Birdperson;"My people have another saying-- gubba nub nub doo rah kah"". It means"
1;11;Ricksy Business;Summer;Guys, mom and dad are, like, right around the corner.
1;11;Ricksy Business;Birdperson;This is your moment, Morty. Choose wisely. Tammy!
1;11;Ricksy Business;Summer;Wow. We are so screwed.
1;11;Ricksy Business;Morty;Rick, wake up.
1;11;Ricksy Business;Rick;Huh? What? Wait? What? What? Stop.
1;11;Ricksy Business;Morty;Rick, you got to do something quick. My parents are home.
1;11;Ricksy Business;Rick;Augh. Uh, all -- all right. All right. Hold -- hold on. Ahh! So good.
1;11;Ricksy Business;Morty;Oh, my God. They're walking up the driveway.
1;11;Ricksy Business;Rick;Bring me the thing.
1;11;Ricksy Business;Morty;What -- what thing?
1;11;Ricksy Business;Rick;The thing. The thing. The -- the -- it's got, like, buttons on it and lights on it. It -- it -- it beeps.
1;11;Ricksy Business;Morty;Rick! That describes everything in your garage!
1;11;Ricksy Business;Summer;Do you mean this?
1;11;Ricksy Business;Rick;Summer for for the win.
1;11;Ricksy Business;Rick;All right, that should do it.
1;11;Ricksy Business;Morty;Whoa! What did you do?
1;11;Ricksy Business;Rick;Uh, s-see for yourself.
1;11;Ricksy Business;Summer;Whoa!
1;11;Ricksy Business;Rick;Yeah, e-everything's frozen in time. Yeah, and slow mobius thinks he's all that.
1;11;Ricksy Business;Morty;For how long?
1;11;Ricksy Business;Rick;I don't know. How long do you guys want? A week? A month?
1;11;Ricksy Business;Summer;Can we start cleaning the house and see how we feel?
1;11;Ricksy Business;Rick;Worst movie ever.
1;11;Ricksy Business;Summer;Dumb.
1;11;Ricksy Business;Morty;Ooh, boy, what a waste of time.
1;11;Ricksy Business;Morty;Get it? You know, 'cause it's frozen.
1;11;Ricksy Business;Summer;This has been so much fun.
1;11;Ricksy Business;Morty;"Hey, Rick. You know, this whole time, I haven't once heard you say that wubba lubba dub dub"" thing that you usually say."""
1;11;Ricksy Business;Rick;Don't need to. I have a new catchphrase.
1;11;Ricksy Business;Morty;Oh, yeah? What -- what's that, Rick?
1;11;Ricksy Business;Rick;Love my grandkids.
1;11;Ricksy Business;Morty;Aww.
1;11;Ricksy Business;Summer;Aww.
1;11;Ricksy Business;Rick;"Psych! Just kidding -- my new catchphrase is, I don't give a fuck""."""
1;11;Ricksy Business;Rick;"That's the end, motherfucker! I don't give a fuck"" is my new catchphrase! Fuck you! That's season one! Boom! Season one up in your face"
1;11;Ricksy Business;Abradolph Lincoler;Revenge.
1;11;Ricksy Business;Abradolph Lincoler;What?!
1;11;Ricksy Business;Shirtless guy;Party!
1;11;Ricksy Business;Shirtless guy;Whoo, baby!
1;11;Ricksy Business;Abradolph Lincoler;Please, stop!
1;11;Ricksy Business;Shirtless Guy;Hey, brah!
1;11;Ricksy Business;Abradolph Lincoler;I don't understand. Are you enjoying this? Do you like this?
1;11;Ricksy Business;Shirtless Guy;Yeah, you know it, dawg! Whoo, baby!
