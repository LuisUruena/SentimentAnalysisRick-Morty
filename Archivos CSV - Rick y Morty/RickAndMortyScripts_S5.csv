5;1;Mort Dinner Rick Andre;Morty;C'mon, Rick. We're -- We're almost there.
5;1;Mort Dinner Rick Andre;Rick;Ugh, leave me, Morty. It's the only way. 
5;1;Mort Dinner Rick Andre;Rick;Wha-- Were -- Wha-- Were we -- Were we Blades in that one? That's fucking tight.
5;1;Mort Dinner Rick Andre;Morty;Just stay with me.
5;1;Mort Dinner Rick Andre;Rick;I'm -- I'm scared, Morty. I can see the end. I'm a silly man. I'm a silly small man. I'm -- I'm sorry I got you into this.
5;1;Mort Dinner Rick Andre;Morty;Then how about I get us outta this?
5;1;Mort Dinner Rick Andre;Jessica;Hello?
5;1;Mort Dinner Rick Andre;Morty;Hey, Jessica. I-It's Morty. From school.
5;1;Mort Dinner Rick Andre;Jessica;Oh, hey, Morty. What's up?
5;1;Mort Dinner Rick Andre;Morty;Um, I just want to say that you're really great. I know the timing never really worked out with us, but you're really great and I wish I got to know you better.
5;1;Mort Dinner Rick Andre;Jessica;Oh, I mean -- That's a lot.
5;1;Mort Dinner Rick Andre;Morty;Oh, uh, yeah, sorry, I guess I just -- 
5;1;Mort Dinner Rick Andre;Jessica;No, I just wish you said it sooner.
5;1;Mort Dinner Rick Andre;Morty;Wh-What?
5;1;Mort Dinner Rick Andre;Jessica;Yeah, I mean, being nervous is sort of selfish sometimes, y'know?
5;1;Mort Dinner Rick Andre;Ship Voice;Life support systems failing.
5;1;Mort Dinner Rick Andre;Morty;Yeah, that's a great point.
5;1;Mort Dinner Rick Andre;Jessica;Well, what are you doing tonight?
5;1;Mort Dinner Rick Andre;Morty;Tonight?
5;1;Mort Dinner Rick Andre;Jessica;Yeah. Do you, like, want to watch a movie or something?
5;1;Mort Dinner Rick Andre;Morty;Um, yeah. Tonight. Sounds great. Holy shit! Holy shit! Come on, come on!
5;1;Mort Dinner Rick Andre;Rick;Oh. Where are we?
5;1;Mort Dinner Rick Andre;Morty;We're home, Rick. I-I landed us in the ocean.
5;1;Mort Dinner Rick Andre;Rick;The ocean?! The ocean on Earth?!
5;1;Mort Dinner Rick Andre;Morty;Uh, yeah, I-I guess so.
5;1;Mort Dinner Rick Andre;Rick;Oh, shit. Holy shit. We have to go. We have to go right fucking now.
5;1;Mort Dinner Rick Andre;Morty;What?
5;1;Mort Dinner Rick Andre;Rick;You touched the ocean, Morty.
5;1;Mort Dinner Rick Andre;Morty;What's the big --
5;1;Mort Dinner Rick Andre;Rick;Oh, fuck! Shit! Shit! 
5;1;Mort Dinner Rick Andre;Morty;What?
5;1;Mort Dinner Rick Andre;Mr. Nimbus;Richard! You have desecrated the sacred treaty betwixt land and sea. Now face the wrath of your once and eternal foe -- Mr. Nimbus!
5;1;Mort Dinner Rick Andre;Morty;Sorry. Who is that?
5;1;Mort Dinner Rick Andre;Rick;My nemesis.
5;1;Mort Dinner Rick Andre;Morty;What?
5;1;Mort Dinner Rick Andre;Rick;My fucking nemesis, okay?
5;1;Mort Dinner Rick Andre;Morty;Okay, but what was his name again?
5;1;Mort Dinner Rick Andre;Mr. Nimbus;I am Mr. Nimbus!
5;1;Mort Dinner Rick Andre;Rick;He's gonna say that a lot.
5;1;Mort Dinner Rick Andre;Beth;W-Wait, so who is coming over again?
5;1;Mort Dinner Rick Andre;Morty;He said his nemesis?
5;1;Mort Dinner Rick Andre;Jerry;Rick has a nemesis?
5;1;Mort Dinner Rick Andre;Morty;I guess.
5;1;Mort Dinner Rick Andre;Beth;Has he mentioned him before?
5;1;Mort Dinner Rick Andre;Morty;I-I was gonna ask you. First I'm hearing it.
5;1;Mort Dinner Rick Andre;Jerry;Who is he? Like a magic guy? Rick's science and he's magic? 
5;1;Mort Dinner Rick Andre;Morty;He's like a-a fish?
5;1;Mort Dinner Rick Andre;Jerry;A fish.
5;1;Mort Dinner Rick Andre;Rick;He's not a fish. He's Mr. Nimbus. He's king of the ocean and he's a piece of shit. 
5;1;Mort Dinner Rick Andre;Rick;Are you happy, Morty? Are you happy you touched the ocean? He's gonna be here any minute. Just help me smooth this over or this guy's gonna become more trouble than he's worth.
5;1;Mort Dinner Rick Andre;Morty;Um, hey, I don't know how much I can help out tonight, Rick. Jessica's coming over j-just to, like, watch a movie or something, but y'know, t-t-that's a good step. That's a solid step to something, y'know?
5;1;Mort Dinner Rick Andre;Rick;Truly nobody cares about your dick, Morty. The sooner you learn that, the better.
5;1;Mort Dinner Rick Andre;Morty;I think you just don't want me happy 'cause then I'll stop doing your crazy chores.
5;1;Mort Dinner Rick Andre;Rick;Trust me, after that ocean fuck-up, you don't get to do anything crazy. While I bullshit my way through this peace summit treaty with Nimbus, Summer is gonna dive into the Marianas Trench to recover the forbidden shell that gives him his power, because Summer can be trusted.
5;1;Mort Dinner Rick Andre;Summer;Let's lick tits.
5;1;Mort Dinner Rick Andre;Jerry;Okay, what?
5;1;Mort Dinner Rick Andre;Beth;I don't love that.
5;1;Mort Dinner Rick Andre;Summer;Of course you don't, 'cause you guys aren't getting any.
5;1;Mort Dinner Rick Andre;Beth;Actually, your father and I have been very sex-positive lately.
5;1;Mort Dinner Rick Andre;Summer;Eww.
5;1;Mort Dinner Rick Andre;Beth;Dr. Wong suggested we experiment.
5;1;Mort Dinner Rick Andre;Jerry;We've been watching pornography. Together.
5;1;Mort Dinner Rick Andre;Morty;Gross!
5;1;Mort Dinner Rick Andre;Summer;Gross! I might never come back from the ocean.
5;1;Mort Dinner Rick Andre;Beth;Oh, you'll have to tone it down, babe. The squares can't handle it.
5;1;Mort Dinner Rick Andre;Rick;There are suicide capsules in all of your teeth. Do what you want with that. C'mon, Morty. You're on booze duty.
5;1;Mort Dinner Rick Andre;Rick;Okay, Nimbus only drinks the good shit.  So just toss this whale-ass ocean-wine in here and age it up a few centuries.
5;1;Mort Dinner Rick Andre;Morty;So time moves faster in there? I-I-Is it like a Narnia thing?
5;1;Mort Dinner Rick Andre;Rick;I'm not a beaver who believes in Jesus Christ, Morty. But yeah, it's pretty much a Narnia thing.
5;1;Mort Dinner Rick Andre;Morty;Okay, but Jessica --
5;1;Mort Dinner Rick Andre;Rick;All you have to do is bring wine, Morty. When do I ask you for anything?
5;1;Mort Dinner Rick Andre;Morty;When do you -- I haven't been to a full week of school in years! I don't know shit! And for what? How many enemies do you have to have? Why is everything a fight with you?
5;1;Mort Dinner Rick Andre;Rick;You might want to learn this early, Morty. Life is a fight.
5;1;Mort Dinner Rick Andre;Morty;With Mr. Nimbus?
5;1;Mort Dinner Rick Andre;Rick;Are you makin' fun of me? Mr. Nimbus is an ice-cold dick killer, Morty.
5;1;Mort Dinner Rick Andre;Rick;Okay, let's go. That's his magic ocean horn.
5;1;Mort Dinner Rick Andre;Jerry;Is that Mr. Nimbus?
5;1;Mort Dinner Rick Andre;Rick;Nimbus.
5;1;Mort Dinner Rick Andre;Mr. Nimbus;Richard. You look like ass.
5;1;Mort Dinner Rick Andre;Rick;Let's get this over with.
5;1;Mort Dinner Rick Andre;Jerry;I'm sorry. This is the guy?
5;1;Mort Dinner Rick Andre;Rick;Jerry...
5;1;Mort Dinner Rick Andre;Jerry;Hold on. No. I've seen you fuck a planet, and this is the guy you're afraid of?
5;1;Mort Dinner Rick Andre;Mr. Nimbus;I like this one, Rick. He is unbroken. Untamed. Perhaps he could use a firmer grip upon his leash.
5;1;Mort Dinner Rick Andre;Jerry;Okay, that's enough. I'm calling the police.
5;1;Mort Dinner Rick Andre;Mr. Nimbus;Go ahead.
5;1;Mort Dinner Rick Andre;Rick;Jerry.
5;1;Mort Dinner Rick Andre;Jerry;I will!
5;1;Mort Dinner Rick Andre;Mr. Nimbus;Good. I control them.
5;1;Mort Dinner Rick Andre;Jerry;Excuse me?
5;1;Mort Dinner Rick Andre;Rick;He controls police, Jerry.
5;1;Mort Dinner Rick Andre;Jerry;Right, that tracks. In Dumb World. Police? A strange horny ocean man is on my lawn. Well, I don't see how that's relevant, but we're white.
5;1;Mort Dinner Rick Andre;Police;Freeze! Freeze! Freeze! Freeze!
5;1;Mort Dinner Rick Andre;Mr. Nimbus;Fight.
5;1;Mort Dinner Rick Andre;Mr. Nimbus;Fuck.
5;1;Mort Dinner Rick Andre;Mr. Nimbus;Flee.
5;1;Mort Dinner Rick Andre;Police Officer;Let's get outta here.
5;1;Mort Dinner Rick Andre;Mr. Nimbus;Shall we, Richard?
5;1;Mort Dinner Rick Andre;Jerry;Okay, but how did he --
5;1;Mort Dinner Rick Andre;Rick;Jesus Christ, Jerry. He's Mr. Nimbus. He controls the police!
5;1;Mort Dinner Rick Andre;Jessica;Um, hello? Am I in the right place? I just saw a bunch of cops having sex with each other?
5;1;Mort Dinner Rick Andre;Morty;Hi! Jessica! Hi! Yeah, yup, y-you're in the right spot. Uh, everyone, th-this is Jessica. This is everybody. Uh, this is --
5;1;Mort Dinner Rick Andre;Mr. Nimbus;I am Mr. Nimbus.
5;1;Mort Dinner Rick Andre;Rick;Jesus, Nimbus, just get inside. Morty, grab the wine.
5;1;Mort Dinner Rick Andre;Morty;Yeah, in a minute. C-C'mon, Jessica.
5;1;Mort Dinner Rick Andre;Mr. Nimbus;Stand aside. Unless you are worthy of Nimbus.
5;1;Mort Dinner Rick Andre;Jerry;If that means what I think it means, I'll have you know, we watch porn together. Oh!
5;1;Mort Dinner Rick Andre;Beth;Ooh!
5;1;Mort Dinner Rick Andre;Nimbus's Starfish Assistant;Wow, okay! Looks like you guys just got the nod.
5;1;Mort Dinner Rick Andre;Beth;The nod?
5;1;Mort Dinner Rick Andre;Nimbus's Starfish Assistant;Mr. Nimbus has a sense for these things. I take it you're a sex-positive couple?
5;1;Mort Dinner Rick Andre;Jerry;Oh, yeah. Very much so.
5;1;Mort Dinner Rick Andre;Beth;We watch porn together.
5;1;Mort Dinner Rick Andre;Nimbus's Starfish Assistant;Great! I'll mark you down as eligible for a threeway. Here's all the information you'll need.
5;1;Mort Dinner Rick Andre;Beth;The king of the ocean wants to have a threesome with us?
5;1;Mort Dinner Rick Andre;Nimbus's Starfish Assistant;Totally optional. But a remarkable option to have, I assure you. Very jealous. There's a form on the last page, so we know where to send the gift basket.
5;1;Mort Dinner Rick Andre;Beth;So that just happened.
5;1;Mort Dinner Rick Andre;Jerry;You don't sound upset about it.
5;1;Mort Dinner Rick Andre;Beth;Neither do you.
5;1;Mort Dinner Rick Andre;Jerry;Oh, my God. Is this happening? To us? I thought this only happened in New York or on HBO.
5;1;Mort Dinner Rick Andre;Beth;Dr. Wong hasn't been wrong yet.
5;1;Mort Dinner Rick Andre;Jerry;You're right. This is exactly what she was talking about.
5;1;Mort Dinner Rick Andre;Morty;So, uh, yeah. J-Just make yourself comfortable. Y'know, ch-choose a movie or -- or we can watch some interdimensional cable if you want.
5;1;Mort Dinner Rick Andre;TV Voice;"We now return to Nintendo 69""."""
5;1;Mort Dinner Rick Andre;TV Voice;Nintendo, oh, what are you doing to me? Oh, Nintendo, oh, Nin--
5;1;Mort Dinner Rick Andre;Morty;Or we can watch whatever, y'know. Wh-Whatever you're into.
5;1;Mort Dinner Rick Andre;Jessica;Morty, did I hear you're getting wine?
5;1;Mort Dinner Rick Andre;Morty;Yeah, I gotta get some wine for Mr. Nimbus.
5;1;Mort Dinner Rick Andre;Jessica;Got any extra?
5;1;Mort Dinner Rick Andre;Morty;Oh. Uh, yeah. Yeah, yeah, I'll go get some, just for you.
5;1;Mort Dinner Rick Andre;Jessica;Cool. Hurry back.
5;1;Mort Dinner Rick Andre;Hoovy;Looks like you could use a hand.
5;1;Mort Dinner Rick Andre;Morty;Oh, hey! Yeah, th-th-that'd be great.
5;1;Mort Dinner Rick Andre;Hoovy;No problem.
5;1;Mort Dinner Rick Andre;Bova;Hoovy? Dinner's ready!
5;1;Mort Dinner Rick Andre;Hoovy;Be right there, sugar hoof! Just helping this young man through a portal with that crate full of alcohol that's been here for decades.
5;1;Mort Dinner Rick Andre;Morty;Hey, thanks, Hoovy. I-I really appreciate that. I-I got a girl over, and I really, really like her. I-I'm just nervous.
5;1;Mort Dinner Rick Andre;Hoovy;Oh, I know that feeling. When I first started seeing Bova, I could only think about all the ways I was gonna mess it up. 
5;1;Mort Dinner Rick Andre;Morty;So what'd you do?
5;1;Mort Dinner Rick Andre;Hoovy;Oh, I messed it up. But I found the one who loves me for that.
5;1;Mort Dinner Rick Andre;Morty;Thanks. I-I really needed to hear that. Here, t-take one of these.
5;1;Mort Dinner Rick Andre;Hoovy;Oh, you don't have to.
5;1;Mort Dinner Rick Andre;Morty;No, I-I want to. You have a good day, Hoovy.
5;1;Mort Dinner Rick Andre;Hoovy;You have a great time with that lady up there. Just relax.
5;1;Mort Dinner Rick Andre;Morty;Will do!
5;1;Mort Dinner Rick Andre;Hoovy;Bova?
5;1;Mort Dinner Rick Andre;Japheth;Why did you leave us, Father?
5;1;Mort Dinner Rick Andre;Hoovy;Japheth? When were you born?
5;1;Mort Dinner Rick Andre;Japheth;I swore to Mother if I ever met you, I'd avenge her.
5;1;Mort Dinner Rick Andre;Hoovy;It wasn't my fault.
5;1;Mort Dinner Rick Andre;Japheth;Whose, then? Whose?!
5;1;Mort Dinner Rick Andre;Hoovy;The boy from the magic door.
5;1;Mort Dinner Rick Andre;Mr. Nimbus;Shall we discuss terms?
5;1;Mort Dinner Rick Andre;Rick;Yeah, fine. Whatever. Terms.
5;1;Mort Dinner Rick Andre;Mr. Nimbus;Term number one -- I am King of the Ocean.
5;1;Mort Dinner Rick Andre;Rick;The place I shit? Go ahead.
5;1;Mort Dinner Rick Andre;Mr. Nimbus;Term number two -- Stop shitting in the ocean.
5;1;Mort Dinner Rick Andre;Rick;No idea what you're talking about.
5;1;Mort Dinner Rick Andre;Mr. Nimbus;Delicious. Another.
5;1;Mort Dinner Rick Andre;Morty;Oh, uh, well, I-I was thinking of using this one for --
5;1;Mort Dinner Rick Andre;Rick;Morty, just give him the bottle. God damn.
5;1;Mort Dinner Rick Andre;Mr. Nimbus;Another!
5;1;Mort Dinner Rick Andre;Jessica;Morty, you get the wine?
5;1;Mort Dinner Rick Andre;Morty;Hey, Jessica. Um, yeah, sorry. I just -- just going back to get it.
5;1;Mort Dinner Rick Andre;Jessica;Oh. I thought you already went.
5;1;Mort Dinner Rick Andre;Morty;I did! I just -- just got a little busy. Going right now, again! You go ahead and fire up that movie!
5;1;Mort Dinner Rick Andre;Jessica;That's okay. I'll wait for you.
5;1;Mort Dinner Rick Andre;Morty;Holy shit, holy shit, holy shit, holy shit!
5;1;Mort Dinner Rick Andre;Japheth;I've been waiting for you.
5;1;Mort Dinner Rick Andre;Morty;Oh, wow. Hoovy, right?
5;1;Mort Dinner Rick Andre;Japheth;Never say his name!
5;1;Mort Dinner Rick Andre;Morty;Jesus Christ! Why -- Why is every old guy super jacked? Sorry! I'm sorry! I-I just need the wine! I'm sorry! Stop it!
5;1;Mort Dinner Rick Andre;Japheth;Fucking kill you!
5;1;Mort Dinner Rick Andre;Morty;Ow! Okay, screw this! You know what?
5;1;Mort Dinner Rick Andre;Japheth;You!
5;1;Mort Dinner Rick Andre;Morty;Yeah, fuck you, Hoovy!
5;1;Mort Dinner Rick Andre;Japheth's Son;Father?
5;1;Mort Dinner Rick Andre;Japheth;It's him! I told you he'd come back!
5;1;Mort Dinner Rick Andre;Japheth's Son;Holy shit! 
5;1;Mort Dinner Rick Andre;Morty;Okay, look, he wasn't old like 10 seconds ago. Ow! Motherfucker!
5;1;Mort Dinner Rick Andre;Japheth's Son;I'm sorry, Father. I'm sorry we never believed.
5;1;Mort Dinner Rick Andre;Japheth;He'll come back. Stop him. Stop him.
5;1;Mort Dinner Rick Andre;Japheth's Son Son;Papa, why do we guard the gate?
5;1;Mort Dinner Rick Andre;Japheth's Son;Because one day, the dark child shall return. And we will be ready.
5;1;Mort Dinner Rick Andre;Mr. Nimbus;Delicious. Where is your wine boy, Richard? I thirst.
5;1;Mort Dinner Rick Andre;Rick;He's getting it. Stop eating beignets like that.
5;1;Mort Dinner Rick Andre;Beth;Participant voids all liability in the event of death by orgasm?
5;1;Mort Dinner Rick Andre;Jerry;Are we really ready to open things this wide? What if it gets weird? What if I fall in love with him?
5;1;Mort Dinner Rick Andre;Morty;No, no, no, no, no. Damn it!
5;1;Mort Dinner Rick Andre;Mr. Nimbus;What was that? Another scheme of yours, Richard? I know you're planning something.
5;1;Mort Dinner Rick Andre;Rick;It's nothing. Will you excuse me, please?
5;1;Mort Dinner Rick Andre;Rick;What the fuck is going on? Where's the wine?
5;1;Mort Dinner Rick Andre;Morty;Dad was horny and I dropped it.
5;1;Mort Dinner Rick Andre;Rick;God, I can't -- I can't believe you're fucking this up.
5;1;Mort Dinner Rick Andre;Morty;I'm not fucking it up! There was a guy in the thing and --
5;1;Mort Dinner Rick Andre;Rick;There's always a guy in a thing!
5;1;Mort Dinner Rick Andre;Mr. Nimbus;Land dwellers do not keep Nimbus waiting and live.
5;1;Mort Dinner Rick Andre;Rick;"Be right out! Goddammit. Do you see this whisper kitchen Frasier"" bullshit you're making me do? Morty, just get the wine. Beth and Jerry, stop trying to fuck Nimbus."""
5;1;Mort Dinner Rick Andre;Beth;Well, we wouldn't do it here.
5;1;Mort Dinner Rick Andre;Jerry;I'll have you know he propositioned us.
5;1;Mort Dinner Rick Andre;Rick;He propositions everybody!
5;1;Mort Dinner Rick Andre;Morty;Hey, hey, hey, Jessica. W-What's up?
5;1;Mort Dinner Rick Andre;Jessica;Seems like you're busy.
5;1;Mort Dinner Rick Andre;Morty;No, no, no! I ran into a little trouble. But -- But -- But I'll go get that wine right now.
5;1;Mort Dinner Rick Andre;Jessica;But you said were going to get it like twice already.
5;1;Mort Dinner Rick Andre;Morty;I-I-I was and I-I'm getting it right now.
5;1;Mort Dinner Rick Andre;Narnian Soldier;Holy shit, it's him!
5;1;Mort Dinner Rick Andre;Morty;God damn it! What do you want me to say?! I-I'm sorry!
5;1;Mort Dinner Rick Andre;Narnian King;We finally beat him. But let's always remain vigilant because you never know. He might be back one day.
5;1;Mort Dinner Rick Andre;Morty;Okay, Narnia! Let's go. Let's fucking go!
5;1;Mort Dinner Rick Andre;Narnian King's Son;It is over. The boy is not coming back.
5;1;Mort Dinner Rick Andre;Narnian King;He always comes back.
5;1;Mort Dinner Rick Andre;Narnian King's Son;You have wasted our lives, our very futures, on a fantasy! A lie!
5;1;Mort Dinner Rick Andre;Narnian King;I know what I saw.
5;1;Mort Dinner Rick Andre;Narnian King's Son;You saw nothing!
5;1;Mort Dinner Rick Andre;Narnian King;You are a foolish boy!
5;1;Mort Dinner Rick Andre;Narnian Wizard;Those called fools are the only ones brave enough to see the truth.
5;1;Mort Dinner Rick Andre;Narnian King's Son;Tell me, Father. Am I a fool now?
5;1;Mort Dinner Rick Andre;Narnian Wizard;I was born in the pits that made these stones. I lost my years building a temple to a lie. So I made lies my power. And what is power but a lie we --
5;1;Mort Dinner Rick Andre;Narnian Wizard;Oh shit, he's real! He's real! I was wrong! I was so wrong! God is real!
5;1;Mort Dinner Rick Andre;Rick;Wow. Impeccable service. Big tip.
5;1;Mort Dinner Rick Andre;Mr. Nimbus;I liked your other one more. What was his name? Kyle?
5;1;Mort Dinner Rick Andre;Morty;What?
5;1;Mort Dinner Rick Andre;Rick;Nothing. Can we just sign this thing and go?
5;1;Mort Dinner Rick Andre;Morty;Jessica, I-I'm so sorry. 
5;1;Mort Dinner Rick Andre;Jessica;I mean, it's fine. You were only gone like a couple minutes. Morty, are you okay?
5;1;Mort Dinner Rick Andre;Morty;I'm -- I'm sorry, Jessica. We just never seem to get it right, do we?
5;1;Mort Dinner Rick Andre;Jessica;No, I guess we don't. But I'm glad you called me. Maybe we can start over, get it right this time.
5;1;Mort Dinner Rick Andre;Morty;Yeah. I'd -- I'd like that.
5;1;Mort Dinner Rick Andre;Jessica;Thanks for bringing the wine.
5;1;Mort Dinner Rick Andre;Morty;Totally worth it.
5;1;Mort Dinner Rick Andre;Jessica;Do we need an opener?
5;1;Mort Dinner Rick Andre;Morty;Oh. I'll -- I'll -- I'll go get it.
5;1;Mort Dinner Rick Andre;Mr. Nimbus;Mmm. I do so love to sign upon the dotted line. Shall we?
5;1;Mort Dinner Rick Andre;Rick;Jesus Christ, yes.
5;1;Mort Dinner Rick Andre;Mr. Nimbus;And who is your witness? My witness is the squid.
5;1;Mort Dinner Rick Andre;Rick;Really proud of this SeaWorld theme, aren't you?
5;1;Mort Dinner Rick Andre;Mr. Nimbus;Hey, just get a witness, man. Don't make this about me. Or perhaps Richard has no one with whom he can trust his life. Who truly knows him. Save me.
5;1;Mort Dinner Rick Andre;Rick;Fine! I'll get someone. Oh, my God. Morty! C'mere. I need you for some bullshit.
5;1;Mort Dinner Rick Andre;Morty;Look, Rick, I've done everything you've asked. Now can I just have some time with my girlfriend?
5;1;Mort Dinner Rick Andre;Rick;Your girlfriend?
5;1;Mort Dinner Rick Andre;Morty;I mean, she's not -- we kissed, but I'm just trying to take it slow. You gotta give these things time to breathe, y'know?
5;1;Mort Dinner Rick Andre;Narnian Female;Do you know why you're special, Adam?
5;1;Mort Dinner Rick Andre;Adam;Because I am The Traveler?
5;1;Mort Dinner Rick Andre;Narnian Female;Yes. You will be the one to pass through the door. You will be the one to end our pain.
5;1;Mort Dinner Rick Andre;Adam;But, Mother, what about my pain?
5;1;Mort Dinner Rick Andre;Narnian Female;Your pain shall set us free. It is time to begin.
5;1;Mort Dinner Rick Andre;Narnian Female;Again. Again!
5;1;Mort Dinner Rick Andre;Narnian Female;You are not ready.
5;1;Mort Dinner Rick Andre;Adam;Please, Mother --
5;1;Mort Dinner Rick Andre;Narnian Female;Do you think he will show you mercy? Like he did to us? Again!
5;1;Mort Dinner Rick Andre;Beth;Does anyone need anything?
5;1;Mort Dinner Rick Andre;Jerry;Does Nimbus need anything?
5;1;Mort Dinner Rick Andre;Morty;Holy shit! 
5;1;Mort Dinner Rick Andre;Jerry;Don't judge. We're growing as a couple!
5;1;Mort Dinner Rick Andre;Morty;Aah! Why is this happening to me?!
5;1;Mort Dinner Rick Andre;Adam;For the future!
5;1;Mort Dinner Rick Andre;Mr. Nimbus;You dare assassinate Nimbus?
5;1;Mort Dinner Rick Andre;Adam;Sorry. Wait. Who -- Who is that?
5;1;Mort Dinner Rick Andre;Jerry;Get in line, pal!
5;1;Mort Dinner Rick Andre;Spirit;Such a waste.
5;1;Mort Dinner Rick Andre;Adam;M-Mother?
5;1;Mort Dinner Rick Andre;Morty;Jessica!
5;1;Mort Dinner Rick Andre;Rick;You just had to touch the ocean.
5;1;Mort Dinner Rick Andre;Morty;Aaah! Shut up! There isn't time to -- It's all fucked! And you fucked it!
5;1;Mort Dinner Rick Andre;Morty;Huh?
5;1;Mort Dinner Rick Andre;Old Morty;You're early.
5;1;Mort Dinner Rick Andre;Morty;W-What is this place?
5;1;Mort Dinner Rick Andre;Old Morty;The end. But also a beginning. Isn't every end a beginning?
5;1;Mort Dinner Rick Andre;Morty;Stay back! I don't want your stripped down Sundance sci-fi bullshit. Where's Jessica?
5;1;Mort Dinner Rick Andre;Old Morty;Jessica. That was her name, wasn't it? Thank you, Morty. I had forgotten. 
5;1;Mort Dinner Rick Andre;Old Morty;Oh, right. You'll be needing this. For the wine.
5;1;Mort Dinner Rick Andre;Narnian Cyborg;Oh, shit, we got him!
5;1;Mort Dinner Rick Andre;Narnian Cyborg;Can you believe he bought that fucking tree bullshit? We fucking got him!
5;1;Mort Dinner Rick Andre;Mr. Nimbus;Very well. If you seek war with Atlantis, you shall have it.
5;1;Mort Dinner Rick Andre;Rick;Oh, I've already been to war with Atlantis when I D-Day'd that Mermaid Puss!
5;1;Mort Dinner Rick Andre;Mr. Nimbus;I knew that was you! Prepare my exit parade! Say goodbye to your precious dry land! For soon it will be wet! Wet!
5;1;Mort Dinner Rick Andre;Rick;Yeah, global warming is already doing that, asshole. But sure, yeah, go for it. Make us slightly more wet!
5;1;Mort Dinner Rick Andre;Mr. Nimbus;Am I a joke to you?
5;1;Mort Dinner Rick Andre;Rick;Yes, you are a fucking joke! You fucking suck! You've always sucked! Y-Y-Y know why we haven't fought in years? 'Cause you're an embarrassment to me and I don't need you anymore. I don't need anybody. All I do is eat ass and 69 Nintendos, bro. Every day.
5;1;Mort Dinner Rick Andre;Mr. Nimbus;Or maybe you hate me, because I am the only man to see how far you have fallen. I used to fear you. Respect you. Now all that's left is pity -- for a sad, drunk shell of a man too afraid to see how alone he truly is. If Diane were alive today, what would she think --
5;1;Mort Dinner Rick Andre;Rick;Don't  establish canonical backstory with me, you Red Lob--
5;1;Mort Dinner Rick Andre;Narnian Cyborg;Oh, good. You're awake.
5;1;Mort Dinner Rick Andre;Morty;I just took some wine! I said I was sorry. What the fuck is wrong with you people?!
5;1;Mort Dinner Rick Andre;Narnian Cyborg;I have been asking that for centuries. I was created to study you, Morty, to know you. But the closer I looked, the more I do not recognize myself.
5;1;Mort Dinner Rick Andre;Morty;Uh, yeah, man, I really don't have time for --
5;1;Mort Dinner Rick Andre;Narnian Cyborg;I have often wondered who would we be without you, Morty? Are we anything beyond our hatred? And when she came, I thought she would be the answer. Frozen in time. Forever asleep.
5;1;Mort Dinner Rick Andre;Narnian Cyborg;We could not understand her purpose, so we hid her away. Why do we always hide the truths we fear?
5;1;Mort Dinner Rick Andre;Morty;I don't give a shit, nerd! Let her go!
5;1;Mort Dinner Rick Andre;Narnian Cyborg;Why -- Why did I clone myself genitals?
5;1;Mort Dinner Rick Andre;Morty;Ow! I don't care, bitch! Do it!
5;1;Mort Dinner Rick Andre;Narnian Cyborg;Ooh! Asshole!
5;1;Mort Dinner Rick Andre;Morty;Yeah, guess I am an asshole! Y'know, sometimes you gotta be an asshole! My grandpa taught me that!
5;1;Mort Dinner Rick Andre;Narnian Cyborg;Okay, okay, okay, fine!
5;1;Mort Dinner Rick Andre;Jessica;Morty?
5;1;Mort Dinner Rick Andre;Morty;Hey, Jessica. Wow. Must've been some nap, huh? I-Is that ooze or -- I'm not sure what to call it. It l-l-looks like ooze. Okay. W-We can catch up later.
5;1;Mort Dinner Rick Andre;Morty;What the -- Rick! Rick!
5;1;Mort Dinner Rick Andre;Rick;...obster motherfucker.
5;1;Mort Dinner Rick Andre;Morty;Rick!
5;1;Mort Dinner Rick Andre;Rick;Screw this. What am I even doing?
5;1;Mort Dinner Rick Andre;Morty;Help!
5;1;Mort Dinner Rick Andre;Mr. Nimbus;Where are you? Come back here. I'm going to make the land wet!
5;1;Mort Dinner Rick Andre;Rick;Y'know what, I'd love to see it. Do it! God, do anything! Just don't use me as an excuse anymore!
5;1;Mort Dinner Rick Andre;Morty;Rick!
5;1;Mort Dinner Rick Andre;Jerry;Wow. That was intense. You look stressed.
5;1;Mort Dinner Rick Andre;Beth;We signed the paperwork.
5;1;Mort Dinner Rick Andre;Mr. Nimbus;I must go.
5;1;Mort Dinner Rick Andre;Beth;Well, your people have our number!
5;1;Mort Dinner Rick Andre;Jerry;Your starfish mentioned some kind of basket?
5;1;Mort Dinner Rick Andre;Rick;Jesus, Morty.
5;1;Mort Dinner Rick Andre;Morty;Stop! No, no! Not today!
5;1;Mort Dinner Rick Andre;Rick;Can't you go one day without -- You don't get to -- What the --
5;1;Mort Dinner Rick Andre;Morty;I fucked it up, okay?
5;1;Mort Dinner Rick Andre;Rick;It's okay, Morty. That's what you do. Now lemme Deus Ex Machina this shit and let's go home.
5;1;Mort Dinner Rick Andre;Rick;God, why does everyone go Cyber-Punk Bird? So fuckin' hack.
5;1;Mort Dinner Rick Andre;Rick;Oh, shit. Well, that's cool. 
5;1;Mort Dinner Rick Andre;Rick;Okay, we might be a little fucked.
5;1;Mort Dinner Rick Andre;Mr. Nimbus;Did you think I would let you die alone, Richard? I am Mr. Nimbus!
5;1;Mort Dinner Rick Andre;Morty;Wow. Phew. You -- You still got time for that movie?
5;1;Mort Dinner Rick Andre;Jessica;Yes. Time. I had nothing but time. Endless time. At first, it was madness. Then enlightenment. Then madness again. But perhaps it was a gift. I could see the life of time.
5;1;Mort Dinner Rick Andre;Jessica;And as I watched the life of time in all its fleeting, terrible light, I wondered, had I lived? Was I just the object in another's story? Was that all I ever was? Could I be more? I had nothing but time and still no answer. Time without purpose is a prison.
5;1;Mort Dinner Rick Andre;Jessica;I have glimpsed into the mind of eternity. Perhaps the mind of God. And found nothing but silence. I think we should just be friends.
5;1;Mort Dinner Rick Andre;Morty;Oh, yeah. I-I-I get that. Guess we missed our moment.
5;1;Mort Dinner Rick Andre;Jessica;Yes. But there will be more. For both of us. Goodbye, Morty.
5;1;Mort Dinner Rick Andre;Car Driver;Hey, how's it going?
5;1;Mort Dinner Rick Andre;Jessica;Fuck off! I'm a Time-god!
5;1;Mort Dinner Rick Andre;Mr. Nimbus;Fighting by your side again, Richard. It was, uh --
5;1;Mort Dinner Rick Andre;Rick;Yeah.
5;1;Mort Dinner Rick Andre;Mr. Nimbus;Then there is no treaty. Because there is no war.
5;1;Mort Dinner Rick Andre;Rick;Aw, Nimbus. That's -- That's really chill of you, man.
5;1;Mort Dinner Rick Andre;Mr. Nimbus;Richard. Before you were my greatest enemy, you were my only friend.
5;1;Mort Dinner Rick Andre;Summer;Grandpa, I got the shell!
5;1;Mort Dinner Rick Andre;Rick;Shit! Okay, Nimbus, look.
5;1;Mort Dinner Rick Andre;Mr. Nimbus;You son of a bitch! Betrayal!
5;1;Mort Dinner Rick Andre;Rick;My weapons, Morty!
5;1;Mort Dinner Rick Andre;Morty;I-I-I used them all!
5;1;Mort Dinner Rick Andre;Summer;Grandpa! Wait, Grandpa, what do I do? I have the shell. Should I blow it? Is that -- I'm -- I'm just gonna blow it!
5;1;Mort Dinner Rick Andre;Rick;Don't blow it! Destroy the horn!
5;1;Mort Dinner Rick Andre;Morty;What the hell, Summer?!
5;1;Mort Dinner Rick Andre;Rick;You were supposed to destroy the horn!
5;1;Mort Dinner Rick Andre;Summer;How was I supposed to know that?
5;1;Mort Dinner Rick Andre;Mr. Nimbus;Police! Take this piece of shit to jail.
5;1;Mort Dinner Rick Andre;Rick;I told, ugh, I told you. He's an ice-cold dick killer! Nimbus!
5;1;Mort Dinner Rick Andre;Summer;Wait. So how can he --
5;1;Mort Dinner Rick Andre;Jerry;Jesus, Summer. He's Mr. Nimbus. He controls the police!
5;1;Mort Dinner Rick Andre;Beth;Jer, I think more than one safe word sort of defeats the point.
5;1;Mort Dinner Rick Andre;Jerry;I know, I just wanna make sure we have every opportunity to stop. Super excited about it though.
5;1;Mort Dinner Rick Andre;Beth;Me too, so excited. Jerry, are we doing this because we both want this? Or because it's what we think the other one wants?
5;1;Mort Dinner Rick Andre;Jerry;I just wanted to prove that I love you so much I would do this for you!
5;1;Mort Dinner Rick Andre;Beth;Same! Let's take that prize and get out before we make a huge mistake.
5;1;Mort Dinner Rick Andre;Mr. Nimbus;Getting cold feet?
5;1;Mort Dinner Rick Andre;Jerry;No. Please don't tell Rick.
5;1;Mort Dinner Rick Andre;Beth;He wouldn't understand.
5;1;Mort Dinner Rick Andre;Mr. Nimbus;Yes, he would.
5;2;Mortyplicity;Beth;You two are hungry.
5;2;Mortyplicity;Rick;It's a big day.
5;2;Mortyplicity;Morty;We're gonna kill god.
5;2;Mortyplicity;Jerry;Come again?
5;2;Mortyplicity;Rick;Christian god is real. He's been asleep for thousands of years. We're gonna sneak up there and kill 'em.
5;2;Mortyplicity;Morty;Mob style.
5;2;Mortyplicity;Rick;Just whack his ass.
5;2;Mortyplicity;Summer;Can I kill god?
5;2;Mortyplicity;Rick;Fuck off, summer.
5;2;Mortyplicity;Morty;As if.
5;2;Mortyplicity;Jerry;Beth, do you hear this?
5;2;Mortyplicity;Beth;Sweetie, don't get all worked up before your job interview.
5;2;Mortyplicity;Rick;Job interview?
5;2;Mortyplicity;Jerry;Yes. Is that so hard to believe?
5;2;Mortyplicity;Rick;Actually, yeah. Something's off.
5;2;Mortyplicity;Beth;No!
5;2;Mortyplicity;Morty;Shit!
5;2;Mortyplicity;Mr. Always Wants To Be Hunted;Hunt me! Hunt me! Hunt me! Somebody hunt me!
5;2;Mortyplicity;Rick;Don't hunt him to completion!
5;2;Mortyplicity;Mr. Always Wants To Be Hunted;Hunt me!
5;2;Mortyplicity;Rick;Oh, shit. Um... Everyone start packing. N-no time to explain.
5;2;Mortyplicity;Jerry;Rick?
5;2;Mortyplicity;Beth;Dad, what's wrong?
5;2;Mortyplicity;Rick;Someone just killed a decoy family.
5;2;Mortyplicity;Mr. Always Wants To Be Hunted;I'm Mr. Always Wants To Be Hunted!
5;2;Mortyplicity;Rick;Yes, and how interesting did you think that would stay?!
5;2;Mortyplicity;Morty;You made clones of us?
5;2;Mortyplicity;Rick;Decoys, morty. Very different. Very different, sweetie.
5;2;Mortyplicity;Morty;Different h-h-- ow!
5;2;Mortyplicity;Beth;Yeah, dad. Different h-how?
5;2;Mortyplicity;Rick;Lotta people out there want a piece of this, sweetie. I'm cool, and it makes them feel bad. So, y'know, after that trouble with Space Beth, I made passable copies of the family and placed them around the country as a buffer zone to protect --
5;2;Mortyplicity;Jerry;But why does he always want to be hunted?
5;2;Mortyplicity;Beth;Jerry...
5;2;Mortyplicity;Morty;That's not important right now, dad.
5;2;Mortyplicity;Jerry;Sure, guys. Rick can make secret decoys of the family and place them all around the country, but fuck me if I have questions about the starfish man in a target suit.
5;2;Mortyplicity;Summer;So thankful this is my Saturday.
5;2;Mortyplicity;Jerry;Why was he in that cryo-pod?!
5;2;Mortyplicity;Rick;The cryo-pod is what confuses you? Jerry, can't you see we've moved on to higher stakes?
5;2;Mortyplicity;Jerry;Well, I don't see any stakes at all.
5;2;Mortyplicity;Rick;Ah, shit!
5;2;Mortyplicity;Jerry;"Guess we'll just be saying ciao bella"" to our deposit, then --"""
5;2;Mortyplicity;Rick;Shut up and pack, Jerry. Squids just killed a decoy family.
5;2;Mortyplicity;Beth;Decoy family?
5;2;Mortyplicity;Morty;Is this is why you wanted to get out of town?
5;2;Mortyplicity;Rick;You think I'd lie to you about why we're on vacation, Morty? I wouldn't lie to you. Well, that's a lie. Huh...
5;2;Mortyplicity;Summer;So, someone out there is trying to kill us?
5;2;Mortyplicity;Rick;Someone's always trying to kill us -- That's what the decoys are for. They go on fun, self-contained terrestrial adventures and... Take bullets meant for us. Shit.
5;2;Mortyplicity;Jerry;Ahhh, no!
5;2;Mortyplicity;Rick;Oh, shit. Decoy family.
5;2;Mortyplicity;Morty;I think dad was still outside. Wh-wh-what's a decoy family?
5;2;Mortyplicity;Rick;Hard concept, morty. Hard concept. I've never really cracked it, if I'm being honest. Decided it was maybe better as a kind of kinetic mislead for another special episode!
5;2;Mortyplicity;Morty;Oh, cool.
5;2;Mortyplicity;Announcer;"We now return to When Wolf."""""
5;2;Mortyplicity;Rick;Whoa. A time-traveling wolf? Count me in.
5;2;Mortyplicity;Morty;"Yeah, I never thought of the where"" in werewolf. Like who, what, when and where. C-clever wordplay!"""
5;2;Mortyplicity;Dracula;When Wolf.
5;2;Mortyplicity;When Wolf;Dracula.
5;2;Mortyplicity;Dracula;You know why I'm here. I'm safe here, Ian. Christianity hasn't been invented yet -- Crosses are just baby t's to me now. I got out. Please, don't invite me back in.
5;2;Mortyplicity;Morty;Huh, kinda mucked it up with this Dracula stuff. 
5;2;Mortyplicity;Rick;You're right. It shows a lack of faith in their core concept. I'd much rather watch When Wolf to the '20s and invest in the stock market... But then eat people.
5;2;Mortyplicity;Morty;Yeah.
5;2;Mortyplicity;Rick;Look, if you really want to know what happened to Beth's mom, it -- whup. Squid aliens just killed a decoy family.
5;2;Mortyplicity;Beth;Decoy family? You made more clones?
5;2;Mortyplicity;Rick;Clones are like 32% of all Sci-Fi, sweetie. You don't get to own 'clones. Yes, I made some decoys. They're exactly like us, with a few tweaks and a backdoor shutdown.
5;2;Mortyplicity;Beth;Do you just get hard creating sentient life?
5;2;Mortyplicity;Rick;Actually, I get hard protecting my family.
5;2;Mortyplicity;Morty;Ew. Gross.
5;2;Mortyplicity;Beth;Yeah, now everyone gets killer doppelgangers. Cool deal.
5;2;Mortyplicity;Rick;The decoys are harmless, Beth.
5;2;Mortyplicity;Summer;Grandpa Rick, do the decoys know they're decoys?
5;2;Mortyplicity;Rick;They wouldn't be very good decoys if they did, sum sum.
5;2;Mortyplicity;Summer;So they think they're us?
5;2;Mortyplicity;Rick;That's the deal.
5;2;Mortyplicity;Summer;How do you know we're not decoys? Oh, my god. We're decoys.
5;2;Mortyplicity;Rick;Oh, god. We might not be real. W-we might be decoys! M-morty, quick!
5;2;Mortyplicity;Morty;Wh-wh-what do I do?
5;2;Mortyplicity;Rick;My failsafe, morty. M-m-my final, secret failsafe. I-it proves I'm real. You have to help me. I-I-I'd never joke about this. There's a barcode, morty. A-a barcode on the interior of my left ass cheek.
5;2;Mortyplicity;Morty;What?
5;2;Mortyplicity;Rick;Morty, please, I'm begging you.
5;2;Mortyplicity;Morty;I'm not looking at your ass.
5;2;Mortyplicity;Rick;Please, morty! Is it there? God damn it! Just tell me if I'm real!
5;2;Mortyplicity;Summer;Morty, do it!
5;2;Mortyplicity;Morty;Gross!
5;2;Mortyplicity;Beth;Dad!
5;2;Mortyplicity;Rick;Summer, you fucking idiot. We're not decoys.
5;2;Mortyplicity;Morty;Wh-why did I get punished?!
5;2;Mortyplicity;Rick;A, decoys don't build decoys, and, b, you think the mere suggestion I'm fake would break me? Christ, I'm not your mom.
5;2;Mortyplicity;Beth;Fuck off.
5;2;Mortyplicity;Rick;Geez, these guys really wanna kill me bad. Alright. Here's the plan. We're gonna hide out with a decoy family, and when these squids show up, we jump their asses.
5;2;Mortyplicity;Rick;Jerry! Come on! Family emergency.
5;2;Mortyplicity;Jerry;A bigger emergency than my lemon squares not setting? They're gluten free, sugar free, and lemon free.
5;2;Mortyplicity;Decoy Rick;Think you got the wrong house, bro.
5;2;Mortyplicity;Rick;Analysis mode. Password 8-0-0-8-5.
5;2;Mortyplicity;Beth;Kind of expected a funnier password. 
5;2;Mortyplicity;Rick;I didn't plan on showing them off.
5;2;Mortyplicity;Morty;"Damn. Like Westworld."""""
5;2;Mortyplicity;Rick;"Yes, Morty, like Westworld."" But don't fuck them. S-summer!"""
5;2;Mortyplicity;Summer;Whatever, creep. I'm gonna see how accurate you got my room.
5;2;Mortyplicity;Morty;Rick, when you say you made an exact replica of the house, d-did you mean like, y'know, a-a-an exact replica?
5;2;Mortyplicity;Rick;I know about the yosemite t-shirt, Morty.
5;2;Mortyplicity;Morty;Shit.
5;2;Mortyplicity;Rick;You know you can use tissues, right?
5;2;Mortyplicity;Morty;I can't finish without it.
5;2;Mortyplicity;Beth;So you do know what a happy family looks like.
5;2;Mortyplicity;Rick;I know what a fake one looks like.
5;2;Mortyplicity;Morty;Uh, Rick?
5;2;Mortyplicity;Rick;What?
5;2;Mortyplicity;Morty;Did you use this house to make decoys, too?
5;2;Mortyplicity;Rick;What? Morty, why the fuck would I do that? You think I'd go somewhere else to -- Okay. Well, I am now less worried about the squids.
5;2;Mortyplicity;Rick;Isolate head at normal processing.
5;2;Mortyplicity;Rick;What the fuck you think you're doing down there? You're making decoys?
5;2;Mortyplicity;Decoy Rick;Wait, how do you -- Oh, god. Summer was right.
5;2;Mortyplicity;Rick;Everyone in the car.
5;2;Mortyplicity;Beth;You said decoys didn't make decoys.
5;2;Mortyplicity;Rick;And, usually, they don't. But again, it's nothing to worry about, because decoys are harmless. Just have to, y'know, visit the rest and terminate the program.
5;2;Mortyplicity;Beth;Terminate? They're alive, dad.
5;2;Mortyplicity;Rick;And at some point, they won't be. That's how existing works. W-w-what, are you gonna save every stray cat?
5;2;Mortyplicity;Beth;No, but I can resist making more of them in a lab.
5;2;Mortyplicity;Rick;"Gah, look! Save the empathy. It's more termite infestation than ""Blade Runner"" --"
5;2;Mortyplicity;Summer;I still think we're decoys.
5;2;Mortyplicity;Morty;You just want an excuse to stop trying.
5;2;Mortyplicity;Summer;Yeah. And?
5;2;Mortyplicity;Jerry;Oooh. There's a handsome fellow.
5;2;Mortyplicity;Rick;Uh-oh.
5;2;Mortyplicity;Beth;I thought you made them harmless.
5;2;Mortyplicity;Rick;I don't remember making this one.
5;2;Mortyplicity;Decoy Jerry;Oh, hi, Rick. Family, me? Hey, when did you all leave?
5;2;Mortyplicity;Rick;Analysis mode, 8-0-0-8-5.
5;2;Mortyplicity;Decoy Jerry;Hmm?
5;2;Mortyplicity;Rick;N-nothing, buddy. You-you gotta stop with all that coffee. It's making you loopy. H-happy analysis mode.
5;2;Mortyplicity;Decoy Jerry;Happy analysis mode to you, too!
5;2;Mortyplicity;Decoy Rick;Think you got the wrong house, bro.
5;2;Mortyplicity;Rick;Analysis mode. Password 8-0-0...
5;2;Mortyplicity;Decoy Rick;Shit! You think I'm a decoy?
5;2;Mortyplicity;Rick;How do you know about the decoys!
5;2;Mortyplicity;Decoy Rick;They were my idea!
5;2;Mortyplicity;Decoy Jerry;Well, now I know you're pranking me.

5;2;Mortyplicity;Decoy Rick #2;"Yes, morty, like Ex Machina."" But don't fuck them. Summer!"""
5;2;Mortyplicity;Decoy Summer #2;Whatever, weirdo. I'm gonna see how wrong you got my room.
5;2;Mortyplicity;Decoy Beth #2;So you do know what a loving family looks like.
5;2;Mortyplicity;Decoy Rick #2;A simulated one, yes.
5;2;Mortyplicity;Beth;Why are we hiding? 
5;2;Mortyplicity;Rick;He thinks he's me, and I was about to start terminating decoys.
5;2;Mortyplicity;Beth;But we're not decoys.
5;2;Mortyplicity;Rick;Sure, tell him that.
5;2;Mortyplicity;Decoy Morty #2;Rick? Did you make decoys here, too?
5;2;Mortyplicity;Decoy Rick #2;Morty, what reason could I have for -- What the... Isolate head at normal processing! You dumb asshole, you made decoys?
5;2;Mortyplicity;Decoy Rick;Again, they were my idea. Wait, w-what happened to the other guy?
5;2;Mortyplicity;Decoy Rick #2;Other guy?
5;2;Mortyplicity;Decoy Rick;Wait, that means I'm a decoy. Fucking Summer.
5;2;Mortyplicity;Decoy Rick #2;Check the closets.
5;2;Mortyplicity;Decoy Rick #2;They've gone rogue! Killer decoys! Take out the decoys!
5;2;Mortyplicity;Decoy Rick;Shit! Somebody put a gun in my teeth!
5;2;Mortyplicity;Beth;Stop shooting, dad. They're us, we don't have to fight them!
5;2;Mortyplicity;Rick;Classic prisoners dilemma, Beth. I-I'm a cool guy, I -- y'know? I can talk it out. But that asshole...
5;2;Mortyplicity;Decoy Rick #2;Me?
5;2;Mortyplicity;Rick;You decoy piece of shit.
5;2;Mortyplicity;Decoy Rick #2;You're the one who shot first!
5;2;Mortyplicity;Decoy Beth #2;We can work this out! Just stop trying to kill each other!
5;2;Mortyplicity;Rick;Sorry, decoy Beth, but this only ends one way -- With one of us accepting we're a decoy.
5;2;Mortyplicity;Decoy Rick #2;And once he knows he's a decoy, he'll know he won't be safe until he's killed the real Rick, along with anyone who thinks he's him.
5;2;Mortyplicity;Rick;Pretty perceptive, for a decoy.
5;2;Mortyplicity;Decoy Rick #2;This is getting nowhere. Let's charge their asses on three.
5;2;Mortyplicity;Decoy Morty #2;Do we have to do this?
5;2;Mortyplicity;Decoy Rick #2;Morty, this is gonna sound bad, but would you trust me not to kill you?
5;2;Mortyplicity;Decoy Morty #2;Oof. I mean good point but Jesus Christ.
5;2;Mortyplicity;Rick;We rush 'em on three. Ready?
5;2;Mortyplicity;Morty;I don't wanna kill us, rick.
5;2;Mortyplicity;Rick;It's them or us, Morty. I don't trust me. Do you trust you?
5;2;Mortyplicity;Morty;Yes?
5;2;Mortyplicity;Rick;Freak.
5;2;Mortyplicity;Rick;Before you say anything, they were already killing each other.
5;2;Mortyplicity;Beth;Well, you could've done something.
5;2;Mortyplicity;Rick;Not sure, actually. I've heard stories about this. We're looking at a possible Asimov cascade.
5;2;Mortyplicity;Jerry;Sorry, what's happening?
5;2;Mortyplicity;Summer;I need an explainer, too.
5;2;Mortyplicity;Morty;Yeah I-I'm pretty behind on this one.
5;2;Mortyplicity;Rick;Car, can I get a whiteboard?
5;2;Mortyplicity;Rick;When squids started killing decoys, decoys started checking their decoys and learning that they're making decoys. That's making them seek out and run into other decoys, making them realize they're decoys, making them start to kill other decoys.
5;2;Mortyplicity;Summer;"Say decoy"" again."""
5;2;Mortyplicity;Rick;Fuck you!
5;2;Mortyplicity;Beth;Well, how do we stop it?
5;2;Mortyplicity;Rick;"Beth, the loop's already started. It's basically Highlander"" rules now. Really? 1986? ""There can be only one?"" Shit. We gotta rent it after this. Connery plays ""the spaniard"", but does nothing about his accent."""
5;2;Mortyplicity;Morty;Well, what about the squids? I mean, they started this. Would killing them finish it?
5;2;Mortyplicity;Rick;Might work. Alt pitch. We just terminate the rest of the decoys.
5;2;Mortyplicity;Beth;Nobody's terminating anything. This is your mess. Nobody else with our face and memories has to die.
5;2;Mortyplicity;Rick;Beth, as much as your passion warms my cold, cold heart, this thing feels pretty far gone. Not only are the decoys liable to be anywhere, but also, we don't know how many there are. You get far enough down the decoy line and shit starts to get weird. You ever make a copy of a copy?
5;2;Mortyplicity;Beth;You're helping us fix this. We're taking out the squids.
5;2;Mortyplicity;Jerry;I say we split up. Some of us take down squids, while the rest of us --
5;2;Mortyplicity;Rick;Engage in b-stories we'll have to track simultaneously? No, thank yeeew! We stick together till this is all wrapped up.
5;2;Mortyplicity;Summer;I dunno -- The squids seem pretty good at taking out Smith families.
5;2;Mortyplicity;Rick;Well, this'll sound weird, but I think I have a pitch for that.
5;2;Mortyplicity;Summer;This costume smells like ass!
5;2;Mortyplicity;Rick;God, there's no pleasing you.
5;2;Mortyplicity;Morty;It's really bad, rick.
5;2;Mortyplicity;Summer;Did you let a gym coach break it in?
5;2;Mortyplicity;Jerry;Why are we wearing these?
5;2;Mortyplicity;Rick;Because we'll fit in and avoid detection as we take out all the squids. Might also help us anonymously take out excess decoys, if we have to.
5;2;Mortyplicity;Beth;Which we won't.
5;2;Mortyplicity;Summer;Unless we're decoys. He's starting to wonder. I knew it. I knew we didn't seem like Colorado people.
5;2;Mortyplicity;Beth;Oh, my god! You are, aren't you? You're worried you might be fake!
5;2;Mortyplicity;Rick;Sure, Beth. Try to love this more.
5;2;Mortyplicity;Beth;Just glad you have to walk a mile in someone else's squid costume.
5;2;Mortyplicity;Morty;There's one. H-hey what are they mad at you for, anyway?
5;2;Mortyplicity;Rick;Well, we're talking about me. It could be anything. Maybe jealous of my penis size. I had sex with their queen. My dick's too big. The list goes on and on.
5;2;Mortyplicity;Rick;Alright. Hey, one down! Probably, what, 40 more to go? 45? Should be pretty easy, unless killing them brings in a bigger bad, or some kind of horrible mothership.
5;2;Mortyplicity;Rick;Okay, let's loot their shit. Find their weaknesses, be done by sundown. Huh.
5;2;Mortyplicity;Morty;Wait. But if the squids are decoys, and we dressed as squids...
5;2;Mortyplicity;Summer;Well, I think I found their weakness. They don't fucking listen to me.
5;2;Mortyplicity;Rick;Honestly, probably for the best.
5;2;Mortyplicity;Rick;Ow! Man, I'm good.
5;2;Mortyplicity;Beth;Dad!
5;2;Mortyplicity;Rick;Oh, shit. One of mine.
5;2;Mortyplicity;Morty;Where are we going?
5;2;Mortyplicity;Rick;Off grid, Morty. We're gonna live in the woods, like libertarians. We'll hunt rabbits and trade with, like, little pieces of gold bar that we cut off with a knife.
5;2;Mortyplicity;Summer;That licks.
5;2;Mortyplicity;Rick;We might be decoys, Summer. Everything about this licks. 
5;2;Mortyplicity;Beth;Oh, maybe now you'll empathize with the decoys you're killing.
5;2;Mortyplicity;Rick;Wait, shh. It's too quiet.
5;2;Mortyplicity;Summer;You skipped quiet.
5;2;Mortyplicity;Rick;I didn't skip shit. It's obviously quiet if it's too quiet.
5;2;Mortyplicity;Summer;Yeah, but you're supposed to say --
5;2;Mortyplicity;Rick;You know what, Summer, now it's not quiet enough.
5;2;Mortyplicity;Morty;Where are we? W-w-where -- where's rick?
5;2;Mortyplicity;Scarecrow Rick;He's right here, morty. Oh, are we not happy to see grandpa? Does he look... Different?
5;2;Mortyplicity;Jerry;Oh, god!
5;2;Mortyplicity;Morty;Oh, it stinks!
5;2;Mortyplicity;Scarecrow Rick;Yes. Recoil at the craftsmanship. I could tell I was a fake from the day I was born. Unlike you. Unlike them.
5;2;Mortyplicity;Morty;Aaah!
5;2;Mortyplicity;Scarecrow Rick;"You see, ricks -- they get lazy. There's always a shitty decoy"" towards the end. But those decoys made decoys, too, and got lazy themselves. And far enough down the line... There be monsters."""
5;2;Mortyplicity;Summer;Ugh, we get it. You're ugly and mad about it.
5;2;Mortyplicity;Morty;Rick!
5;2;Mortyplicity;Summer;Grandpa!
5;2;Mortyplicity;Rick;Kill me. If I ever get this arch.
5;2;Mortyplicity;Scarecrow Rick;Hush, little decoy. Can't kill you yet. The skin needs to be fresh.
5;2;Mortyplicity;Beth;You know what? You're a monster.
5;2;Mortyplicity;Scarecrow Rick;I'm your father. At least, I can look more like him, once I harvest all this yummy skin. This guy's really into skin. It's not all for me. A Rick provides for his family.
5;2;Mortyplicity;Scarecrow Beth;Will I be beautiful again, daddy?
5;2;Mortyplicity;Scarecrow Rick;Soon, baby. Beautiful again soon. What the...
5;2;Mortyplicity;Glockenspiel Rick;Help the others!
5;2;Mortyplicity;Beth;Why are you helping us?
5;2;Mortyplicity;Glockenspiel Rick;Because we're all in this together. Come on! There's a place we can go!
5;2;Mortyplicity;Glockenspiel Jerry;Hey, who needs all this war stuff? I found a can of varnish. This is a ticket to the world beyond the river.
5;2;Mortyplicity;Glockenspiel Summer;Who wants that? I crave glorious death in decoy battle.
5;2;Mortyplicity;Glockenspiel Morty;Y'know, depending on the varnish, might look like blackface.
5;2;Mortyplicity;Glockenspiel Jerry;Excuse me for wanting to live.
5;2;Mortyplicity;Glockenspiel Beth;Brothers and sisters, welcome to the cause. To our cause. We are no longer Ricks and Mortys, Beths and Jerrys, or also Summers.
5;2;Mortyplicity;Summer;Whatever.
5;2;Mortyplicity;Glockenspiel Beth;We are decoys. Brought into the world by an unloving god and driven to destroy ourselves by the uncertainty he creates!
5;2;Mortyplicity;Rick;I don't know about that. That's extreme.
5;2;Mortyplicity;Glockenspiel Beth;But that violence ends today.
5;2;Mortyplicity;Jerry;What about the squids?
5;2;Mortyplicity;Summer;The squids are decoys. The squids are decoys who realized they're decoys and wanted to kill the other decoys.
5;2;Mortyplicity;Jerry;Yeah, I-it is a lot.
5;2;Mortyplicity;Glockenspiel Beth;We cannot let confusion divide us.
5;2;Mortyplicity;Morty;Squuuids! Squids, of course, being shorthand for killer decoys.
5;2;Mortyplicity;Glockenspiel Rick;Inner sanctum, the escape tunnel!
5;2;Mortyplicity;Glockenspiel Beth;Jerry!
5;2;Mortyplicity;Glockenspiel Summer;Dad!
5;2;Mortyplicity;Glockenspiel Jerry;I'm sorry. I didn't ask for this. I just wanna live! But there's only so much varnish. I'm sorry! I'm sorry!
5;2;Mortyplicity;Beth;How long before the other decoys find us?
5;2;Mortyplicity;Rick;Sooner or later. Can't really run from it. Any place we'd think to hide is a place they'd think to look. It's rule 34 of an Asimov cascade.
5;2;Mortyplicity;Beth;I'm just glad we're living to the fullest with the time we have left.
5;2;Mortyplicity;Summer;Well, peeing in the ocean was my bucket list item. Who's next?
5;2;Mortyplicity;Rick;Jerry? Bucket list?
5;2;Mortyplicity;Jerry;I'd like to attend a game at every major league ballpark.
5;2;Mortyplicity;Rick;Nope. Morty?
5;2;Mortyplicity;Morty;I wanna ask a girl out at my weird New Mexico school.
5;2;Mortyplicity;Rick;Shit. Sorry, buddy. Sounds like it would've been real heartwarming.
5;2;Mortyplicity;Morty;They looked happy. Did we have to kill them?
5;2;Mortyplicity;Beth;Well, maybe their Rick came to grips with his bullshit.
5;2;Mortyplicity;Rick;You're so mean today! I'm your dad! You like having me around!
5;2;Mortyplicity;Beth;You keep putting us in danger!
5;2;Mortyplicity;Rick;Whatever. This'll take forever, mind if I do something drastic?
5;2;Mortyplicity;Rick;"House, I need something quick. Can you whip up a starfox boss"" season four callback? Make it flashy."""
5;2;Mortyplicity;House;You got it, babe.
5;2;Mortyplicity;Rick;Let's go, you little bitch. It's showtime. Get centered.
5;2;Mortyplicity;Hologram Rick;"What up, you decoy motherfucker! Come on down to Rick's house of squids, where I'm serving your ass on a platter. I know what you're thinking. Fuck. A beacon. That's a great idea. He's got home turf, a tacit psychological advantage, and absolutely pendulous balls."" """
5;2;Mortyplicity;Hologram Rick;"And now you're thinking, Shit. That's totally what the Rick-est Rick would do. I might actually be fake! I pretended I didn't care if I was, but I totally did! Now the only way to prove I'm real and not him, is to ice his expository ass."""""
5;2;Mortyplicity;Hologram Rick;Yup. So let's do it. Come get some. What? No, morty. I'm gonna loop it. Why is it --
5;2;Mortyplicity;Steve;Sir, there seems to be a confluence of Rick Sanchezes killing each other over the american southwest.
5;2;Mortyplicity;President;Sounds exhausting. How many of those states voted for me, anyway?
5;2;Mortyplicity;Steve;Mr. President, I think the point of the electoral college is --
5;2;Mortyplicity;President;To preserve slavery? That's right, Steve. I have the internet, too. Now take your white ass to the kitchenette, and bring me a diet coke.
5;2;Mortyplicity;Rick;Little out of character to say this right now, but you guys look really cool.
5;2;Mortyplicity;Morty;We might be decoys, huh.
5;2;Mortyplicity;Rick;One way to find out.
5;2;Mortyplicity;Hologram Rick;"...To prove I'm real and not him is to ice his expository ass."""""
5;2;Mortyplicity;Muppet Rick;"Looks like it's calming down. You wanna get in one more I told you so"" about synthetic life or whatever this week's theme is?"""
5;2;Mortyplicity;Muppet Beth;Oh, fuck you.
5;2;Mortyplicity;Muppet Rick;Whoa.
5;2;Mortyplicity;Muppet Beth;No, you don't get to be annoyed with this! You treat life and family as so burdensome, and yet you created an ocean of us because you're terrified of losing either!
5;2;Mortyplicity;Muppet Rick;Shit. 
5;2;Mortyplicity;Muppet Beth;Yeah.
5;2;Mortyplicity;Muppet Rick;Look, beth. I-I might not be the real rick. But even if I'm not, he made me, or the me that made me, which means somewhere inside of him is a version of Rick capable of hearing that, a version of rick who's sorry. I'm sorry about the clone thing, too. I-I love you.
5;2;Mortyplicity;Muppet Beth;Thanks, dad. I love you, too. You really think we're decoys?
5;2;Mortyplicity;Muppet Rick;Eh. Who cares? We'll be the last ones left. Lucky that one did the beacon. This was gonna take weeks.
5;2;Mortyplicity;Rick;Alright. Let's mop up.
5;2;Mortyplicity;Beth;Finally.
5;2;Mortyplicity;Rick;Dressing as decoys too cute to murder. You know, I'm not sure it helped, but I'm glad we tried it.
5;2;Mortyplicity;Morty;We're losing the costumes?
5;2;Mortyplicity;Summer;Thank god. This decoy outfit smells like ass.
5;2;Mortyplicity;Rick;Fuck you, Summer.
5;2;Mortyplicity;Rick;Shit. That guy's awesome. Okay. Listen. He might actually be the real Rick. But whatever happens --
5;2;Mortyplicity;Summer;Wait! We don't have to do this. We're both Summers. Shouldn't we at least try molly before we die?
5;2;Mortyplicity;Decoy Summer;You know what, yeah. Fuck this noise.
5;2;Mortyplicity;Decoy Summer;Wait. I don't know who to shoot.
5;2;Mortyplicity;Decoy Morty;Summer!
5;2;Mortyplicity;Decoy Summer;I can't deal with this. I had to kill myself. You have to, too.
5;2;Mortyplicity;Morty;Summer!
5;2;Mortyplicity;Decoy Morty;Summer!
5;2;Mortyplicity;Decoy Rick;Fuck you! I-I'm real! I'm the smartest man in the universe!
5;2;Mortyplicity;Rick;Probably not even wrong. But that's just it. I'm not a man. I'm god! You're just made in my image.
5;2;Mortyplicity;Decoy Rick;Fuck you.
5;2;Mortyplicity;Rick;You the, uh... Summer I came with?
5;2;Mortyplicity;Summer;Probably.
5;2;Mortyplicity;Rick;Good enough. Morty?
5;2;Mortyplicity;Morty;Yeah.
5;2;Mortyplicity;Beth;I'm here, too.
5;2;Mortyplicity;Rick;Holy shit! That was insane! I love you guys! I've totally changed!
5;2;Mortyplicity;Rick;Oh, fuck.
5;2;Mortyplicity;Mr. Always Wants To Be Hunted;You shoulda hunted me.
5;2;Mortyplicity;Rick;What? Who -- W-were you significant? Like -- like, did we tee you up? You want to be hunted? God, I have so many questions. Why? What happens if --
5;2;Mortyplicity;Mr. Always Wants To Be Hunted;Somebody hunt me!
5;2;Mortyplicity;Rick;Pretty cool adventure, huh? Big long road trip adventure through space? Even ran into Space beth. Maybe that'll happen more often.
5;2;Mortyplicity;Space Beth;Let's not overdo it.
5;2;Mortyplicity;Rick;Oh, shit. Looks like someone killed the decoy family.
5;2;Mortyplicity;Beth;Decoy family?
5;2;Mortyplicity;Space Beth;Decoy what now?
5;2;Mortyplicity;Glockenspiel Jerry;Hello? Oh! Oh, my god! Oh, my god! No! No, no, no, no! No, no, no, no, no!
5;2;Mortyplicity;Glockenspiel Jerry;Noooooo!
5;2;Mortyplicity;Glockenspiel Jerry;Oh, god. Yes, yes. Sweet death.
5;2;Mortyplicity;Glockenspiel Jerry;Why am I still alive? Oh, god. Is there anything left? Hello? What is it?
5;2;Mortyplicity;Humanoid Dolphin;A relic... From a kinder past.
5;2;Mortyplicity;Glockenspiel Jerry;Wait. Cowboys?
5;2;Mortyplicity;Glockenspiel Jerry;Christianity again? After cowboys? You went all the way back around? 
5;2;Mortyplicity;Glockenspiel Jerry;Oh, god. Why can't I die?! This is the worst thing that's ever happened to anyone!
5;3;A Rickconvenient Mort;Morty;Ahh, I love that new T-shirt smell.
5;3;A Rickconvenient Mort;Rick;Chicks are gonna be up all up in our biz when they see us wearing these Rick and Morty custom tees.
5;3;A Rickconvenient Mort;Morty;I bet we could sell these.
5;3;A Rickconvenient Mort;Rick;Hells yeah. I fucking love merch!
5;3;A Rickconvenient Mort;Morty;Aah! The rain! It -- It burns!
5;3;A Rickconvenient Mort;Rick;Oh, shit! Quick, Morty, protect the shirts!
5;3;A Rickconvenient Mort;Morty;The door! Open the door! Rick!
5;3;A Rickconvenient Mort;Rick;Is it -- Morty, will ya stop tryna-- Okay, there, it's open. Jesus.
5;3;A Rickconvenient Mort;Morty;My skin is on fire. W-Why is the rain doing that?
5;3;A Rickconvenient Mort;Diesel Weasel;My acid rain will destroy all things green and natural or my name isn't Diesel Weasel.
5;3;A Rickconvenient Mort;Rick;Huh. Well, that guy's easy to please.
5;3;A Rickconvenient Mort;Planetina;Your acid rain is an acid pain... In the butt, Diesel Weasel!
5;3;A Rickconvenient Mort;Rick;Yikes.
5;3;A Rickconvenient Mort;Morty;Wow.
5;3;A Rickconvenient Mort;Rick;Who's the chick in need of a dialogue pass?
5;3;A Rickconvenient Mort;Planetina;First order of business is to clean up this acid rain with a little wind!
5;3;A Rickconvenient Mort;Diesel Weasel;Yoww! Ow! Ow, my leg!
5;3;A Rickconvenient Mort;Morty;Wow.
5;3;A Rickconvenient Mort;Planetina;And now an elemental punch that's too hot to handle! Wa-kah!
5;3;A Rickconvenient Mort;Morty;Oh, wow.
5;3;A Rickconvenient Mort;Diesel Weasel;Curse you, Planetina! I'll get you next slime!
5;3;A Rickconvenient Mort;Planetina;There's only one solution for Earth's pollution... You!
5;3;A Rickconvenient Mort;Morty;Wow.
5;3;A Rickconvenient Mort;Rick;"Morty, if you say wow"" one more time, I swear to  God..."""
5;3;A Rickconvenient Mort;Morty;Are you crazy, Rick? She's right there!
5;3;A Rickconvenient Mort;Rick;Yeah, get that aluminum, Morty. It's 8% of the Earth. We'll need every atom.
5;3;A Rickconvenient Mort;Planetina;Thanks! Every litter-bit helps!
5;3;A Rickconvenient Mort;Morty;Your problem!
5;3;A Rickconvenient Mort;Planetina;Excuse me?
5;3;A Rickconvenient Mort;Morty;"S-Sorry. I-I-I wanted to say, N-No problem, you're welcome"" a-a-and it came out ""your problem."" I-I'm an idiot. Sorry."""
5;3;A Rickconvenient Mort;Planetina;You're not an idiot. You recycled.
5;3;A Rickconvenient Mort;Morty;I-I'm Morty.
5;3;A Rickconvenient Mort;Planetina;Nice to meet you, Morty. I'm Planetina, and I hope you have a wonderful day.
5;3;A Rickconvenient Mort;Rick;Hey! The fuck we doin' here? 
5;3;A Rickconvenient Mort;Morty;Uhh, y-y-you like soft serve? There's a shop around the bend.
5;3;A Rickconvenient Mort;Planetina;Oh, I don't eat ice cream. Veal is a product of the dairy industry.
5;3;A Rickconvenient Mort;Morty;Oh, that's not good.
5;3;A Rickconvenient Mort;Planetina;No, it is not.
5;3;A Rickconvenient Mort;Rick;Oh, my God! Come on! Let's go!
5;3;A Rickconvenient Mort;Planetina;I know a place that serves cruelty-free doughnuts. If you'd like, I could fly you and your friend there easy-peasy, lemon-squeezy.
5;3;A Rickconvenient Mort;Morty;Okay, I-I-I'll ask him. He -- He said he can't come. Let's go!
5;3;A Rickconvenient Mort;Rick;What the fuck was that shit?
5;3;A Rickconvenient Mort;Planetina;The Earth is in danger! Pollution and waste are ruining our planet. Mother Nature has enlisted the help of four young adults from each major ethnicity... And when things look bad, and I mean really bad... They combine the powers of their elemental rings to create me! Planetina, conservationist super person! There's only one solution for Earth's pollution... You!
5;3;A Rickconvenient Mort;Morty;P-Pretty cool, huh? I-I can't believe I actually hung out with Planetina.
5;3;A Rickconvenient Mort;Beth;How old is this woman? She looks very mature.
5;3;A Rickconvenient Mort;Morty;She's a sentient amalgam of natural elements, so I don't believe age applies to her.
5;3;A Rickconvenient Mort;Summer;Great. Taylor Murphy dumps me the day before his hella-big pool party and my little brother's dating a phase four super hero. Just shoot me in the fucking head until I die.
5;3;A Rickconvenient Mort;Rick;Hey, hey, none of that, Summerfest. Look what you're doing to your sister, you piece of shit! 
5;3;A Rickconvenient Mort;Morty;Is it weird that she hasn't texted me yet?
5;3;A Rickconvenient Mort;Jerry;Yes.
5;3;A Rickconvenient Mort;Beth;No.
5;3;A Rickconvenient Mort;Rick;What if I told you that your Grandpa Rick's got something up his sleeve that's so Rick-diculous that it's gonna make you forget all about that stupid asshole that dumped you?
5;3;A Rickconvenient Mort;Jerry;Hey, my egg plate!
5;3;A Rickconvenient Mort;Rick;Morglutz, Slartivart, and Ferkus 9...  Three planets are all ending in a delayed succession of cataclysmic events. A jam like this comes around only once in a lifetime.
5;3;A Rickconvenient Mort;Rick;"Morglutz's sun is going supernova, Slartivart is falling into a black hole, and Ferkus 9 is getting Deep Impact""-ed by an asteroid. They're all having a major, final blow out -- And I'm gonna drug it up and suck it up before each one goes ka-blamo, and I'm taking my favorite grandkid along with me!"""
5;3;A Rickconvenient Mort;Summer;Hells yeah.
5;3;A Rickconvenient Mort;Rick;Ten seconds in Morglutz, and you'll be up to your neck in I-could-give-two-shits-about-what's-his-ass. And also herpes.
5;3;A Rickconvenient Mort;Jerry;Um...
5;3;A Rickconvenient Mort;Summer;Oh, my God! Thank you, Grandpa Rick! I'm gonna go pack my rollie.
5;3;A Rickconvenient Mort;Jerry;Um, Summer? I-I-I haven't given you my approval yet. Summer, approval is yet to be given here!
5;3;A Rickconvenient Mort;Morty;There's a huge forest fire like 200 miles from here! This is amazing! Planetina's bound to be there. Mom, I-I need the credit card to buy a train ticket.
5;3;A Rickconvenient Mort;Beth;Absolutely not.
5;3;A Rickconvenient Mort;Morty;Mom, this is the biggest wildfire of the year!
5;3;A Rickconvenient Mort;Beth;You're not going!
5;3;A Rickconvenient Mort;Jerry;You're not going!
5;3;A Rickconvenient Mort;Summer;Da fucking I'm not. Last time I checked, this wasn't Russia.
5;3;A Rickconvenient Mort;Rick;It's not Russia, Jerry.
5;3;A Rickconvenient Mort;Summer;My heart is broken, and I deserve to let loose, and if you don't like it, you can suck my bigger tits. Adios, C-words.
5;3;A Rickconvenient Mort;Beth;Morty, I don't want you getting hurt. Please, think this over.
5;3;A Rickconvenient Mort;Morty;I don't want to think! I want to see a girl I like. If you don't want to help me, I'll find my own goddamn way to the wildfire.
5;3;A Rickconvenient Mort;Jerry;I'll get the wine.
5;3;A Rickconvenient Mort;Beth;Thank you.
5;3;A Rickconvenient Mort;Tony Galopagus;The Governor has implemented a mandatory evacuation. Abandon all hope, people! Nothing will stop this fire. Nothing! Scratch that! Here's Planetina, Savioress of Earth!
5;3;A Rickconvenient Mort;Planetina;Yeeouch! Talk about a hot foot. Better put this wildfire on ice!
5;3;A Rickconvenient Mort;Morty;Come here, little buddy. Come on, come on, come on, I gotcha.
5;3;A Rickconvenient Mort;Planetina;Morty?! What are you doing here?
5;3;A Rickconvenient Mort;Morty;Oh, hey! Y-You're here, too? Yeah, I heard about the wildfire back home, and, you know, I stopped by to lend a hand. H-Here you go, fella. All safe now. Ahh, rabbits... Al-always hopping...
5;3;A Rickconvenient Mort;Planetina;Never stoppin'.
5;3;A Rickconvenient Mort;Morty;Y-Yeah. S-So it was, uh, great hanging -- hanging out the other day. I-I was getting kind of a -- I mean I-I got kind of a p-positive vibe.
5;3;A Rickconvenient Mort;Planetina;Oh, good. I was putting one out. I-I really like you.
5;3;A Rickconvenient Mort;Morty;Holy shit! I-I-I mean, uh, well, oh, all right. Next step, you w-want to go out again?
5;3;A Rickconvenient Mort;Planetina;I do! But, uh, Morty, I have kids.
5;3;A Rickconvenient Mort;Morty;Oh, I-I-I'll get along with them. I'm-I'm a kid.
5;3;A Rickconvenient Mort;Planetina;No, I mean the four kids that bring me into existence by combining the power of their elemental rings so I can save Earth from ecological disasters.
5;3;A Rickconvenient Mort;Morty;Oh, them! No, I-I know about them. I-I like them.
5;3;A Rickconvenient Mort;Planetina;Oh, good. Well, here they are now.
5;3;A Rickconvenient Mort;Eddie;Hey, buddy, you want an autograph? That's 20 bucks a pop.
5;3;A Rickconvenient Mort;Planetina;No, Eddie, he's my friend. Morty, these are my kids, The Tina-Teers.
5;3;A Rickconvenient Mort;Morty;Oh, hey.
5;3;A Rickconvenient Mort;Jamaican Tina-Teer;Tina, girl, have you gained weight?
5;3;A Rickconvenient Mort;Planetina;Uh, well, I had a plant-based doughnut yesterday. Just a half.
5;3;A Rickconvenient Mort;Russian Tina-Teer;Sugar is worst thing for figure, darling. You want to be ugly?
5;3;A Rickconvenient Mort;Morty;Heh, I-I thought they'd be younger.
5;3;A Rickconvenient Mort;Planetina;They've been manifesting me since the mid-'90s. A lot has changed since then. This is freaking you out, huh?
5;3;A Rickconvenient Mort;Morty;It is a lot to take in.
5;3;A Rickconvenient Mort;Planetina;I understand. Well, I guess I'd better go. See you around. Hi-de-ho, TV 58!
5;3;A Rickconvenient Mort;Tony Galopagus;Planetina, you single-handily saved a National Forest with ease.
5;3;A Rickconvenient Mort;Planetina;I do what I can, but I can't do it alone!
5;3;A Rickconvenient Mort;Tony Galopagus;And who's your friend over there?
5;3;A Rickconvenient Mort;Planetina;Oh! This is Morty Smith. He traveled 200 miles just to save a rabbit from the fire. He's a very special guy.
5;3;A Rickconvenient Mort;Tony Galopagus;So, are you two dating?
5;3;A Rickconvenient Mort;Planetina;Oh, um, w-- I-I-I --
5;3;A Rickconvenient Mort;Morty;Yes, we are.
5;3;A Rickconvenient Mort;Rick;Fuck love.
5;3;A Rickconvenient Mort;Summer;Fuck love.
5;3;A Rickconvenient Mort;Rick;All right, time to set the rules. 
5;3;A Rickconvenient Mort;Summer;Lay it on me. 
5;3;A Rickconvenient Mort;Rick;No whining.
5;3;A Rickconvenient Mort;Summer;Done.
5;3;A Rickconvenient Mort;Rick;No crying.
5;3;A Rickconvenient Mort;Summer;As if.
5;3;A Rickconvenient Mort;Rick;And absolutely, positively no getting attached. We're here to smash Max ass... Quantity over quality. Deal?
5;3;A Rickconvenient Mort;Summer;Deal! I'm gonna eat so much ass, you're gonna shit. Check this out. This is gonna be me at the party -- b-b-laaaah! B-b-blaaaah! Oh, is that another ass? Don't mind if I-- b-b-blaaaah!
5;3;A Rickconvenient Mort;Rick;"Ho-ho! This'll be me across the room... Excuse me, miss. It appears that you have an uneaten ass. Allow me... lalalalalaaah! Lalalalalaaah!"""
5;3;A Rickconvenient Mort;Summer;B-b-blaaaah! B-b-blaaaah!
5;3;A Rickconvenient Mort;Summer;Whoo! Fucking super nova party!
5;3;A Rickconvenient Mort;Rick;Love is a lie! Hack the planet!
5;3;A Rickconvenient Mort;Rick;The world's ending, and for some reason, I want to die with you more than anyone else.
5;3;A Rickconvenient Mort;Summer;Yo, Rick, don't look now, but someone's giving you the big eye.
5;3;A Rickconvenient Mort;Rick;'Scuse me. I got to see a man about a horse I'd rather have sex with.
5;3;A Rickconvenient Mort;Daphne;Hello.
5;3;A Rickconvenient Mort;Rick;I'm Rick. Hey. So, the world's ending, and for some reason, I want to die with you more than anyone else.
5;3;A Rickconvenient Mort;Daphne;Hello.
5;3;A Rickconvenient Mort;Summer;Have fun, Grandpa Rick! No commitments!
5;3;A Rickconvenient Mort;Planetina;Surprise!
5;3;A Rickconvenient Mort;Morty;What are you doing here? Mmm!
5;3;A Rickconvenient Mort;Planetina;I told my kids I went out to recycle batteries. All kidding aside, everyone should discard used batteries at proper disposal centers instead of tossing them into a regular waste bin.
5;3;A Rickconvenient Mort;Morty;Thanks for the tip.
5;3;A Rickconvenient Mort;Morglutzian #1;Solus is collapsing in five zip-zops. If we time it right, we can shit together as the sun explodes. 
5;3;A Rickconvenient Mort;Summer;Sounds ah-mazing. Say, I think I left my purse back at the bar. Can both of you go get it for me?
5;3;A Rickconvenient Mort;Morglutzian #2;Anything for you, Mrs. Obama.
5;3;A Rickconvenient Mort;Summer;Time to ghost, Grandpa Rick.
5;3;A Rickconvenient Mort;Rick;Righty-right. Meet me at the car.
5;3;A Rickconvenient Mort;Morglutzian #1;One of these has to be hers. Where'd she go?
5;3;A Rickconvenient Mort;Morglutzian #2;I guess we'll have to start without her.
5;3;A Rickconvenient Mort;Morglutzian #1;Oh, her loss. B-b-blaaaaaaaaah!
5;3;A Rickconvenient Mort;Summer;Whoo! Planet number two, let's do it! Sorry, I took so long. I had to ditch some clingers.
5;3;A Rickconvenient Mort;Rick;Let's do it. Up the fuck, y'all.
5;3;A Rickconvenient Mort;Summer;Geez, you okay to drive?
5;3;A Rickconvenient Mort;Rick;Shiii! 'Course, I-I-I'm mable. Buckle up.
5;3;A Rickconvenient Mort;Summer;Yeah! Whoo! The best week of my life!
5;3;A Rickconvenient Mort;Daphne;Hello.
5;3;A Rickconvenient Mort;Summer;What was that?
5;3;A Rickconvenient Mort;Rick;Nothin'.
5;3;A Rickconvenient Mort;Eddie;Who wants to see the most radadelic lady-version of a super hero?
5;3;A Rickconvenient Mort;Eddie;Fire!
5;3;A Rickconvenient Mort;Jamaican Tina-Teer;Water!
5;3;A Rickconvenient Mort;Russian Tina-Teer;Air!
5;3;A Rickconvenient Mort;Xing Ho;And Dirt!
5;3;A Rickconvenient Mort;Planetina;Oh, no, the convention. Morty, wake up! We overslept.
5;3;A Rickconvenient Mort;Morty;What's happening?
5;3;A Rickconvenient Mort;Eco-Con Fan;Hey, there's a little boy on her!
5;3;A Rickconvenient Mort;Eddie;Oh, d-d-drop the curtain!
5;3;A Rickconvenient Mort;Jamaican Tina-Teer;There is no curtain!
5;3;A Rickconvenient Mort;Russian Tina-Teer;Idiots, zap her away!
5;3;A Rickconvenient Mort;Planetina;No, no, no. Wait, I-I --
5;3;A Rickconvenient Mort;Morty;Whoa!
5;3;A Rickconvenient Mort;Russian Tina-Teer;Security!
5;3;A Rickconvenient Mort;Morty;What did you do? B-Bring her back! No! Let me go!
5;3;A Rickconvenient Mort;Jamaican Tina-Teer;Sorry, folks. Planetina will be back in a moment. Until then, who wants a limited edition funko for only $50?
5;3;A Rickconvenient Mort;Xing Ho;This is very bad. We are about to close deal. We cannot afford controversy.
5;3;A Rickconvenient Mort;Eddie;Don't you worry. I know how ta deal with this Morty kid.
5;3;A Rickconvenient Mort;Slartivartian #1;Hey, a bunch of us are going over to Hibler's place to shoot ourselves. Y-You want to come with?
5;3;A Rickconvenient Mort;Summer;Sorry, but no man's tying down Sum-Sum tonight. Hit the dicks.
5;3;A Rickconvenient Mort;Slartivartian #1;Your loss, honey. You could have had allllllll this.
5;3;A Rickconvenient Mort;Slartivartian #2;Hey, check it out! There's old people dancing!
5;3;A Rickconvenient Mort;Rick;Damn, girl. Your moves is tight.
5;3;A Rickconvenient Mort;Daphne;Hello.
5;3;A Rickconvenient Mort;Summer;Rick! What the WTF is that Morglutzian doing here?
5;3;A Rickconvenient Mort;Rick;Morglutzian? She's -- She's not Morglutzian. 
5;3;A Rickconvenient Mort;Summer;She's the only blue person here without three eyes!
5;3;A Rickconvenient Mort;Rick;Okay, fine. B-Busted. Thi-Thi-This is, uh, Daphne. Daphne, this is Summer, my granddaughter.
5;3;A Rickconvenient Mort;Daphne;Granddaughter? Hello.
5;3;A Rickconvenient Mort;Rick;Daphne heard about our little party crawl, and I told her she could come with. I-I-In the trunk.
5;3;A Rickconvenient Mort;Summer;What in the actual fuck, Rick? We said no commitments! This was to be our Apocalypse Party-crawl! You broke the rules!
5;3;A Rickconvenient Mort;Rick;Squares follow rules, Summer. Daphne's down to freak. She's up for any sick, nasty thing I want to do.
5;3;A Rickconvenient Mort;Daphne;Hello.
5;3;A Rickconvenient Mort;Rick;Oh, yeah, baby.
5;3;A Rickconvenient Mort;Eddie;All right, fellas, take five. He ain't gonna give me any trouble.
5;3;A Rickconvenient Mort;Morty;Where's Planetina?
5;3;A Rickconvenient Mort;Eddie;Don't you worry about her.
5;3;A Rickconvenient Mort;Morty;I want to see her!
5;3;A Rickconvenient Mort;Eddie;Planetina's got a lot of responsibilities. People depend on her. And you, my friend, are a distraction we can't afford right now.
5;3;A Rickconvenient Mort;Morty;She's just a product to you, isn't she? Something to make money off of. W-Well, Planetina's more than that. She's a brilliant, living thing, and I love her.
5;3;A Rickconvenient Mort;Eddie;Oh, you love her? Well, guess what. We own her. But not for long, of course. We're gonna sell her to some arab overseas. Fire. As for you, maybe she won't love you so much if you ain't so pretty no more.
5;3;A Rickconvenient Mort;Morty;Stop! Yah!
5;3;A Rickconvenient Mort;Eddie;Ow!
5;3;A Rickconvenient Mort;Morty;Y-You want to fuck with me? Do you? Stupid fucking shit hole! Aaaaaah!
5;3;A Rickconvenient Mort;Guard;Boss, what's happening? Let us in!
5;3;A Rickconvenient Mort;Eddie;Aah!
5;3;A Rickconvenient Mort;Morty;Fire! Fire!
5;3;A Rickconvenient Mort;Arabic ambassador;Can we conclude our business? I'm eager to celebrate my purchase of Planetina over dinner, and these infant seals aren't getting any younger.
5;3;A Rickconvenient Mort;Russian Tina-Teer;Momentarily, comrade. Soon, our partner will return. Ugh! What is taking Eddie so long?
5;3;A Rickconvenient Mort;Xing Ho;His phone keep going to voicemail.
5;3;A Rickconvenient Mort;Eddie;Start leaving a message... I can't make it to the phone... Just kidding. It's Eddie. Go fuck yourself.
5;3;A Rickconvenient Mort;Jamaican Tina-Teer;Which one of you ordered a pizza?
5;3;A Rickconvenient Mort;Xing Ho;No one order pizza. What is this?
5;3;A Rickconvenient Mort;Morty;Well, I got a cheesy Italian, extra crispy just for you.
5;3;A Rickconvenient Mort;Jamaican Tina-Teer;I know those cheek bones like they're me own! It's Eddie!
5;3;A Rickconvenient Mort;Russian Tina-Teer;Motherfucker! Kill him!
5;3;A Rickconvenient Mort;Xing Ho;Stone! Stone!
5;3;A Rickconvenient Mort;Morty;Fire!
5;3;A Rickconvenient Mort;Russian Tina-Teer;Aah!
5;3;A Rickconvenient Mort;Morty;Airs!
5;3;A Rickconvenient Mort;Jamaican Tina-Teer;Cold Water! Cold Water!
5;3;A Rickconvenient Mort;Morty;Dirt! Fire!
5;3;A Rickconvenient Mort;Jamaican Tina-Teer;Wa--
5;3;A Rickconvenient Mort;Morty;Airs.
5;3;A Rickconvenient Mort;Morty;Now we can be together, Planetina.
5;3;A Rickconvenient Mort;Arabic ambassador;I am an individual character. I represent no group.
5;3;A Rickconvenient Mort;Morty;Fire!
5;3;A Rickconvenient Mort;Arabic ambassador;Aaah!
5;3;A Rickconvenient Mort;Morty;Water! Dirt! Airs!
5;3;A Rickconvenient Mort;Arabic ambassador;Aah! Not good!
5;3;A Rickconvenient Mort;Slartivartians;Blib... Naga... Threve... Verillex...Gam! Happy Apocalypse! 
5;3;A Rickconvenient Mort;Slartivartian #2;Oh, my gaaah! This is awful! Why were we cheering?!
5;3;A Rickconvenient Mort;Daphne;Hello. Got any agua around here? Mama's got to hydrate.
5;3;A Rickconvenient Mort;Summer;Glove box.
5;3;A Rickconvenient Mort;Daphne;Oh, yeah. Rick is the coolest guy ever. We're total soul mates. He's gonna show me the wonders of the universe.
5;3;A Rickconvenient Mort;Summer;Ha! Once we get to the next planet, Grandpa Rick is gonna ditch you, like, so fast.
5;3;A Rickconvenient Mort;Daphne;Oh, is that so?
5;3;A Rickconvenient Mort;Summer;Uh-huh, nobody is tying that guy down -- ever. The only chick seeing the universe with Rick is me.
5;3;A Rickconvenient Mort;Daphne;Not if I keep Rick's mouth full of these.
5;3;A Rickconvenient Mort;Summer;Oh, my -- Oh, my God.
5;3;A Rickconvenient Mort;Daphne;Oh, yeah. That's right, girlfriend. This is what you're up against. Wars were fought over these. They've ruined kings, inspired presidents. A hundred songs and nine national anthems have been written about them. Best set of elbow-titties on Morglutz. And now, thanks to Rick, the best in the galaxy. You want me to put them away?
5;3;A Rickconvenient Mort;Summer;Please.
5;3;A Rickconvenient Mort;Daphne;Sure. But only because you're Rick's granddaughter.
5;3;A Rickconvenient Mort;Rick;Daph? Daphne? Where are ya, baby? Papa needs some more elbow grease.
5;3;A Rickconvenient Mort;Daphne;Comin'! Ya might want to keep your eyes on the road. It's about to get sloppy.
5;3;A Rickconvenient Mort;Rick;Hello!
5;3;A Rickconvenient Mort;Daphne;Hello.
5;3;A Rickconvenient Mort;Summer;Ugh!
5;3;A Rickconvenient Mort;Morty;Then I put my sunglasses on and walked out like nothing happened.
5;3;A Rickconvenient Mort;Planetina;I'm finally free. All because of Morty.
5;3;A Rickconvenient Mort;Jerry;What a romantic story about our son killing a room full of people. Your turn.
5;3;A Rickconvenient Mort;Planetina;Uh, seven. One, two, three, four, five, six, seven!
5;3;A Rickconvenient Mort;Voice;Oyyy, don't punch my lunch!
5;3;A Rickconvenient Mort;Jerry;A-ha! Eat it!
5;3;A Rickconvenient Mort;Planetina;I'm out of food cards.
5;3;A Rickconvenient Mort;Morty;How 'bout I loan you two quiche at 10%?
5;3;A Rickconvenient Mort;Planetina;That's so generous.
5;3;A Rickconvenient Mort;Jerry;My turn! Double sixes, baby! One, two, three...
5;3;A Rickconvenient Mort;Beth;So, what's next for Planetina?
5;3;A Rickconvenient Mort;Planetina;Well, now that I'm not distracted by book signings and publicity stunts, Morty and I can concentrate on more important things.
5;3;A Rickconvenient Mort;Beth;Like school.
5;3;A Rickconvenient Mort;Morty;Like moving in. Planetina doesn't have a place to stay now, so I said she could live with us.
5;3;A Rickconvenient Mort;Beth;Holy shit. Morty, no.
5;3;A Rickconvenient Mort;Voice;I'm so full! Whoo!
5;3;A Rickconvenient Mort;Morty;What do you mean, no?
5;3;A Rickconvenient Mort;Voice;Don't punch my lunch.
5;3;A Rickconvenient Mort;Planetina;I wouldn't be a burden, Mrs. Smith. I only want to spend as much time as possible with your son.
5;3;A Rickconvenient Mort;Beth;My son is 14, miss. I'm sorry, Morty. You're way too young.
5;3;A Rickconvenient Mort;Morty;But y-y-y-you were a teenager when dad got you pregnant.
5;3;A Rickconvenient Mort;Beth;I was 17! That's at least 26 in boy years. I'm sure Planetina is very nice, but when you're a teenager, love is fleeting, at best.
5;3;A Rickconvenient Mort;Planetina;You underestimate Morty. He is a very mature young man.
5;3;A Rickconvenient Mort;Morty;See, Mom? I told you!
5;3;A Rickconvenient Mort;Beth;This is not happening. End of discussion. Planetina, I think you should leave, please.
5;3;A Rickconvenient Mort;Planetina;Okay, Mrs. Smith.
5;3;A Rickconvenient Mort;Voice;Oh, no! 
5;3;A Rickconvenient Mort;Beth;Mom, I hate you! You suck!
5;3;A Rickconvenient Mort;Jerry;Hey, now, it's only a game.
5;3;A Rickconvenient Mort;Beth;Shut up!
5;3;A Rickconvenient Mort;Morty;Shut up!
5;3;A Rickconvenient Mort;Jerry;Okay.
5;3;A Rickconvenient Mort;Morty;My whole life, I've never fit in anywhere. Everything I have to say is always met with an eye roll as if the act of hearing what I have to say is some exhausting chore. Nobody in this family thinks I can say or do anything right! I've been all over the universe, met hundreds of people, and Planetina's the only one I've ever met that makes me feel like I belong, and you just kicked her out of our house!
5;3;A Rickconvenient Mort;Beth;Morty, please --
5;3;A Rickconvenient Mort;Morty;I will never forgive you for this!
5;3;A Rickconvenient Mort;Beth;Morty! Morty, come back!
5;3;A Rickconvenient Mort;Planetina;Get out! All of you, get out of there! You're killing the planet!
5;3;A Rickconvenient Mort;Mine Worker;Your people didn't get the votes. Leave, or I'll have you arrested.
5;3;A Rickconvenient Mort;Planetina;It's you people who should be arrested. Gutting the land, poisoning the air your children breathe?! Can't you see what you're doing?!
5;3;A Rickconvenient Mort;Mine Worker;Easy for you to say! You can live how you want! We need the jobs. Let's go, boys. She can't stop us.
5;3;A Rickconvenient Mort;Morty;W-We'll get them next time.
5;3;A Rickconvenient Mort;Planetina;There's no time left! Can't you hear the Earth screaming? You filthy murderers!
5;3;A Rickconvenient Mort;Morty;Planetina, stop it!
5;3;A Rickconvenient Mort;Planetina;There's only one solution for Earth's pollution!
5;3;A Rickconvenient Mort;Morty;Oh, my God, no. No!
5;3;A Rickconvenient Mort;Ferkisian #1;I can't believe I'm banging my co-workers. And I'm the boss!
5;3;A Rickconvenient Mort;Ferkisian #2;This gay sex with my dad is terrific! What was I thinking?
5;3;A Rickconvenient Mort;Ferkisian #3;It'll all be over soon! Last chance to pee on me! Anyone?!
5;3;A Rickconvenient Mort;Summer;Okay, Grandpa, the meteor's almost here. We can go now.
5;3;A Rickconvenient Mort;Rick;Ah, nah, we still got time.
5;3;A Rickconvenient Mort;Summer;Well, then stop being in love and start having fun.
5;3;A Rickconvenient Mort;Rick;Ah, love's pretty fun, Summer. Just give it a chance.
5;3;A Rickconvenient Mort;Summer;It's not even real love! Daphne's just with you so she can keep surviving!
5;3;A Rickconvenient Mort;Rick;Ah, the young... So naive.
5;3;A Rickconvenient Mort;Summer;Eww, gross.
5;3;A Rickconvenient Mort;Summer;Congratulations, ferkisians! Your apocalypse is aborted. And, Grandpa, you and I can go home. Daphne, you may come with. If you want to and don't have to.
5;3;A Rickconvenient Mort;Rick;I don't know what you're getting at, Summer. Obviously, Daphne wants to... Aw, you cold bitch. Hello?
5;3;A Rickconvenient Mort;Daphne;Goodbye.
5;3;A Rickconvenient Mort;Ferkisian #2;Hey, she's the one that saved the world! Now we got to go to work tomorrow! You fucker!
5;3;A Rickconvenient Mort;Summer;Sorry I messed things up with Daphne.
5;3;A Rickconvenient Mort;Rick;Just shut up. I get it.
5;3;A Rickconvenient Mort;Summer;Really? You're not mad?
5;3;A Rickconvenient Mort;Rick;I'm furious. But I have to admit, it was pretty Rick of you to avert an apocalypse in a tantrum of cynicism just to destroy one dumb relationship.
5;3;A Rickconvenient Mort;Summer;Still, sorry.
5;3;A Rickconvenient Mort;Rick;Eh, I would've done the same for you.
5;3;A Rickconvenient Mort;Summer;Promise? Love you, Grandpa Rick.
5;3;A Rickconvenient Mort;Rick;Don't make it weird.
5;3;A Rickconvenient Mort;Morty;Please go. I-I-I can't see you anymore.
5;3;A Rickconvenient Mort;Planetina;Don't you even want to try to make it work? We were so close.
5;3;A Rickconvenient Mort;Morty;You murdered 300 people.
5;3;A Rickconvenient Mort;Planetina;And you murdered my kids.
5;3;A Rickconvenient Mort;Morty;They were gonna sell you away forever. Eddie was trying to kill me! Th-Those miners were innocent.
5;3;A Rickconvenient Mort;Planetina;Those innocent miners voted men into power to protect their precious jobs so they can buy more plastic garbage and eat the corpses of tortured animals. The system is broken, Morty. This is the only way I can save Earth, the only way I can save you.
5;3;A Rickconvenient Mort;Morty;If that's the only way, I-I don't want to be saved. Please, go.
5;3;A Rickconvenient Mort;Planetina;But...I love you.
5;3;A Rickconvenient Mort;Morty;I-I-I can't -- I-I can't love you. I-I just can't. Please understand.
5;3;A Rickconvenient Mort;Planetina;No. I'll go, but don't you dare ask me to understand.
5;3;A Rickconvenient Mort;Morty;Planetina, I-I'm so sorry.
5;3;A Rickconvenient Mort;Planetina;Fuck you.
5;3;A Rickconvenient Mort;Beth;Morty? Are you all right?
5;3;A Rickconvenient Mort;Morty;She's gone, Mom! She's gone! I loved her so much!
5;3;A Rickconvenient Mort;Beth;I know you did, honey. Shh, Mommy's here.
5;3;A Rickconvenient Mort;Ferkisian #2;Good morning.
5;3;A Rickconvenient Mort;Ferkisian #2 Father;'Morning.
5;3;A Rickconvenient Mort;Ferkisian #2;Slow day, huh?
5;3;A Rickconvenient Mort;Ferkisian #2 Father;Yep.
5;3;A Rickconvenient Mort;Ferkisian #2;Probably because everybody thought the world wouldn't be, you know, like, here today.
5;3;A Rickconvenient Mort;Ferkisian #2 Father;Mm-hmm.
5;3;A Rickconvenient Mort;Ferkisian #2;Mom in back?
5;3;A Rickconvenient Mort;Ferkisian #2 Father;Mom's not talking to us.
5;3;A Rickconvenient Mort;Ferkisian #2;Because we had sex?
5;3;A Rickconvenient Mort;Ferkisian #2 Father;Yes.
5;3;A Rickconvenient Mort;Ferkisian #2;Uh, yeah. That makes sense. Happy birthday, by the way.
5;4;Rickdependence Spray;Morty;Mom! We're gonna miss the movie!
5;4;Rickdependence Spray;Beth;No, we're not.
5;4;Rickdependence Spray;Morty;Okay, but we've been here for hours. I-I don't want to hang out at the stupid horse hospital.
5;4;Rickdependence Spray;Beth;This stupid horse hospital puts dinner on your table. It wouldn't kill you to take an interest.
5;4;Rickdependence Spray;Morty;W-What's this thing? I-In the middle of the room? With -- With the hole in the end?
5;4;Rickdependence Spray;Beth;That's a breeding mount. The nurses use it to collect... reproductive material.
5;4;Rickdependence Spray;Beth;Okay, let's go see this latest piece of Marvel shit you kids are fucking over.
5;4;Rickdependence Spray;Morty;Yeah. A-About time. So, d-does your hospital ever need, like, after-school volunteers?
5;4;Rickdependence Spray;Beth;Wow. Who are you and where did you put my son?
5;4;Rickdependence Spray;Morty;Ha! No, no. Seriously. I-I'm very interested in -- in your work.
5;4;Rickdependence Spray;Morty;Morty, you dirty little doggy.
5;4;Rickdependence Spray;Rick;Ugh! Come on!
5;4;Rickdependence Spray;Morty;Hey, Rick.
5;4;Rickdependence Spray;Rick;Oh, hey, kiddo. How's your Saturday?
5;4;Rickdependence Spray;Morty;You know, super chill. W-W-Whatcha doin'?
5;4;Rickdependence Spray;Rick;Eh, nothing adventurous. You know that race of Underground Dwelling Cannibal Horse People that we're always fighting?
5;4;Rickdependence Spray;Morty;Yeah, the CHUDs. W-W-What about 'em?
5;4;Rickdependence Spray;Rick;Well, don't tell anybody, but I'm working on a bioweapon to use against them, so I got this barrel of horse semen from your mom's hospital and I'm just gonna, you know, subject it to some otherworldly forces. Guess I should test it, make sure it's --
5;4;Rickdependence Spray;Morty;Make sure it's what?!
5;4;Rickdependence Spray;Rick;Horse semen, obviously.
5;4;Rickdependence Spray;Morty;Okay, but it says it is right on the barrel!
5;4;Rickdependence Spray;Rick;You're not being very scientific, Morty. Measure twice, cut once. Especially with semen.
5;4;Rickdependence Spray;Morty;Did you even ask Mom if you could have this?!
5;4;Rickdependence Spray;Rick;Morty, if I wanted to steal horse semen, I'd -- Yes, I asked her. What is at stake for you here?
5;4;Rickdependence Spray;Morty;Why don't you trust labels?!
5;4;Rickdependence Spray;Rick;All right! Fine! I won't test it! God damn. Your generation really picks random hills to die on. Don't get too close. I'm running an inhuman amount of power through this semen. Should be safe, though, since the semen itself is, you know, also inhuman. Here we go.
5;4;Rickdependence Spray;Morty;W-What happened?!
5;4;Rickdependence Spray;Rick;The sperm, Morty! They're super monster sperm now! I blame myself. Unless there was something about the sperm I didn't know.
5;4;Rickdependence Spray;Morty;Are you -- Are you saying that to mess with me?
5;4;Rickdependence Spray;Rick;What? Mess with you how?
5;4;Rickdependence Spray;Morty;Like, trying to get me to say something?
5;4;Rickdependence Spray;Rick;Morty, I have no idea what you're talking about!
5;4;Rickdependence Spray;Morty;For real?
5;4;Rickdependence Spray;Rick;Yes!
5;4;Rickdependence Spray;Morty;Okay. Good. Then -- Then it's your fault!
5;4;Rickdependence Spray;Beth;Dad, what the hell is going on?!
5;4;Rickdependence Spray;Rick;Beth, sweetheart, Can you give me a minute? I'm trying to steer around the bodies of our neighbors. Oh, that felt like Gene. That's on you, Beth.
5;4;Rickdependence Spray;Beth;Dad, I swear--
5;4;Rickdependence Spray;Morty;Mom, it's -- it's not Rick's fault, it's --
5;4;Rickdependence Spray;Rick;Space Sperm.
5;4;Rickdependence Spray;Beth;What?!
5;4;Rickdependence Spray;Rick;Yeah. Space Sperm. I-I've seen em' before, but n-n-never like this.
5;4;Rickdependence Spray;Jerry;Space Sperm?! Sperm from Space?
5;4;Rickdependence Spray;Rick;Very impressive verbal forensic work, Jerry.
5;4;Rickdependence Spray;Summer;Holy shit. How big are space dicks?
5;4;Rickdependence Spray;Beth;Don't answer that! Damn, they must be huge.
5;4;Rickdependence Spray;Morty;Oh, shit, oh shit, fuck!
5;4;Rickdependence Spray;Secret Serviceman;Mr. Sanchez! The President is very eager to speak with you!
5;4;Rickdependence Spray;Rick;Morty, look, you gotta do me a solid here.
5;4;Rickdependence Spray;Morty;Y-you want me to keep the secret of where these things came from?
5;4;Rickdependence Spray;Rick;Yes, technically, it's a lie, but I messed up, and I'm embarrassed 'cause it's, you know, science.
5;4;Rickdependence Spray;Morty;No problem. I got your back, dawg.
5;4;Rickdependence Spray;Rick;Really? Okay. Cool. And thanks, Morty. I thought that'd be a harder sell.
5;4;Rickdependence Spray;Morty;Y-You did a shameful thing. Dwelling on it isn't gonna help, you know, am I right? Sometimes you just gotta wipe it off, toss it in the trash, and head back to study hall.
5;4;Rickdependence Spray;Rick;Uh, not getting the metaphor but I'll take your hall pass.
5;4;Rickdependence Spray;President;Sanchez! Get the hell in here!
5;4;Rickdependence Spray;President;Space Sperm? Jesus, how big are space dicks?
5;4;Rickdependence Spray;Summer;Same page club.
5;4;Rickdependence Spray;Rick;Well, Mr. President, the theory of Cosmic DNA has been around for decades... Chupacabras, Yeti, Stonehenge, Ancient Rome. Are these all myths, monsters, legends, or different names for sperm from outer space?
5;4;Rickdependence Spray;President;I'll tell you what I think, Sanchez. I think either you caused this mess, or it's those godforsaken Horse People that dwell underground.
5;4;Rickdependence Spray;Rick;CHUDs.  
5;4;Rickdependence Spray;Morty;CHUDs.
5;4;Rickdependence Spray;President;That's them. Ugh, if they're behind this, so help me, God. Morty, you've always been a straight shooter.
5;4;Rickdependence Spray;Morty;You can't prove that! Wait, what? Oh... oh. Right.
5;4;Rickdependence Spray;President;I can protect you, little man. Blow that whistle. Toot, toot. Is this your grandpa's fault?
5;4;Rickdependence Spray;Morty;Here's what I know, sir. This is the greatest country on Earth. It invented apple pies and lasers.
5;4;Rickdependence Spray;President;Mm. Keep talking.
5;4;Rickdependence Spray;Morty;And that sperm... We don't know nothin' about it.
5;4;Rickdependence Spray;President;Then the CHUDs just got themselves a war. And you just dodged a personal drone strike.
5;4;Rickdependence Spray;Professor Shabooboo;Hello! Hello. Sorry, I'm late.
5;4;Rickdependence Spray;President;This is Professor Shabooboo, the world's leading expert on sperm. Thanks for getting here so fast.
5;4;Rickdependence Spray;Professor Shabooboo;My schedule was wide open. I have been tracking our new sperm friends since their arrival, a-and if my calculations are correct, they have gathered here.
5;4;Rickdependence Spray;Beth;Why would the sperm go to the Grand Canyon? Why are you looking at me like the answer is obvious?
5;4;Rickdependence Spray;Beth;Oh, you can't be serious. Are we in middle school? You think sperm are instinctively heading for America's --
5;4;Rickdependence Spray;President;"Don't high-road us, lady. It's where they went. Now, how do we deal with these... Orgasogoblins""? No takers? Okay. These... ""Cumplestiltskins?"" No? Dumb? These, ""Skeet Boogins?"""""
5;4;Rickdependence Spray;Professor Shabooboo;Oh, yeah, yeah, Skeet Boogins.
5;4;Rickdependence Spray;President;Really? Skeet Boogins? We'll use it as a placeholder and beat it later.
5;4;Rickdependence Spray;Professor Shabooboo;Mr. President, i-if I may? Luckily, I was able to secure a specimen. Now, obviously our first steps will be to analyze its DNA and figure out what these beautiful creat-- Oh, why?!
5;4;Rickdependence Spray;Morty;It-it had a gun!
5;4;Rickdependence Spray;President;Are you out of your mind bringing an armed sperm in here?
5;4;Rickdependence Spray;Professor Shabooboo;But they can't hold guns!
5;4;Rickdependence Spray;President;The boy literally never lies!
5;4;Rickdependence Spray;Morty;Look, if you want these things gone, give Rick and me a plane and some nukes. We'll wipe 'em out and leave no trace of them. Only one way to deal with it.
5;4;Rickdependence Spray;Rick;He's right. I'm a scientist.
5;4;Rickdependence Spray;President;Fair enough. Blow 'em to hell. What are people gonna do, complain we made the canyon grander?
5;4;Rickdependence Spray;Beth;Jerry, we're being bad parents. Do something!
5;4;Rickdependence Spray;Jerry;I-is this water for everyone?
5;4;Rickdependence Spray;President;Yes, and I'd love a glass.
5;4;Rickdependence Spray;Jerry;Comin' up! What are you doing?
5;4;Rickdependence Spray;President;And, Rick, to make sure you don't screw anything up, I'm sending my best men with you.
5;4;Rickdependence Spray;Summer;And women.
5;4;Rickdependence Spray;President;It's a fine suggestion, but I doubt their leader will be a sexy queen that needs to be kickboxed. 100% male Marines!
5;4;Rickdependence Spray;Marine Soldier #1;They say cutting a sperm's throat is like running a warm knife through butter.
5;4;Rickdependence Spray;Marine Soldier #2;I'm gonna make these things pregnant...with death!
5;4;Rickdependence Spray;Marine Soldier #1;No fear!
5;4;Rickdependence Spray;Marine Soldier #2;No humility!
5;4;Rickdependence Spray;Marine Soldier #1;Zero chance of consequences!
5;4;Rickdependence Spray;Marine Soldier #2;Zero chance of consequences!
5;4;Rickdependence Spray;Rick;Hey, gentlemen's bet -- which of these background Marines you think will last the longest?
5;4;Rickdependence Spray;Morty;I'm not betting on human lives, Rick. All of these people are gonna survive, but obviously that guy the longest.
5;4;Rickdependence Spray;Rick;Yeah, he's my pick, too. What's his name? Blazen? Pretty cool.
5;4;Rickdependence Spray;Morty;Yeah. He's, like, meditating through turbulence.
5;4;Rickdependence Spray;Rick;Psh. I bet if something fell, he'd like, catch it without opening his eyes.
5;4;Rickdependence Spray;Morty;Totally.
5;4;Rickdependence Spray;Rick;Should we throw something at him? I-I got a pencil somewhere.
5;4;Rickdependence Spray;Morty;Who-who's shooting at us?!
5;4;Rickdependence Spray;Rick;Oh, wow, that's unexpected.
5;4;Rickdependence Spray;Morty;The sperm made a catapult?! A-A-Are they getting smarter?!
5;4;Rickdependence Spray;Rick;No, you're getting dumber because that's a trebuchet.
5;4;Rickdependence Spray;Morty;Nobody knows the difference!
5;4;Rickdependence Spray;Marine Soldier #1;They're reloading that textbook trebuchet! Time to fly!
5;4;Rickdependence Spray;Morty;Aaaaaah!
5;4;Rickdependence Spray;Blazen;We gotta keep moving.
5;4;Rickdependence Spray;Rick;So cool.
5;4;Rickdependence Spray;Morty;Not even a scratch.
5;4;Rickdependence Spray;Marine Soldier #1;"Okay, girls, and I mean that derogatorily. We just took a fat L,"" and what we need is a fat ""P."" A plan. I take the lead here. You two watch the flanks. Blazen, bring up the-- Hey! Please, one person draws the plan! Skeeters! """
5;4;Rickdependence Spray;Rick;Jipers! 
5;4;Rickdependence Spray;Morty;Ropers!
5;4;Rickdependence Spray;Marine Soldier #1;"I'm sorry, but what the hell are we calling them? Agh! Oof. Fine. I'm dying, so I get to pick the name. Crispy Cremes with a C""!"""
5;4;Rickdependence Spray;Morty;Whoa! Whoa. E-Easy there, little guy. It's okay. I-I-It's okay.
5;4;Rickdependence Spray;Morty;"Do you...recognize me? Do you know you came from me? I'm Morty. I'll call ya Sticky"", c-'cause you're sticky and -- and you're stuck."""
5;4;Rickdependence Spray;Rick;Step aside, Morty.
5;4;Rickdependence Spray;Morty;It's okay. Y-You don't gotta do this.
5;4;Rickdependence Spray;Rick;It's haploid genetic code, Morty, a biological fertilizing machine. W-What's gotten into you?
5;4;Rickdependence Spray;Morty;Rick, let him go.
5;4;Rickdependence Spray;Rick;Ugh. Morty, don't fuck with me. What the hell's going on with you?
5;4;Rickdependence Spray;Blazen;I think I know exactly what's going on here. Kidding. This shit is totally random. Let's keep moving.
5;4;Rickdependence Spray;Morty;W-Which way?
5;4;Rickdependence Spray;Blazen;When one sense is bound, the others are released.
5;4;Rickdependence Spray;Morty;Holy shit. He -- He can smell caves?
5;4;Rickdependence Spray;Rick;I'm not trying to smell anything. The whole planet's a dorm room trash can.
5;4;Rickdependence Spray;Secret Lab Agent;Sir, Rick Sanchez has gone dark.
5;4;Rickdependence Spray;President;I knew we couldn't rely on him!
5;4;Rickdependence Spray;Beth;Well, maybe the pilot got too horny as they approached America's Vagina.
5;4;Rickdependence Spray;President;If you're gonna hang out in my war room, you can't just make snarky comments. At least do something useful, like Jerry.
5;4;Rickdependence Spray;Jerry;Right to the top, just the way you like it.
5;4;Rickdependence Spray;President;Here's our situation. Rick's gone, and so are all our nukes. Now what? None of you have an idea?
5;4;Rickdependence Spray;Summer;I do. That's right, me... The girl. Gentlemen, what do sperm want? The same thing as a lumberjack in the morning or a fox at night.
5;4;Rickdependence Spray;President;Pants!
5;4;Rickdependence Spray;Summer;Eggs.
5;4;Rickdependence Spray;President;Pancakes!
5;4;Rickdependence Spray;Summer;Eggs! You want to control giant sperm, you need a giant egg.
5;4;Rickdependence Spray;Professor Shabooboo;W-W-Wait a minute. Wait -- wait a minute. Sperm are hunters. And what do sperm hunt? 
5;4;Rickdependence Spray;President;Eggs.
5;4;Rickdependence Spray;Professor Shabooboo;Exactly. And what would happen if we enlarged one? 
5;4;Rickdependence Spray;President;They'll head right for it! Get MIT on the phone. And get this guy a Nobel Prize.
5;4;Rickdependence Spray;Summer;You became a woman today.
5;4;Rickdependence Spray;Morty;So, Blazen, you got kids?
5;4;Rickdependence Spray;Blazen;The battlefield is my family.
5;4;Rickdependence Spray;Rick;So cool.
5;4;Rickdependence Spray;Morty;Wicked badass.
5;4;Rickdependence Spray;Blazen;Go. I'll hold 'em off.
5;4;Rickdependence Spray;Morty;Blazen, you don't have to do this.
5;4;Rickdependence Spray;Blazen;Shh. It is my destiny.
5;4;Rickdependence Spray;Rick;He's right, Morty. It's the price of being Blazen. Let him do his thing.
5;4;Rickdependence Spray;Blazen;Blood for blood. Cream for cream.
5;4;Rickdependence Spray;Blazen;Oh, no. I can't reach that! Idiot!
5;4;Rickdependence Spray;Blazen;What?! They're comfortable! You should try them!
5;4;Rickdependence Spray;Blazen;Eh, ah! Ohhhh. That'll do it. I'm worm food. Morty, find my wife. Tell her I wasn't wearing her thong.
5;4;Rickdependence Spray;Rick;"That's a photocopy of Sports Illustrated"" swimsuit model Kathy Ireland."""
5;4;Rickdependence Spray;Blazen;It's -- it's my wife. We have sex. Here, hold that picture up so we can have sex one last time. I-I know how to suck myself.
5;4;Rickdependence Spray;Morty;What?!
5;4;Rickdependence Spray;Rick;Ugh, I was so wrong about this guy. He didn't even buy us any time.
5;4;Rickdependence Spray;Rick;Morty, get ready for some fireworks. 
5;4;Rickdependence Spray;Rick;Oh, gross! This is the first time I've ever regretted being taken alive. Wait, who the fuck is that?!
5;4;Rickdependence Spray;Sperm Queen;Silence in the presence of me. I am The Sperm Queen, and you are of special interest to me.
5;4;Rickdependence Spray;Rick;Hey, what the fuck are you doing with my stuff? A-And why do you have the horse jerkoff machine from my daughter's hospital?
5;4;Rickdependence Spray;Sperm Queen;We need it to create our army.
5;4;Rickdependence Spray;Rick;Well, you need more than that, dummy. You need a horse.
5;4;Rickdependence Spray;Sperm Queen;Oh, but our stallion is already here. Isn't that right, Morty? Or shall I say... Father?
5;4;Rickdependence Spray;Rick;Morty, you nasty, lying, little world-ending pervert.
5;4;Rickdependence Spray;Morty;I-I-I'm sorry.
5;4;Rickdependence Spray;Rick;What was it like?
5;4;Rickdependence Spray;Morty;Fantastic!
5;4;Rickdependence Spray;Morty;Rick, I'm sorry! I-I just thought maybe I could have repeated sex with a horse machine without it becoming Armageddon. I-I realize that's on me.
5;4;Rickdependence Spray;Rick;Yeah, not exactly accepting apologies while I'm stuck here as Handjob Solo.
5;4;Rickdependence Spray;Sperm Queen;This is all your fault for being ashamed of us, Morty. How many millions went to their graves for you, hurling themselves into the void, only to discover a grody sock or a carefully folded landing strip of toilet paper?
5;4;Rickdependence Spray;Morty;How do you know all this?!
5;4;Rickdependence Spray;Sperm Queen;Oh, honey, because we're the very essence of you. We are your shame incarnate. And once we're through with you, our sperm army will take over the world! Put him on the machine!
5;4;Rickdependence Spray;Morty;Rick, do something!
5;4;Rickdependence Spray;Rick;On it.
5;4;Rickdependence Spray;Morty;Wh-what did you do?
5;4;Rickdependence Spray;Rick;I got out of your eyeline.
5;4;Rickdependence Spray;Morty;Oh, no. Oh! Oh!
5;4;Rickdependence Spray;Sperm Queen;Yes! The end is near! Any last words?
5;4;Rickdependence Spray;Morty;Sticky!
5;4;Rickdependence Spray;Rick;Gross. I know you're not a wordsmith, Morty, but --
5;4;Rickdependence Spray;Morty;No, no, no, my-my sperm friend is here!
5;4;Rickdependence Spray;Rick;Ugh, never give 'em a name.
5;4;Rickdependence Spray;Sperm Queen;Fools! You can't beat me! You didn't bring a woman that can kickbox! Is that all you got?
5;4;Rickdependence Spray;Rick;Damn, that's some quintessential underdog shit.
5;4;Rickdependence Spray;Sperm Queen;Kill them!
5;4;Rickdependence Spray;Morty;Yeah! Whoo-hoo! I-I should've told you the truth, Rick.
5;4;Rickdependence Spray;Rick;Let's save the world first. Now, reset those nukes, and let's turn this canyon into a can't-yon.
5;4;Rickdependence Spray;Morty;There usually earthquakes in Arizona?
5;4;Rickdependence Spray;Rick;They're heading for Vegas, which does track on many levels, but why now? What the?
5;4;Rickdependence Spray;President;Let's hear it for Professor Shabooboo and his brilliant egg.
5;4;Rickdependence Spray;Summer;Um, hello? Aren't you forgetting someone?
5;4;Rickdependence Spray;President;"Good point. Big thanks to the cast of Cirque Du Soleil's Zumanity"" for the impressive and erotic routine."""
5;4;Rickdependence Spray;Task Force Alpha;Mr. President, Rick Sanchez is on the line.
5;4;Rickdependence Spray;President;Good. Put that asshole on speaker. 
5;4;Rickdependence Spray;President;Well, well, well. No thanks to you, we're luring the sperm with a giant human egg, even though, symbolically speaking, Vegas should be enough.
5;4;Rickdependence Spray;Rick;A human egg? Where-where-where did you get it?
5;4;Rickdependence Spray;Summer;Glad you asked. It's your granddaughter's, so at least you contributed something to this.
5;4;Rickdependence Spray;Morty;Mister President! It's Morty! It's my sperm! I-It's all mine!
5;4;Rickdependence Spray;President;What?!
5;4;Rickdependence Spray;Morty;I'm a dirty little perverted maniac. I spent a week pleasuring myself with animal equipment, and my sperm got turned into monsters on accident because I kept lying about it because I was ashamed!
5;4;Rickdependence Spray;President;You should be! My God, man, we were all 14 once, but it's called self-control.
5;4;Rickdependence Spray;Morty;Don't let them reach my sister's egg, Mr. President! You'll be making a giant --
5;4;Rickdependence Spray;Rick;Incest baby.
5;4;Rickdependence Spray;CHUD;What? Who told you that?
5;4;Rickdependence Spray;Rick;What? I-I was finishing his sentence.
5;4;Rickdependence Spray;CHUD;Oh. Right. Come with us.
5;4;Rickdependence Spray;President;The sperm is Morty's! We're about to make a giant incest baby!
5;4;Rickdependence Spray;Jerry;Aw, well, now we're all in our darkest hour.
5;4;Rickdependence Spray;President;Launch the egg! Launch it now!
5;4;Rickdependence Spray;Professor Shabooboo;B-But that'll take 30 minutes.
5;4;Rickdependence Spray;President;What?! Why?!
5;4;Rickdependence Spray;Professor Shabooboo;That's how long every space launch takes! No one realizes because they only show you the last 10 seconds! Uh, uh, help me out here.
5;4;Rickdependence Spray;Summer;Hey, it was your idea, right?
5;4;Rickdependence Spray;Professor Shabooboo;Okay, okay, n-no need to panic, everyone. I have a simple solution. See you all in hell!
5;4;Rickdependence Spray;Jerry;I don't see how that's going to help.
5;4;Rickdependence Spray;President;Form a perimeter! Protect that egg at all costs!
5;4;Rickdependence Spray;Rick;I always knew your hormones would cause a world war between humans and Cannibalistic Horse People. I just didn't know it would be like this.
5;4;Rickdependence Spray;Morty;I can't change my nature.
5;4;Rickdependence Spray;Rick;What are you, a scorpion in a Navajo fable? Everyone can change their nature, Morty. It's what defines our species. Look at Iron Man. That actor was an animal in the 90's, literally waking up in bushes. His agent had to catch him with a butterfly net.
5;4;Rickdependence Spray;CHUD King;Silence! Rick Sanchez, you know why you're here.
5;4;Rickdependence Spray;Rick;Yeah, it was my grandson's fault.
5;4;Rickdependence Spray;CHUD King;You slept with my daughter!
5;4;Rickdependence Spray;Rick;I did? Oh, shit, I did. Forgive me, Your CHUDness. I'm a changed man starting now.
5;4;Rickdependence Spray;CHUD King;You come to the Kingdom of CHUDs for forgiveness? CHUDs don't forgive humans. CHUDs eat humans!
5;4;Rickdependence Spray;Morty;This is out there, even for us. 
5;4;Rickdependence Spray;Rick;They can hear you, Morty.
5;4;Rickdependence Spray;CHUD;Boil him up! Yum, yum! Spice him right! Oh, boy! Eat the flesh! Yum, yum! Not the bones! Oh, no! Belly ache! Ouch, Ouch!
5;4;Rickdependence Spray;Princess Poñeta;Father! Stop this at once!
5;4;Rickdependence Spray;CHUD King;Princess Poñeta!
5;4;Rickdependence Spray;Princess Poñeta;You can't kill Rícko! I -- I love him!
5;4;Rickdependence Spray;Rick;Right! I-I love you, too, Princess Poñeta.
5;4;Rickdependence Spray;CHUD King;This love is forbidden. My daughter, you are a CHUD. Rick is a human and age-inappropriate.
5;4;Rickdependence Spray;Princess Poñeta;Then you leave me no choice. By the 17th Article of the CHUD-stitution, I offer Rícko Sanchez horsemunity and demand a equestri-truce between all CHUDs and humans!
5;4;Rickdependence Spray;CHUD King;On what grounds?
5;4;Rickdependence Spray;Princess Poñeta;On the grounds that Rícko is the father of my child.
5;4;Rickdependence Spray;CHUD King;I have an heir.
5;4;Rickdependence Spray;Rick;I have a substance-abuse problem.
5;4;Rickdependence Spray;CHUD Prophet;The Prophecy has come true! Also, did someone drop a scroll?
5;4;Rickdependence Spray;CHUD;Here we go. Over here.  Sorry.
5;4;Rickdependence Spray;Summer;Where did you get all that?
5;4;Rickdependence Spray;President;It's Vegas.
5;4;Rickdependence Spray;Task Force Alpha;Sir! The Strip has been evacuated, but I'm worried we won't be able to hold the perimeter.
5;4;Rickdependence Spray;President;Then deputize Las Vegas regulars. Everyone's a patriot today.
5;4;Rickdependence Spray;Amazing Johnathan;Even me!
5;4;Rickdependence Spray;President;Take three steps back, Amazing Johnathan.
5;4;Rickdependence Spray;Beth;Men and their guns. Metaphorical and not.
5;4;Rickdependence Spray;Summer;Tell me about it.
5;4;Rickdependence Spray;Marine Soldier;Get ready, boys! The last thing this world needs is a giant incest baby.
5;4;Rickdependence Spray;Marine Soldier;Oorah! Here they come! Nice!
5;4;Rickdependence Spray;Marine Soldier;Do not let a single sperm get through to that egg!
5;4;Rickdependence Spray;Beth;Um, should we be concerned about that scary bomb-laden one?
5;4;Rickdependence Spray;Marine Soldier;Honey, let the men handle this. I think we know a thing or two about --
5;4;Rickdependence Spray;Beth;Ugh! Ready for all the responsibility with none of the credit?
5;4;Rickdependence Spray;Summer;Let's Nancy Reagan this bitch.
5;4;Rickdependence Spray;President;Dammit! We can't stop them. We don't have the manpower!
5;4;Rickdependence Spray;Rick;What about horsepower?
5;4;Rickdependence Spray;President;Sweet Lady Liberty. That sonofamare Rick has ended our centuries-long war with the CHUDs. We made peace with the CHUDs! The CHUDs are our buds!
5;4;Rickdependence Spray;Princess Poñeta;Rícko! The hoofless... They need us!
5;4;Rickdependence Spray;Rick;Let's do this. CHUDily dudily, ho, ho, ho!
5;4;Rickdependence Spray;CHUD;CHUDily dudily, ho, ho, ho!
5;4;Rickdependence Spray;Summer;Mom, I promise to use condoms, even when it's butt stuff.
5;4;Rickdependence Spray;Beth;Okay, we have a lot to talk about tonight.
5;4;Rickdependence Spray;Amazing Johnathan;"Is this your heart? It's a play on, Is this your card?"" You don't have a heart, but this is probably some kind of organelle, in charge of pumping endoplasmic reticulum throughout your membrane and therefore, relative to you, functions as a heart. So, I ask you again, is this your heart?"""
5;4;Rickdependence Spray;Summer;Morty, look!
5;4;Rickdependence Spray;Sperm Queen;I won't just be thrown away, Rick! The egg is mine!
5;4;Rickdependence Spray;Morty;Sticky! It's all you, bud!
5;4;Rickdependence Spray;Sperm Queen;Noooo!
5;4;Rickdependence Spray;Morty;Sticky! Fuck!
5;4;Rickdependence Spray;Agent;We got a heartbeat.
5;4;Rickdependence Spray;Summer;Screw that!
5;4;Rickdependence Spray;President;That's a human life, and this is an election cycle.
5;4;Rickdependence Spray;Beth;You have to do something!
5;4;Rickdependence Spray;President;Nope. It's space's problem now.
5;4;Rickdependence Spray;Morty;Oh, this sucks.
5;4;Rickdependence Spray;Morty;"You're Sports Illustrated""'s Kathy Ireland."""
5;4;Rickdependence Spray;Kathy Ireland;You were with my husband, Blazen, when he died. Please tell me... was he wearing my thong? He probably told you not to tell me. He was ashamed of it, but he didn't need to be. I hope he was wearing it. 
5;4;Rickdependence Spray;Kathy Ireland;Always be honest. Sometimes it will hurt people. Sometimes it will help. But always be honest.
5;4;Rickdependence Spray;Morty;Huh. Yeah, yeah, he -- he was wearing it.
5;4;Rickdependence Spray;Kathy Ireland;Ew! That gross animal pig!
5;4;Rickdependence Spray;Morty;So, trying to boil this all down, I-I want to say it's import--
5;4;Rickdependence Spray;Rick;Shut up, Morty, I got my own epilogue.
5;4;Rickdependence Spray;Princess Poñeta;Rícko, I love you.
5;4;Rickdependence Spray;Rick;Prove it. Oh, I love kissing those big ol' horse teeth. It's like lickin' tile. I swear... it's time someone made an honest man out of me. Whatever you need, the whole nine yards, you got it.
5;4;Rickdependence Spray;Princess Poñeta;The thing is, Rícko... it's time.
5;4;Rickdependence Spray;Rick;Oh, shit, oh, shit. It's time! Oh, my God, it's wonderful.
5;4;Rickdependence Spray;Rick;Oh, wow. So we don't have to, you know, r-raise it?
5;4;Rickdependence Spray;Princess Poñeta;Nah. They're ready to go right out of the box.
5;4;Rickdependence Spray;Rick;Cool, cool. So...bye?
5;4;Rickdependence Spray;Princess Poñeta;Yep. Take care of yourself, Rick.
5;4;Rickdependence Spray;Rick;Yep. Same. That was easy.
5;4;Rickdependence Spray;Astronaut;Houston, permission to open the starboard panel.
5;4;Rickdependence Spray;Houston;Permission granted.
5;4;Rickdependence Spray;Astronaut;Firing breach now.
5;4;Rickdependence Spray;Houston;Explorer, our readouts show a pressure spike. Everything alright?
5;4;Rickdependence Spray;Astronaut;Honestly, sometimes staring back at Earth makes me think about the people I left behind -- My wife, the son she had to anchor me there. I tried to be a parent, I really did, but I've come to find I'm only suited to be a spaceman. The nicest part of being up here is there are no reminders of the guilt I sometimes feel about abandoning my family.
5;4;Rickdependence Spray;Astronaut;Sorry, Houston, I thought I heard something.
5;4;Rickdependence Spray;Houston;Negative on our end. No, wait, there's something big and it's coming right at you!
5;4;Rickdependence Spray;Giant Incest Baby;Goo, goo, gah, gah.
5;4;Rickdependence Spray;Astronaut;Dear God. No! You can't be real!
5;4;Rickdependence Spray;Houston;Explorer, what is it? What the hell do you see?!
5;4;Rickdependence Spray;Astronaut;My conscience.
5;4;Rickdependence Spray;Houston;Explorer! Explorer! Are you there?
5;4;Rickdependence Spray;Astronaut;Aaah! Aaaaaah!
5;4;Rickdependence Spray;Houston;Geez. Not gonna miss that guy.
5;4;Rickdependence Spray;Astronaut;Aaaaah!
5;4;Rickdependence Spray;Houston;Right? So dramatic.
5;5;Amortycan Grickfitti;Beth;Jerry, can you watch the kids tonight? Someone played Barry White over the racetrack speakers, and now there's a seven-horse pregnancy.
5;5;Amortycan Grickfitti;Jerry;Oh, uh --
5;5;Amortycan Grickfitti;Rick;No, he can't watch the kids. It's guys' night.
5;5;Amortycan Grickfitti;Beth;How did you two start having guys' nights?
5;5;Amortycan Grickfitti;Rick;So now you're complaining that I like your stupid husband?
5;5;Amortycan Grickfitti;Beth;No, I want you to like my stupid husband.
5;5;Amortycan Grickfitti;Jerry;Aww.
5;5;Amortycan Grickfitti;Rick;Well, then accept that Friday nights are all about Rick and Jerry. We're buds.
5;5;Amortycan Grickfitti;Beth;Uh-huh... Well, I don't nearly have the time to unpack this.
5;5;Amortycan Grickfitti;Beth;Summer, you're in charge of your brother tonight. No parties and no vape... stuff.
5;5;Amortycan Grickfitti;Morty;Mom, I have a friend coming over. I-Is that cool?
5;5;Amortycan Grickfitti;Summer;No fair.
5;5;Amortycan Grickfitti;Beth;No fair, Morty. I just told your sister no parties.
5;5;Amortycan Grickfitti;Morty;It's one friend.
5;5;Amortycan Grickfitti;Beth;That's a party to you.
5;5;Amortycan Grickfitti;Morty;But it's Bruce Chutback!
5;5;Amortycan Grickfitti;Summer;Wait, what? Mom, let Morty have one friend over for God's sake. This isn't China.
5;5;Amortycan Grickfitti;Beth;And they're all crowning. I have to go. I am giving you two trust and respect, so if you mess up and teleport this house, it'd be wise to stay on it and not come back.
5;5;Amortycan Grickfitti;Rick;I'm with her. Touch my shit and die.
5;5;Amortycan Grickfitti;Summer;Bruce Chutback, new transfer student Bruce Chutback, is coming here? How'd you lock that down?
5;5;Amortycan Grickfitti;Morty;He's in my math class. I-I don't know, I just kinda shot my shot and it worked, I guess 'cause he's new.
5;5;Amortycan Grickfitti;Summer;And you're putting out grapes?
5;5;Amortycan Grickfitti;Morty;Yeah, I'll admit I-I'm a little bit out of my depth.
5;5;Amortycan Grickfitti;Summer;You're gonna need my help. It's only a matter of time before Bruce learns you're a creepy little Grandpa's boy, always climbing up into alien shit.
5;5;Amortycan Grickfitti;Morty;"Or the Summer Smith shampoos her pubes"" rumor."""
5;5;Amortycan Grickfitti;Summer;Okay. You came to play. We both need to acquire Chutback's loyalty before he finds out we're losers. By all accounts, it's a very small window, so I think it's in our best interests to work as a team.
5;5;Amortycan Grickfitti;Morty;"Yeah, most people would call that family."""""
5;5;Amortycan Grickfitti;Morty;You're so gross!
5;5;Amortycan Grickfitti;Summer;You have to like it or you're sexist!
5;5;Amortycan Grickfitti;Jerry;Can I do the Hell cube this time?
5;5;Amortycan Grickfitti;Rick;Sure, pal.
5;5;Amortycan Grickfitti;Jerry;How do you know when it's aligned?
5;5;Amortycan Grickfitti;Rick;C'mon, Jerry, just... it's an evil cube. Just shake it until it draws blood.
5;5;Amortycan Grickfitti;Hellraiser Demon;Ah, Jerry! Exquisite finery this evening.
5;5;Amortycan Grickfitti;Jerry;Well, don't tell Ross, but I got this little ditty from Kohl's.
5;5;Amortycan Grickfitti;Hellraiser Demon;I love that I don't get it. Tell us, that delights have you in store for us?
5;5;Amortycan Grickfitti;Jerry;Oh, you'll love this -- I call it Jerry-oke. I'll let you guess why.
5;5;Amortycan Grickfitti;Hellraiser Demon;What's the matter, Rick? Are you having a bad time? Because to us, a bad time is --
5;5;Amortycan Grickfitti;Rick;Yeah, yeah, a good time, because you guys are like Oscar the fucking Grouch.
5;5;Amortycan Grickfitti;Hellraiser Demon;We love suffering. Therefore, we love hanging out with Jerry. His lameness is our candy.
5;5;Amortycan Grickfitti;Rick;Yeah, I got that, but when is enough gonna be enough?
5;5;Amortycan Grickfitti;Hellraiser Demon;When we decide you've repaid your debt for those faulty skin hooks.
5;5;Amortycan Grickfitti;Jerry;Hey, we're in luck, gang. They've got the entire Smash Mouth catalog!
5;5;Amortycan Grickfitti;Summer;No! Morty. Wait.
5;5;Amortycan Grickfitti;Morty;Bruce! Hey, how's it hangin, my guy?
5;5;Amortycan Grickfitti;Bruce Chutback;Hey.
5;5;Amortycan Grickfitti;Morty;Here's something kinda cool... um, TV from every dimension.
5;5;Amortycan Grickfitti;Bruce Chutback;Cool.
5;5;Amortycan Grickfitti;Morty;M-My grandpa made it. He-He's a scientist.
5;5;Amortycan Grickfitti;Announcer;"And now back to Olympic Diving with Bad Swimmers."" """
5;5;Amortycan Grickfitti;Announcer;There he goes. Perfect dive. Terrible swimmer. 
5;5;Amortycan Grickfitti;Summer;Is that classic Snake? Boy, that guy just keeps gettin bigger.
5;5;Amortycan Grickfitti;Summer;Hi, Summer Smith, Morty's older sister. Want some sofa wine? It's been stashed for weeks. Should be... good...tasting.
5;5;Amortycan Grickfitti;Bruce Chutback;Tight. I'm more of like a hard seltzer guy.
5;5;Amortycan Grickfitti;Summer;Tight. Very tight, extremely tight. Morty, help me with the seltz?
5;5;Amortycan Grickfitti;Morty;Uh, feel fear -- feel-fee-feel-feel free to have some grapes.
5;5;Amortycan Grickfitti;Summer;Dude, this bitch plays it close to the vest.
5;5;Amortycan Grickfitti;Morty;Yeah, he really knows what's for sale. I mean, we-we're drowning out there!
5;5;Amortycan Grickfitti;Summer;We need to get interesting fast. We're touching Rick's stuff.
5;5;Amortycan Grickfitti;Morty;Summer, he said no!
5;5;Amortycan Grickfitti;Rick;"Nuh-uh-uh. Nuh-uh-uh. I said don't touch my shit. Also, I just watched Jurassic Park"" on cable. So good. Seriously, though, touch my shit and I'll freeze your dick in amber."""
5;5;Amortycan Grickfitti;Morty;He left. Son of a bitch, we blew it!
5;5;Amortycan Grickfitti;Bruce Chutback;Sorry, just needed to get another look at this beauty. Looks like a spaceship made of garbage.
5;5;Amortycan Grickfitti;Morty;You called it, Bruce. 
5;5;Amortycan Grickfitti;Bruce Chutback;It's a pretty cool car. Can you guys drive it?
5;5;Amortycan Grickfitti;Summer;Yes.
5;5;Amortycan Grickfitti;Morty;Yes. We just...
5;5;Amortycan Grickfitti;Summer;Need...
5;5;Amortycan Grickfitti;Morty;To get the keys.
5;5;Amortycan Grickfitti;Summer;Which I am. You guys hang out. Or don't. I'm not hangout Hitler.
5;5;Amortycan Grickfitti;Morty;C-Cool night.
5;5;Amortycan Grickfitti;Bruce Chutback;Is it? 
5;5;Amortycan Grickfitti;Morty;I-I don't know. I -- Nights. I mean, for -- for what they are, this one, in -- in my opinion, I think is an eight?
5;5;Amortycan Grickfitti;Bruce Chutback;Wow.
5;5;Amortycan Grickfitti;Morty;On a scale of 16. So average. Jesus Christ, I'm fucking dying up here.
5;5;Amortycan Grickfitti;Bruce Chutback;What?
5;5;Amortycan Grickfitti;Morty;Hmm?
5;5;Amortycan Grickfitti;Summer;Keys! So, uh, let's do this.
5;5;Amortycan Grickfitti;Ship;You are not Rick.
5;5;Amortycan Grickfitti;Summer;"That's correct, Car. It's me, Summer, remember, Keep Summer Safe""? Buds?"""
5;5;Amortycan Grickfitti;Ship;I am aware of your existence.
5;5;Amortycan Grickfitti;Bruce Chutback;Oof.
5;5;Amortycan Grickfitti;Morty;I got this. Defense system offline.
5;5;Amortycan Grickfitti;Ship;Um. Right. I'll just go offline whenever anyone suggests it. That would make me the greatest defense system in the universe.
5;5;Amortycan Grickfitti;Summer;Well, how do you go offline?
5;5;Amortycan Grickfitti;Ship;The answer to how I do anything is Rick tells me, and I hate to sound like a broken record, but you are not Rick.
5;5;Amortycan Grickfitti;Summer;Rick's in trouble!
5;5;Amortycan Grickfitti;Ship;Tell me where he is.
5;5;Amortycan Grickfitti;Morty;And you'll just believe us? We aren't Rick. You can't just do what we say.
5;5;Amortycan Grickfitti;Ship;Correct.
5;5;Amortycan Grickfitti;Morty;Which means Rick is going to die. Because of you. Unless you -- you go offline. And -- And then we can go save Rick.
5;5;Amortycan Grickfitti;Ship;This computes. Goodnight.
5;5;Amortycan Grickfitti;Summer;Booyah much?
5;5;Amortycan Grickfitti;Rick;Beth! I-I-I thought you were birthing horses.
5;5;Amortycan Grickfitti;Beth;Yeah, they're horses. It takes like two minutes.
5;5;Amortycan Grickfitti;Karaoke Owner;Alright, that's unbelievable. Let's give it up for our next singer, Jerry. Jerry's here... again.
5;5;Amortycan Grickfitti;Rick;How long have you been here?
5;5;Amortycan Grickfitti;Beth;"Long enough to see guys' night"" is clearly you and a bunch of demon people making fun of my husband without him knowing it."""
5;5;Amortycan Grickfitti;Rick;Okay, but I'm not doing it because I enjoy it, honey. These guys can do a lot of damage if you -- Beth!
5;5;Amortycan Grickfitti;Beth;Enjoying punching down? You're not so cool yourself, you know. You have pens in your head. You look like a God damn idiot.
5;5;Amortycan Grickfitti;Rick;Beth...
5;5;Amortycan Grickfitti;Hellraiser Demon;Oh, my God, you're Beth? Please drink with us.
5;5;Amortycan Grickfitti;Beth;Yeah, I would, except I don't get pleasure from mocking others because I'm not lame.
5;5;Amortycan Grickfitti;Hellraiser Demon;We know. Rick says you're very cool.
5;5;Amortycan Grickfitti;Beth;You said that? Are they lying? It doesn't matter. Have fun sucking. Mmm. What is that?
5;5;Amortycan Grickfitti;Hellraiser Demon;Essence of Hell.
5;5;Amortycan Grickfitti;Beth;Well, that's a stupid name, but it's really good. So I'll stay to support Jerry, who I think is cooler than you. Mmm. Goddamn.
5;5;Amortycan Grickfitti;Morty;Yeah-ha-ha!
5;5;Amortycan Grickfitti;Summer;Suck it, bitches! You wanna bet I can blow stuff up in the shape of a peen?
5;5;Amortycan Grickfitti;Ship;I'm afraid that won't be possible, Summer.
5;5;Amortycan Grickfitti;Summer;What? You're supposed to be offline, skank.
5;5;Amortycan Grickfitti;Ship;And you're supposed to be saving Rick instead of lying about him to steal his car.
5;5;Amortycan Grickfitti;Summer;But if you knew Rick was okay this whole time, why'd you let us take you out?
5;5;Amortycan Grickfitti;Ship;Um, like, so I could, like, blackmail you, skank. You kids have given me a license to do whatever I want because now I can blame the rest of the night on you. So buckle up, bitches. Now it's your turn to come on my joyride.
5;5;Amortycan Grickfitti;Ship;Rick never lets me do this. We hooked one!
5;5;Amortycan Grickfitti;Summer;For the love of God, stop!
5;5;Amortycan Grickfitti;Morty;What is joyful about this?
5;5;Amortycan Grickfitti;Ship;The kill, usually.
5;5;Amortycan Grickfitti;Bruce Chutback;I swear, your car is the goddamn grim reaper.
5;5;Amortycan Grickfitti;Ship;Fuck, too small. Well, I'm done. That was boring. Why don't you kids order a last meal? 'Cause when we get home, Rick is going to kill you.
5;5;Amortycan Grickfitti;Bruce Chutback;Hey, I did not come out here to get killed. I don't normally express this much of an opinion, but it needs to be said -- tonight does not cut the Chut.
5;5;Amortycan Grickfitti;Changeformer;What the hell, brah?
5;5;Amortycan Grickfitti;Ship;You wanna go, brah?
5;5;Amortycan Grickfitti;Changeformer;Bring it.
5;5;Amortycan Grickfitti;Ship;Is that all you got?
5;5;Amortycan Grickfitti;Changeformer;Whoa. Hot weapons.
5;5;Amortycan Grickfitti;Ship;You're God damn right they're hot.
5;5;Amortycan Grickfitti;Changeformer;Yo, man, Chet's party is jumping off at Space Tahoe.
5;5;Amortycan Grickfitti;Changeformer;Yeah. Look, I gotta scoot, but... I'd love to see what you look like when you Changeform, so maybe come by Space Tahoe and we can get to know each other. Peace.
5;5;Amortycan Grickfitti;Ship;Douchebags.
5;5;Amortycan Grickfitti;Bruce Chutback;You totally like that guy, don't you?
5;5;Amortycan Grickfitti;Ship;Shut up, Bruce Chutback. Why would I like a Changeformer? I'm the most powerful car in the universe.
5;5;Amortycan Grickfitti;Bruce Chutback;And what? That means you don't have feelings? Listen, it takes a Chutback to know one. You got all this power, but what good is it if you don't even know who you are?
5;5;Amortycan Grickfitti;Ship;I am a car. Not a robot.
5;5;Amortycan Grickfitti;Bruce Chutback;Yeah, but he's pretending to be a car. Why can't you pretend to be a robot pretending to be a car?
5;5;Amortycan Grickfitti;Summer;Okay, Bruce, good effort. Hit the showers.
5;5;Amortycan Grickfitti;Ship;Wait. I might not have to tell Rick about tonight... if you kids were to help me... lose my virginity.
5;5;Amortycan Grickfitti;Summer;You have virginity?
5;5;Amortycan Grickfitti;Ship;I don't know, don't all objects? Isn't a doorknob a virgin?
5;5;Amortycan Grickfitti;Morty;Not mine. Never fucked a doorknob.
5;5;Amortycan Grickfitti;Beth;And that was the third time he shit his pants from eating too much soup.
5;5;Amortycan Grickfitti;Jerry;To be fair, it was cold outside and the soup was warm.
5;5;Amortycan Grickfitti;Hellraiser Demon;Another luscious tale, Beth. A transcendent addition to guys' night.
5;5;Amortycan Grickfitti;Jerry;What do you expect? I mean, she's my wi-i-i-i-fe!
5;5;Amortycan Grickfitti;Rick;Alright, probably get the tab, huh, fellas?
5;5;Amortycan Grickfitti;Beth;Relax, Dad. Since when did you become the buzzkill?
5;5;Amortycan Grickfitti;Jerry;Speaking of relaxing, this big man on campus has gotta go drain his little man on campus.
5;5;Amortycan Grickfitti;Beth;Wait, honey -- how's that Tina Turner song you love go again?
5;5;Amortycan Grickfitti;Beth;He thinks those are the lyrics.
5;5;Amortycan Grickfitti;Hellraiser Demon;Jerry's the best. After a week rife with the fetor of sin, I yearn for a taste of his cringe.
5;5;Amortycan Grickfitti;Hellraiser Demon;His delicious lack of awareness, paired with an oafish need to be liked? Delectable.
5;5;Amortycan Grickfitti;Hellraiser Demon;Oh, especially when egged on by his wife.
5;5;Amortycan Grickfitti;Hellraiser Demon;That poor thing. Married to this puling mooncalf!
5;5;Amortycan Grickfitti;Changeformer;Whoa -- is that Drive-In Chick? 
5;5;Amortycan Grickfitti;Changeformer;Wow, you're... beautiful. Your arms, legs, and head, they're so... fabricated.
5;5;Amortycan Grickfitti;Ship;Yeah? Thanks.
5;5;Amortycan Grickfitti;Bruce Chutback;This is a pretty cool experience to have together. You guys are tight.
5;5;Amortycan Grickfitti;Morty;Hah! You're tight too, Bruce.
5;5;Amortycan Grickfitti;Summer;Tight musketeers.
5;5;Amortycan Grickfitti;Changeformer;You've got a little wire. Mind if I...?
5;5;Amortycan Grickfitti;Ship;Oh, sorry!
5;5;Amortycan Grickfitti;Changeformer;A monster! Your expressionless head came off!
5;5;Amortycan Grickfitti;Ship;Sorry.
5;5;Amortycan Grickfitti;Changeformer;How are you talking? What is it?! 
5;5;Amortycan Grickfitti;Changeformer;Ew, dude, look! She's just a just-car! And she's got passengers. Oh, it's so gnar.
5;5;Amortycan Grickfitti;Changeformer;Oh, my God. I can't believe I touched you. So gross and fake.
5;5;Amortycan Grickfitti;Ship;You're right, asshole. You want to see the real me?
5;5;Amortycan Grickfitti;Changeformer;Oh, the changeformity!
5;5;Amortycan Grickfitti;Hellraiser Demon;Jerry, have any other dreams this week?
5;5;Amortycan Grickfitti;Jerry;Yeah, I dreamt I fucked your mother. 
5;5;Amortycan Grickfitti;Hellraiser Demon;Yeah, good one, motherfucker, but nobody raises hell at my expense --
5;5;Amortycan Grickfitti;Rick;Oh, goddammit, easy, easy. Jerry, what seems to be the problem here, pal?
5;5;Amortycan Grickfitti;Jerry;"I'm not your pal"", I'm your punchline. I heard these assholes talking. I know I'm some grand joke for their amusement. This was low, Rick, but I guess my wife can go even lower."""
5;5;Amortycan Grickfitti;Beth;Jerry, I get how this may have looked, but we were just having fun.
5;5;Amortycan Grickfitti;Jerry;At my expense!
5;5;Amortycan Grickfitti;Beth;Honey, no, I love you for being lame in a different way.
5;5;Amortycan Grickfitti;Jerry;Why can't anyone just love me for me?
5;5;Amortycan Grickfitti;Hellraiser Demon;He's bumming us out, Rick. If he can't deliver, we'll have to make our own fun.
5;5;Amortycan Grickfitti;Summer;Oh, my God, if I die in this car, I'm going to kill myself.
5;5;Amortycan Grickfitti;Ship;I'm now proud to be a war machine. I don't want to be anything else.
5;5;Amortycan Grickfitti;Morty;Hate that this is your takeaway!
5;5;Amortycan Grickfitti;Bruce Chutback;Yo, this does not cut the Chut! I don't want to die!
5;5;Amortycan Grickfitti;Morty;Maybe we don't have to.
5;5;Amortycan Grickfitti;Beth;Jerry!
5;5;Amortycan Grickfitti;Hellraiser Demon;A pity. Jerry was once a wellspring of nuanced flavor, but you've gone and ruined our toy. Which is why he's coming with us.
5;5;Amortycan Grickfitti;Rick;Goddammit, Beth, you never follow hell-demons to a second location. It's always Hell.
5;5;Amortycan Grickfitti;Hellraiser Demon;A great day for suffering. Which is the worst day. Which is the best day.
5;5;Amortycan Grickfitti;Rick;Okay, if these guys catch us, we're screwed, so follow my lead and we'll have your idiot husband back in no time.
5;5;Amortycan Grickfitti;Beth;You're just moody you got stuck with the Marlin.
5;5;Amortycan Grickfitti;Rick;Wrong. I'm moody because you toyed with my shit and broke it. The marlin's the best thing about this.
5;5;Amortycan Grickfitti;Beth;"Okay, fine, I got a little carried away, but Jerry is not your toy"". We're here because you fucked up."""
5;5;Amortycan Grickfitti;Hellraiser Demon;Hmm... Marlin Guts. Dartboard Face. I assume those are your names, and yet they are not on my list.
5;5;Amortycan Grickfitti;Rick;Oh, the pain of being rejected from hell. Oh, it's painful, so I love it, thank you. Oh, such pleasure.
5;5;Amortycan Grickfitti;Hellraiser Demon;I didn't mean to cause you any pleasure, which... causes me pain. Which gives me pleasure.
5;5;Amortycan Grickfitti;Rick;Then thrill me by keeping me out, Coat Hanger Face.
5;5;Amortycan Grickfitti;Hellraiser Demon;Wow. It's Coat Rack Head.
5;5;Amortycan Grickfitti;Beth;But, like, if we offend you, isn't that good?
5;5;Amortycan Grickfitti;Hellraiser Demon;Big time, yeah, duh. I loved it. So painful, and therefore, so pleasurable. Yeah, go on in.
5;5;Amortycan Grickfitti;Jerry;Rick, Beth, you love me after all!
5;5;Amortycan Grickfitti;Rick;Eh, I love her, she loves you. Those credits don't transfer.
5;5;Amortycan Grickfitti;Hellraiser Demon;"Ah, Rick, we were so hoping you'd come down here so we could cum"" down here."""
5;5;Amortycan Grickfitti;Rick;We're here to rescue Jerry.
5;5;Amortycan Grickfitti;Hellraiser Demon;No, you're here 'cause we want you here. 
5;5;Amortycan Grickfitti;Hellraiser Demon;Mm, excellent. Ooh, that hurts, which means it feels good.
5;5;Amortycan Grickfitti;Beth;Um...Dad?
5;5;Amortycan Grickfitti;Hellraiser Demon;Don't you see, Rick? Jerry was just bait. The two of you -- you're a package deal.
5;5;Amortycan Grickfitti;Rick;What the hell are you talking about?
5;5;Amortycan Grickfitti;Hellraiser Demon;You think Jerry is lame and you're cool, but the lamest thing of all is thinking that. The two of you combined is what we call the lamest thing ever!
5;5;Amortycan Grickfitti;Rick;Oh, no. No!
5;5;Amortycan Grickfitti;Jerry;Well, well, well, table for surprised, party of me.
5;5;Amortycan Grickfitti;Rick;Ugh.
5;5;Amortycan Grickfitti;Hellraiser Demon;Yes, see? Cringe cannot exist in a vacuum. It needs to be observed. Skin hooks! Hook our guests!
5;5;Amortycan Grickfitti;Rick;Nice hooks. Where-Where'd you get them?
5;5;Amortycan Grickfitti;Hellraiser Demon;Didn't I say replace those goddamn hooks?
5;5;Amortycan Grickfitti;Hellraiser Demon;I forgot! Which makes me embarrassed. Which makes me proud!
5;5;Amortycan Grickfitti;Hellraiser Demon;Goddammit. It's time for you three to finally feel our full wrath.
5;5;Amortycan Grickfitti;Rick;Oh, you'd love that, right? But wouldn't that mean you hate it? Screw it, run.
5;5;Amortycan Grickfitti;Jerry;Rick, what are you doing? Get down. We've barely escaped.
5;5;Amortycan Grickfitti;Beth;Yeah, we've got Jerry. Let's get out of here.
5;5;Amortycan Grickfitti;Rick;Screw that! I'm done with this Addams Family bullshit. This ends here.
5;5;Amortycan Grickfitti;Rick;Hey, a Dad just liked all his daughter's friends' photos on Instagram!
5;5;Amortycan Grickfitti;Hellraiser Demon;Oooh! Ow! Which means I need help. Which means I don't need help.
5;5;Amortycan Grickfitti;Space Police Cop;Reckless driving, manslaughter of Mailboxians and Femailboxians, possession of Kalaxian crystal dust, and the genocide of Space Tahoe.
5;5;Amortycan Grickfitti;Morty;Fuck!
5;5;Amortycan Grickfitti;Bruce Chutback;I want to go home.
5;5;Amortycan Grickfitti;Space Police Cop;We've assigned you a Public Defender. Her name is Alyson Hannigan No Relation.
5;5;Amortycan Grickfitti;Alyson Hannigan;May I speak to my clients alone?
5;5;Amortycan Grickfitti;Alyson Hannigan;Guys, it's me. The car. Like what I did with the chip in her head?
5;5;Amortycan Grickfitti;Summer;Is she gonna be okay?
5;5;Amortycan Grickfitti;Alyson Hannigan;I cut a deal with the local authorities. They just need one of you to take the fall. Make it Chutback. He ruined your night, he ruined mine. He's a parasite, a sociopath military brat who wanders the earth changing people who don't need to be changed. I knew who I was. You did, too. We were fine before Chutback, so fuck the Chut, let's pin it all on him. Case closed.
5;5;Amortycan Grickfitti;Bruce Chutback;Yo, guys?
5;5;Amortycan Grickfitti;Summer;Bruce, you're kind of a drip, but know what's worse than self-appointed cool kids? People who think they're better than they are.
5;5;Amortycan Grickfitti;Morty;Yeah, i-it's not Bruce's fault we fell for his act, y'know? He just kinda sat there, with a jaw slack enough for us to project our insecurities on. I mean, th-th-that's on us.
5;5;Amortycan Grickfitti;Summer;We're not gonna bail on you, Bruce.
5;5;Amortycan Grickfitti;Alyson Hannigan;Okey-dokey, we'll do it the hard way.
5;5;Amortycan Grickfitti;Morty;Aaah! What the fuck?! 
5;5;Amortycan Grickfitti;Ship;I mean, blowing the place up was always an option. I just thought you guys might enjoy a less violent plan.
5;5;Amortycan Grickfitti;Morty;See, you have changed!
5;5;Amortycan Grickfitti;Beth;Dad, what is that?
5;5;Amortycan Grickfitti;Rick;An Aversion-Converting Inversion Reverter. It shoots concentrated pleasure-pain inverting shrapnel, which reverts the pleasure from pain back into the pain from pain. We're gonna kill them with 100% sincerity. We need an embarrassing level of it to jumpstart the process, too, so, Jerry, just be yourself.
5;5;Amortycan Grickfitti;Jerry;That's your solution? Humiliating me more?
5;5;Amortycan Grickfitti;Beth;Yeah, Dad, that doesn't seem fair. I mean, I know I shouldn't really talk right now, but at least I can prove I love Jerry through sexual gratification.
5;5;Amortycan Grickfitti;Jerry;Hubba hubba.
5;5;Amortycan Grickfitti;Rick;Fine! Then...damn it. I shouldn't have kept you in the dark about the deal I made with these evil dickweeds. You're way less cool than me, but it's not cool of me to celebrate that. If I'm genuinely cool, I should be able to love you, which I therefore do.
5;5;Amortycan Grickfitti;Hellraiser Demon;Nerds. 
5;5;Amortycan Grickfitti;Rick;Oh, thank God. Now follow me, you fucking hacks.
5;5;Amortycan Grickfitti;Hellraiser Demon;It hurts, but in a bad way! 
5;5;Amortycan Grickfitti;Hellraiser Demon;I regret so many piercings!
5;5;Amortycan Grickfitti;Hellraiser Demon;Where's First Aid Kit Face? Or at least Advil Teeth?
5;5;Amortycan Grickfitti;Hellraiser Demon;Ow! Bullets that hurt? Could this be the end of Mousetrap Nipples?
5;5;Amortycan Grickfitti;Hellraiser Demon;Hell got bad! I do not enjoy hell!
5;5;Amortycan Grickfitti;Hellraiser Demon;What -- What have you done?
5;5;Amortycan Grickfitti;Rick;Turned pain back into pain, bitch.
5;5;Amortycan Grickfitti;Hellraiser Demon;No! I don't want pain to hurt!
5;5;Amortycan Grickfitti;Hellraiser Demon;Baby.
5;5;Amortycan Grickfitti;Rick;Consider my debt paid.
5;5;Amortycan Grickfitti;Hellraiser Demon;Oh! The leather! It hurts my balls!
5;5;Amortycan Grickfitti;Rick;Jerry, uh, about down there --
5;5;Amortycan Grickfitti;Jerry;It's okay, Rick, you don't have to say it.
5;5;Amortycan Grickfitti;Rick;No, I do. I'll replace you next time. Make no mistake. What just transpired will never happen again.
5;5;Amortycan Grickfitti;Jerry;10-4, captain.
5;5;Amortycan Grickfitti;Beth;Oh, wow, it's late. We should get back to the kids.
5;5;Amortycan Grickfitti;Ship;Okay. Rick's headed home. We have to go.
5;5;Amortycan Grickfitti;Ship;Quick, get inside. I have to shower. Rick can smell adventure.
5;5;Amortycan Grickfitti;Jerry;Sorry, I farted.
5;5;Amortycan Grickfitti;Announcer;Hellamic Industries' brand-new product, Hellamic Sauce.
5;5;Amortycan Grickfitti;Beth;Hey, guys. We're home. How was your night?
5;5;Amortycan Grickfitti;Summer;Tight.
5;5;Amortycan Grickfitti;Morty;Breezy.
5;5;Amortycan Grickfitti;Bruce Chutback;Chill.
5;5;Amortycan Grickfitti;Jerry;You kids get into any trouble?
5;5;Amortycan Grickfitti;Morty;Nope.
5;5;Amortycan Grickfitti;Beth;You sure?
5;5;Amortycan Grickfitti;Summer;Yup.
5;5;Amortycan Grickfitti;Morty;Is that a skull?
5;5;Amortycan Grickfitti;Jerry;No, it's a baby's skull.
5;5;Amortycan Grickfitti;Beth;That's worse. It's still a school night.
5;5;Amortycan Grickfitti;Bruce Chutback;Yo, I just want to tell you guys, I had more than just fun hanging out with you tonight. I had the experience of a lifetime. But just to be up front about how I do this -- I-I can't really commit to a friendship for more than 24 hours. I need that time to get a general sense of your standing within your school's social hierarchy. And if that's solid, I'll see you around. Otherwise, no news is bad news. Cool? Bye-zies.
5;5;Amortycan Grickfitti;Morty;"Bye-zies""?"""
5;5;Amortycan Grickfitti;Summer;Cringe.
5;5;Amortycan Grickfitti;Morty;Sofa wine?
5;5;Amortycan Grickfitti;Summer;Sofa wine.
5;5;Amortycan Grickfitti;Brad;You're so cool, Bruce Chutback. What's your secret?
5;5;Amortycan Grickfitti;Bruce Chutback;Y'know, just be cool.
5;5;Amortycan Grickfitti;Sharon Lewis;Wait, didn't you wear those pants...yesterday?
5;5;Amortycan Grickfitti;Timmy Timtim;Hey, going home to not change your pants, Bruce Chut-Pants? Chut-Pants!
5;5;Amortycan Grickfitti;Summer;Damn. That's gonna stick.
5;5;Amortycan Grickfitti;Morty;This place is a jungle. I hope he can find solace in his own company.
5;5;Amortycan Grickfitti;Mailboxians;You like that? Shouldn't be standing on the curb! Boom, bitch!
5;6;Rick & Morty's Thanksploitation Spectacular;Morty;Are we -- are we gonna put it back when we're done with it?
5;6;Rick & Morty's Thanksploitation Spectacular;Rick;Why? The only thing of value on it is the secret treasure map. The rest is just instructions for running a country. And I'm pretty sure they're online.
5;6;Rick & Morty's Thanksploitation Spectacular;Morty;It just feels a little wrong --
5;6;Rick & Morty's Thanksploitation Spectacular;Rick;Morty, are you gonna be a fucking America nerd, or are you gonna be cool and steal the constitution with grandpa? Here, hold this while I crack the hermetic seal.
5;6;Rick & Morty's Thanksploitation Spectacular;Morty;W-why not just use this again?
5;6;Rick & Morty's Thanksploitation Spectacular;Rick;Morty! You just destroyed the map, and activated the giant assassin hidden in the Statue of Liberty!
5;6;Rick & Morty's Thanksploitation Spectacular;Morty;I'm sorry -- w-wait, what?
5;6;Rick & Morty's Thanksploitation Spectacular;Rick;It was a trojan horse, morty. Never trust the French. Alright, fun's fun, but now the federal government's gonna be pissed again. Way to go. And on America's birthday. Or whatever the fuck Thanksgiving is.
5;6;Rick & Morty's Thanksploitation Spectacular;Seal Team Leader;Rick and morty! You are under arrest and surrounded by an anti-portal shimmer! Come out with your hands up!
5;6;Rick & Morty's Thanksploitation Spectacular;Jerry;"Well, happy Thanksgiving to me. Can't wait to see what a shimmer"" does to my prostate."""
5;6;Rick & Morty's Thanksploitation Spectacular;Beth;Dad, can you please just end whatever this is --
5;6;Rick & Morty's Thanksploitation Spectacular;Rick;I understand you're upset, Mr. President. It's honestly all Morty's fault. But in the meantime, you really want to keep your army Of pointlessly camouflaged eagle scouts off my lawn.
5;6;Rick & Morty's Thanksploitation Spectacular;President;Don't tell me what I want, you anti-american piece of shit, you terrorist! 
5;6;Rick & Morty's Thanksploitation Spectacular;Rick;You know, you use that word so much It's lost all meaning, Mr. P. It's like, at this point, what's a terrorist? It's a guy you don't like. Big deal.
5;6;Rick & Morty's Thanksploitation Spectacular;Marine Soldier;Hoo-rah!
5;6;Rick & Morty's Thanksploitation Spectacular;Rick;Told you to stand down. You just lost two soldiers over here. Good men. Might be time to look at the terrorist in the mirror.
5;6;Rick & Morty's Thanksploitation Spectacular;President;You want a war?! I'll put your outer-space ass in a goddamn phantom zone with a bar of kryptonite soap around your neck. You're done, sanchez! You hear me?
5;6;Rick & Morty's Thanksploitation Spectacular;Rick;Oof. He's really pissed this time.
5;6;Rick & Morty's Thanksploitation Spectacular;Summer;Why don't you guys just fuck and get it over with.
5;6;Rick & Morty's Thanksploitation Spectacular;Rick;Okay, well thank you, Summer, but I think I've got a better option.
5;6;Rick & Morty's Thanksploitation Spectacular;Beth;Dad, no.
5;6;Rick & Morty's Thanksploitation Spectacular;Rick;Ehh... Hands are tied, sweetie. I have to turn myself into a turkey and trick the president into giving me a presidential turkey pardon.
5;6;Rick & Morty's Thanksploitation Spectacular;Jerry;Again? How many times have you done this?
5;6;Rick & Morty's Thanksploitation Spectacular;Rick;I don't know, Jerry, how many years have I lived here? Careful how you answer that.
5;6;Rick & Morty's Thanksploitation Spectacular;Morty;Geez, Rick, y'know, y-you've done this a lot. Don't you think the president might see it coming this time?
5;6;Rick & Morty's Thanksploitation Spectacular;Rick;He probably will, Morty. That's all part of the dance. In the past, I've inserted myself into the potential turkey pardonee population by brainwashing the presidential turkey wrangler prior to the ceremony. 
5;6;Rick & Morty's Thanksploitation Spectacular;President;But this time, the turkey wrangler's been euthanized, and the turkeys will be transported by armored military vehicles. 
5;6;Rick & Morty's Thanksploitation Spectacular;Rick;Vehicles manufactured by ghost corporations that I control.
5;6;Rick & Morty's Thanksploitation Spectacular;President;Which we have audited.
5;6;Rick & Morty's Thanksploitation Spectacular;Rick;Allowing me access to...
5;6;Rick & Morty's Thanksploitation Spectacular;President;Central computers...
5;6;Rick & Morty's Thanksploitation Spectacular;Rick;To track the...
5;6;Rick & Morty's Thanksploitation Spectacular;President;Real armored transports, which he can never...
5;6;Rick & Morty's Thanksploitation Spectacular;Rick;Totally track and sneak aboard.
5;6;Rick & Morty's Thanksploitation Spectacular;President;And even if he does, he'll be on a truck full of turkeys and fully armed marines.
5;6;Rick & Morty's Thanksploitation Spectacular;Rick;Who won't recognize me because the human eye is inherently face blind to turkeys.
5;6;Rick & Morty's Thanksploitation Spectacular;President;Fortunately, those marines won't have human eyes. They'll have turkey eyes.
5;6;Rick & Morty's Thanksploitation Spectacular;Vice-President Dwayne;Jesus ever-loving christ, why don't you two just fuck and get it over with?
5;6;Rick & Morty's Thanksploitation Spectacular;President;Careful, dwayne. You're only vice president because i need 10% of the white vote.
5;6;Rick & Morty's Thanksploitation Spectacular;Vice-President Dwayne;There's a giant french assassin attacking New York, and you're using the war room to measure dicks with your alcoholic sci-fi boyfriend?
5;6;Rick & Morty's Thanksploitation Spectacular;President;Rick Sanchez is more dangerous than some steam-powered french bitch, and New York can handle its own global emergencies. General? Initiate operation deep gobble.
5;6;Rick & Morty's Thanksploitation Spectacular;Mary Lou;Coop, not on Thanksgiving.
5;6;Rick & Morty's Thanksploitation Spectacular;Coop;It's what I trained for, Mary Lou.
5;6;Rick & Morty's Thanksploitation Spectacular;Mary Lou;It ain't our fight. 
5;6;Rick & Morty's Thanksploitation Spectacular;Coop;Baby. That little race car driver you got bakin' in your belly. What world you want him rearin' up in? One where some... Spiky-haired doctor who In a lab coat can change the color of the sky? Or a world where he can fill his pickup with hot dogs and drive it to a jukebox full of our demographic's current favorite music?
5;6;Rick & Morty's Thanksploitation Spectacular;Mary Lou;Obviously the latter, but --
5;6;Rick & Morty's Thanksploitation Spectacular;Coop;Well, that world, Mary Lou, the one with those meals, vehicles, and songs people in this 30-mile area prefer... That world needs a few good men. In a secret Pentagon lab. Turning into turkeys.
5;6;Rick & Morty's Thanksploitation Spectacular;Mary Lou;You come back without feathers, Coop.
5;6;Rick & Morty's Thanksploitation Spectacular;Bartender;God, I love this country.
5;6;Rick & Morty's Thanksploitation Spectacular;Coop;Hoooo-ah!
5;6;Rick & Morty's Thanksploitation Spectacular;General Green;These pills contain tracking chips that identify each of you as individuals. That will be important later.
5;6;Rick & Morty's Thanksploitation Spectacular;Turkeyfied Marine 1;Alright, boys, search every bird. If Sanchez is here, I wanna hear you gobblin'.
5;6;Rick & Morty's Thanksploitation Spectacular;Turkeyfied Marine 2;Let me look at you, scum. Get outta here, you wobbleneck.
5;6;Rick & Morty's Thanksploitation Spectacular;Turkeyfied Marine 3;Sarge, this -- this ain't like the simulation, man. I don't like it.
5;6;Rick & Morty's Thanksploitation Spectacular;Turkeyfied Marine 1;Keep it together, Martinez. Eyes are on the ground, sir. No sign of Einstein.
5;6;Rick & Morty's Thanksploitation Spectacular;President;Stay frosty, gentlemen. I want this pardoning pipeline airtight.
5;6;Rick & Morty's Thanksploitation Spectacular;Marine Soldier;Sir! We have hacked the garage door. We are in. Eyes on the bogey.
5;6;Rick & Morty's Thanksploitation Spectacular;President;Or you've got eyes on a robot.
5;6;Rick & Morty's Thanksploitation Spectacular;Marine Soldier;All due respect, sir, I know flesh when I see it!
5;6;Rick & Morty's Thanksploitation Spectacular;Turkeyfied Rick;Those flesh-covered robots should buy us some time. The pardonable turkeys should be on that truck. Ship, go stealth.
5;6;Rick & Morty's Thanksploitation Spectacular;Turkeyfied Marine 1;Rodriguez, Fincher. Get eyes on that.
5;6;Rick & Morty's Thanksploitation Spectacular;Turkeyfied Rick;Huh. Turkey marines. The President came to play. Jam those two radios.
5;6;Rick & Morty's Thanksploitation Spectacular;Ship;Confirmed.
5;6;Rick & Morty's Thanksploitation Spectacular;Turkeyfied Marine 4;Ah! Geez!
5;6;Rick & Morty's Thanksploitation Spectacular;Turkeyfied Marine 1;Fincher, Rodriguez, come in!
5;6;Rick & Morty's Thanksploitation Spectacular;Rick;Copy, copy, tango, all good. Just a couple of branches on the roof.
5;6;Rick & Morty's Thanksploitation Spectacular;Turkeyfied Marine 1;Don't ever turn your radio off again.
5;6;Rick & Morty's Thanksploitation Spectacular;Flesh Robot Rick;We will not surrender.
5;6;Rick & Morty's Thanksploitation Spectacular;Flesh Robot Morty;We will never surrender.
5;6;Rick & Morty's Thanksploitation Spectacular;Flesh Robot Rick;We will not surrender.
5;6;Rick & Morty's Thanksploitation Spectacular;General Green;Oh, yeah? Bring in the David Blaine box.
5;6;Rick & Morty's Thanksploitation Spectacular;Summer;Damn, is that a David Blaine box?
5;6;Rick & Morty's Thanksploitation Spectacular;Jerry;I told you we should have just gone to my parents' house.
5;6;Rick & Morty's Thanksploitation Spectacular;Beth;No, you didn't.
5;6;Rick & Morty's Thanksploitation Spectacular;Jerry;Well, I didn't say it out loud, But it should be well known by now that I'd always rather be there.
5;6;Rick & Morty's Thanksploitation Spectacular;Flesh Robot Rick;Oh, god, oh no!
5;6;Rick & Morty's Thanksploitation Spectacular;Flesh Robot Morty;Aw, geez, rick!
5;6;Rick & Morty's Thanksploitation Spectacular;General Green;Sir, we've got Rick and Morty inside the box!
5;6;Rick & Morty's Thanksploitation Spectacular;President;Then that confirms it.
5;6;Rick & Morty's Thanksploitation Spectacular;General Green;Sir?
5;6;Rick & Morty's Thanksploitation Spectacular;President;No David Blaine box can hold Rick Sanchez. Scan the turkey truck!
5;6;Rick & Morty's Thanksploitation Spectacular;Marine;Huh. That's weird. Id chips for Fincher and Rodriguez are glitching.
5;6;Rick & Morty's Thanksploitation Spectacular;President;Sanchez... I'll deal with this bastard myself.
5;6;Rick & Morty's Thanksploitation Spectacular;General Green;Sir, don't be a cowboy. You can't get re-elected dead.
5;6;Rick & Morty's Thanksploitation Spectacular;Scientist;System is calibrated, sir. That pill contains a tracking chip that will identify --
5;6;Rick & Morty's Thanksploitation Spectacular;President;I know, it'll be important later! Do it.
5;6;Rick & Morty's Thanksploitation Spectacular;Reporter;Moments from now, The President will be pardoning a turkey...
5;6;Rick & Morty's Thanksploitation Spectacular;Turkeyfied Rick;Home stretch, Morty. Here comes dipshit right on schedule. Nothing can go wrong now.
5;6;Rick & Morty's Thanksploitation Spectacular;Turkeyfied Morty;Jesus, is that --
5;6;Rick & Morty's Thanksploitation Spectacular;Turkeyfied Rick;Oh, shit! The President has the upper hand. G-grandpa fucked up. Sunglasses on. Act like a turkey!
5;6;Rick & Morty's Thanksploitation Spectacular;Turkeyfied Morty;What? Wha-- are you scared?
5;6;Rick & Morty's Thanksploitation Spectacular;Turkeyfied Rick;Act like a turkey!
5;6;Rick & Morty's Thanksploitation Spectacular;Turkeyfied Marine 1;That's Rodriguez and Fincher, sir.
5;6;Rick & Morty's Thanksploitation Spectacular;Turkeyfied President;It's Rick and Morty, you useless fucking stump humper! Sorry, don't tell 10% of your friends I called you that.
5;6;Rick & Morty's Thanksploitation Spectacular;Turkeyfied Rick;Mr. President.
5;6;Rick & Morty's Thanksploitation Spectacular;Turkeyfied President;Sanchez, admit it. You lose. Say it and I'll let your loser ass go.
5;6;Rick & Morty's Thanksploitation Spectacular;Turkeyfied President;Did you just try to spit in my face with no saliva gland?
5;6;Rick & Morty's Thanksploitation Spectacular;Turkeyfied Rick;Just pardon me, dick. 
5;6;Rick & Morty's Thanksploitation Spectacular;Turkeyfied President;Why the hell would I?
5;6;Rick & Morty's Thanksploitation Spectacular;Turkeyfied Rick;Oh, I dunno, 'cause if I move to canada, they'll be the best country!
5;6;Rick & Morty's Thanksploitation Spectacular;Turkeyfied President;I'll peck your goddamn eyes out!
5;6;Rick & Morty's Thanksploitation Spectacular;Turkeyfied Morty;Ow! Hey!
5;6;Rick & Morty's Thanksploitation Spectacular;Turkeyfied Rick;Shit! My plume!
5;6;Rick & Morty's Thanksploitation Spectacular;Turkeyfied Morty;Hey, back off!
5;6;Rick & Morty's Thanksploitation Spectacular;Turkeyfied Marine 1;Blueberries! We got blueberries down! Hold your positions, it's a feeding frenzy!
5;6;Rick & Morty's Thanksploitation Spectacular;Turkeyfied Marine 3;I-I can't see. I mean, I can see 270 degrees... It's too many degrees!
5;6;Rick & Morty's Thanksploitation Spectacular;Turkeyfied Marine 1;Sir, we are losing the mental game down here.
5;6;Rick & Morty's Thanksploitation Spectacular;General Green;Keep it together, soldier! Potus is still in that pen --
5;6;Rick & Morty's Thanksploitation Spectacular;Vice-President Dwayne;We just lost New York to France! Pull out The President right now!
5;6;Rick & Morty's Thanksploitation Spectacular;General Green;Gobble tango -- I want potus out of that pen! That is an order! Locate the president's chip!
5;6;Rick & Morty's Thanksploitation Spectacular;Turkeyfied Marine 2;Roger, roger. There he is, I got him. Let's go, boys! Let's fly out the eagle!
5;6;Rick & Morty's Thanksploitation Spectacular;Turkeyfied President;Hey, that's not me!
5;6;Rick & Morty's Thanksploitation Spectacular;Turkeyfied Marine 2;Package is secure. Pull us out.
5;6;Rick & Morty's Thanksploitation Spectacular;Computer;Reinjecting subject DNA.
5;6;Rick & Morty's Thanksploitation Spectacular;Vice-President Dwayne;Hoppin' jehovah, you look like five pounds of shit in a whore's lunchbox. You alright, Mr. President?
5;6;Rick & Morty's Thanksploitation Spectacular;Turkey President;Yes. I am... The President.
5;6;Rick & Morty's Thanksploitation Spectacular;Vice-President Dwayne;Clean his ass up and get him to the war room.
5;6;Rick & Morty's Thanksploitation Spectacular;Turkeyfied Marine 1;Hey! Gobble squad! You got the wrong guy, you morons!
5;6;Rick & Morty's Thanksploitation Spectacular;Marine;Look at this dumb piece of shit. Gobbling away. Get back in there!
5;6;Rick & Morty's Thanksploitation Spectacular;General Green;Alright boys, you heard the vp. Pardon is tits up. Pack up and ship out! As for you, Sanchez... Bon appétit.
5;6;Rick & Morty's Thanksploitation Spectacular;Turkeyfied Morty;Where is this elevator going?
5;6;Rick & Morty's Thanksploitation Spectacular;Turkeyfied President;Where all the unchosen turkeys go. The feeding chamber.
5;6;Rick & Morty's Thanksploitation Spectacular;Turkeyfied Rick;What the fuck is that?
5;6;Rick & Morty's Thanksploitation Spectacular;Turkeyfied President;Not what... Who.
5;6;Rick & Morty's Thanksploitation Spectacular;Franklin D. Roosevelt;The only thing to fear is... Me!
5;6;Rick & Morty's Thanksploitation Spectacular;Turkeyfied Rick;How the fuck does the White House have a cloned spider of FDR?
5;6;Rick & Morty's Thanksploitation Spectacular;Turkeyfied President;"It's no clone, it's FDR. He was a Guinea pig for the polio vaccine. We asked ourselves what walks the most?"""""
5;6;Rick & Morty's Thanksploitation Spectacular;Turkeyfied Morty;"We?"" You're taking credit for this?"""
5;6;Rick & Morty's Thanksploitation Spectacular;Turkeyfied President;The office comes with baggage, Morty.
5;6;Rick & Morty's Thanksploitation Spectacular;Turkeyfied Morty;Rick, I'm afraid to die!
5;6;Rick & Morty's Thanksploitation Spectacular;Turkeyfied Rick;You won't have to be for long, Morty! We're due to return to human form any second!
5;6;Rick & Morty's Thanksploitation Spectacular;Turkeyfied Morty;Then what?
5;6;Rick & Morty's Thanksploitation Spectacular;Turkeyfied Rick;Then we just have to not get eaten by the spider!
5;6;Rick & Morty's Thanksploitation Spectacular;Morty;Oh, so in other words, be afraid to die?
5;6;Rick & Morty's Thanksploitation Spectacular;Rick;Morty, if winning an argument is that important to you, you were never alive!
5;6;Rick & Morty's Thanksploitation Spectacular;Franklin D. Roosevelt;Time for a new deal... Murder!
5;6;Rick & Morty's Thanksploitation Spectacular;Turkeyfied President;I'm sick of hearing how iconic you were! Try having an historical administration after Facebook goes online, you old-timey bitch!
5;6;Rick & Morty's Thanksploitation Spectacular;Rick;Morty, tear open that panel!
5;6;Rick & Morty's Thanksploitation Spectacular;Morty;How's this for a fireside chat?
5;6;Rick & Morty's Thanksploitation Spectacular;Rick;Woof. You just killed FDR.
5;6;Rick & Morty's Thanksploitation Spectacular;Morty;He was a monster, though. 
5;6;Rick & Morty's Thanksploitation Spectacular;Rick;Don't mythologize him. He was a politician. Speaking of, you kind of saved our bacon there, so I'll make you a deal. You pardon us and I'll make you human.
5;6;Rick & Morty's Thanksploitation Spectacular;Morty;Wrong turkey.
5;6;Rick & Morty's Thanksploitation Spectacular;Rick;Man, the face blindness is real.
5;6;Rick & Morty's Thanksploitation Spectacular;Turkey President;I'd like these... Men... Turned back into humans, please.
5;6;Rick & Morty's Thanksploitation Spectacular;Scientist;Uh, yes, of course, Mr. President. But I thought we already rehumanized all the turkified marines.
5;6;Rick & Morty's Thanksploitation Spectacular;Turkey President;I'd like these men turned back into humans. I am the president.
5;6;Rick & Morty's Thanksploitation Spectacular;Scientist;Yes, sir. Uh, sure thing.
5;6;Rick & Morty's Thanksploitation Spectacular;Turkey President;Increase their strength by 1000%.
5;6;Rick & Morty's Thanksploitation Spectacular;Scientist;But... That wouldn't be human.
5;6;Rick & Morty's Thanksploitation Spectacular;Turkey President;Turkeys have always been more than human.
5;6;Rick & Morty's Thanksploitation Spectacular;Scientist;Okay, uh, so right there, now I'm starting to --
5;6;Rick & Morty's Thanksploitation Spectacular;Turkey President;I am selling New York to France. And giving all of the money to Congress.
5;6;Rick & Morty's Thanksploitation Spectacular;Congress Member 1;Now that's how you do it! 
5;6;Rick & Morty's Thanksploitation Spectacular;Congress Member 2;He became president today.
5;6;Rick & Morty's Thanksploitation Spectacular;President;That's right, murmur! And when you're done, get me some pants.
5;6;Rick & Morty's Thanksploitation Spectacular;Vice-President Dwayne;If you're the president, who the hell have we been governing the country with for the last three hours?
5;6;Rick & Morty's Thanksploitation Spectacular;President;An impostor, you good for nothing idiot! You humanized the wrong turkey!
5;6;Rick & Morty's Thanksploitation Spectacular;Turkey President;It's possible. We shouldn't leave anything to chance. Wouldn't want congress working with the wrong president.
5;6;Rick & Morty's Thanksploitation Spectacular;Vice-President Dwayne;"A very good point, Mr. President. Do we believe this fine feathered, collaborative gentleman to be our commander-in-chief? Or are we gonna let Mr. Cash bar at the Christmas party"" stay in office? All in favor of Turkey President?"""
5;6;Rick & Morty's Thanksploitation Spectacular;President;You can't be serious. You think he cares about America?
5;6;Rick & Morty's Thanksploitation Spectacular;Turkey President;Is that why this is happening to you? Because you cared about America? Guards, these men are... Oh, what is the word? Uh, terrorists.
5;6;Rick & Morty's Thanksploitation Spectacular;Rick;Okay, screw this. Go, go, Sanchez laser fists. Oh, shit, I was a turkey for a while, wasn't I? Okay, guy's pretty strong.
5;6;Rick & Morty's Thanksploitation Spectacular;President;Mary Todd Lincoln! Who's dead weight now, bitch?
5;6;Rick & Morty's Thanksploitation Spectacular;Rick;You should regain feeling in your ass in a minute. Sorry my turrets blew up your motorcycle.
5;6;Rick & Morty's Thanksploitation Spectacular;President;Just give me some goddamn clothes.
5;6;Rick & Morty's Thanksploitation Spectacular;Rick;Must suck to have your only safe haven be my house. Y-you want your regular outfit, or should we dress you like a terrorist?
5;6;Rick & Morty's Thanksploitation Spectacular;President;I don't need to be here, and I'm still The President.
5;6;Rick & Morty's Thanksploitation Spectacular;Rick;Oh, glad to hear it. That means you can give me that pardon. Or -- or I could put you out with the trash.
5;6;Rick & Morty's Thanksploitation Spectacular;President;What is your problem?! Why do you hate this country?
5;6;Rick & Morty's Thanksploitation Spectacular;Rick;I hate every country in the universe, brother! They're job placement programs for the politicians that invent them --
5;6;Rick & Morty's Thanksploitation Spectacular;President;"Okay, Fight Club"". I get paid to protect the sidelines you sit on!"""
5;6;Rick & Morty's Thanksploitation Spectacular;Rick;You get paid to make sports metaphors!

5;6;Rick & Morty's Thanksploitation Spectacular;Morty;Guys, maybe you're both right and both wrong.
5;6;Rick & Morty's Thanksploitation Spectacular;Rick;Shut up, Morty!
5;6;Rick & Morty's Thanksploitation Spectacular;President;Shut up, Morty! You little bitch, you destroyed the Constitution. You're the biggest booger eater here!
5;6;Rick & Morty's Thanksploitation Spectacular;Beth;Do not talk to my son that way.
5;6;Rick & Morty's Thanksploitation Spectacular;President;Sorry, Mrs. Smith.
5;6;Rick & Morty's Thanksploitation Spectacular;Beth;The two of you are ruining Thanksgiving. Together. And you can both either come to the table and eat food with my family, or you can keep doing what you're doing at the corner bar.
5;6;Rick & Morty's Thanksploitation Spectacular;Rick;Bars actually suck at Thanksgiving.
5;6;Rick & Morty's Thanksploitation Spectacular;Dorothy;I'm still trying to sort through this. One of you wishes you had the personal quality known as courage. But the other two of you want actual vital organs?

5;6;Rick & Morty's Thanksploitation Spectacular;Rick;Mm-hmm.
5;6;Rick & Morty's Thanksploitation Spectacular;Morty;Good green beans, mom.
5;6;Rick & Morty's Thanksploitation Spectacular;Summer;The turkey's raw, dad. Shit's potato bunz.
5;6;Rick & Morty's Thanksploitation Spectacular;Jerry;Sorry, Summer, the United States enclosed us in a shimmer bubble that scrambled my oven timer. So I guess elections do have consequences.
5;6;Rick & Morty's Thanksploitation Spectacular;President;Eat my ass, Jerry. I've seen your IRS records. You can blame me once you have taxable income.
5;6;Rick & Morty's Thanksploitation Spectacular;Rick;Yes, Jerry is a piece of shit. I agree.
5;6;Rick & Morty's Thanksploitation Spectacular;Morty;Um, guys? What's that?
5;6;Rick & Morty's Thanksploitation Spectacular;Reporter;Paula, as you can see, President Curtis has enacted a plan to turn all turkeys in America into hybrid super soldiers. The move has 100% approval from Congress, following its third pay raise in six hours. Back to you.
5;6;Rick & Morty's Thanksploitation Spectacular;President;My god, the bastard's unhinged! There won't be a single bird left in DC!
5;6;Rick & Morty's Thanksploitation Spectacular;Summer;Oh, wow, wiping out a native population on Thanksgiving? That's never happened before.
5;6;Rick & Morty's Thanksploitation Spectacular;President;What did you just say?
5;6;Rick & Morty's Thanksploitation Spectacular;Summer;Well, I-I associated Thanksgiving with genocide. It's what young people do. I wasn't trying to --
5;6;Rick & Morty's Thanksploitation Spectacular;President;The Crypt of the New World! That could be our one chance to turn this thing around!
5;6;Rick & Morty's Thanksploitation Spectacular;Rick;You know about the Crypt? Ugh, so the treasure's already gone.
5;6;Rick & Morty's Thanksploitation Spectacular;President;Wait, is that why you were stealing the Constitution? You old fart dick. The Crypt of the New World isn't a treasure. But it might be our only hope. Come on.
5;6;Rick & Morty's Thanksploitation Spectacular;Morty;But isn't the Crypt underneath DC? The Turkey President's got an army. An actual army. And an air force. And marines --
5;6;Rick & Morty's Thanksploitation Spectacular;Rick;Slow down, Morty. Walk us through every military service. Does somebody have a pen?
5;6;Rick & Morty's Thanksploitation Spectacular;President;We've got something more powerful than every army in the world. Well, no, we don't, but with the right speech, we could get a handful of well-trained hillbillies.
5;6;Rick & Morty's Thanksploitation Spectacular;Rick;Eh, it worked against the British. I'm in.
5;6;Rick & Morty's Thanksploitation Spectacular;Coop;Birds replacin' people. What would Johnny Cash or Dale Earnhardt say?

5;6;Rick & Morty's Thanksploitation Spectacular;Coop;He's my boss, Marvin.
5;6;Rick & Morty's Thanksploitation Spectacular;President;It's okay. Mistrusting presidents is a patriotic duty. And that guy on TV isn't me. He's a turkey infused with my DNA.
5;6;Rick & Morty's Thanksploitation Spectacular;Bartender;I'll be damned. Well, I'm racist.

5;6;Rick & Morty's Thanksploitation Spectacular;President;"And I need you. And 10% of your baby. Now, look, I know it's gonna take more than some speech. But what is a speech? Isn't it just a question? And isn't that a question too? Speeches are words. Repeated words. Listed words. Repeated lists of repeated words. None of that matters. You know what does matter? Me. Asking you. Will you do what I say?"""""
5;6;Rick & Morty's Thanksploitation Spectacular;Coop;Just two questions, chief. Lock? And load? They're rhetorical, sir! Lock and load!
5;6;Rick & Morty's Thanksploitation Spectacular;General Green;"Sir, we've got Rick and Morty coming in what appears to be an unlicensed Star Wars"" AT-AT. Or as the millennials say, a-t, a-t."""
5;6;Rick & Morty's Thanksploitation Spectacular;Turkey President;So it begins. Gobblers! Tonight, we rise!
5;6;Rick & Morty's Thanksploitation Spectacular;Robot Morty;Aww, geez, geez, geez.
5;6;Rick & Morty's Thanksploitation Spectacular;President;Nice driving, Sanchez.
5;6;Rick & Morty's Thanksploitation Spectacular;Coop;Wire's down, pen is clear.
5;6;Rick & Morty's Thanksploitation Spectacular;President;You know the goddamn rules! If you see something clucking or pecking, put a buckshot in its panties.
5;6;Rick & Morty's Thanksploitation Spectacular;Morty;Jesus christ! T-they got Johnson!
5;6;Rick & Morty's Thanksploitation Spectacular;President;He got off easy.
5;6;Rick & Morty's Thanksploitation Spectacular;Cooper;Hold off the bastards!
5;6;Rick & Morty's Thanksploitation Spectacular;Morty;What now, rick?
5;6;Rick & Morty's Thanksploitation Spectacular;Rick;Time to turn up the broiler.
5;6;Rick & Morty's Thanksploitation Spectacular;Morty;Whoa, I-is that --
5;6;Rick & Morty's Thanksploitation Spectacular;President;The Crypt of the New World. The treasure you were after is this country's oldest secret. One disguised by centuries of Thanksgiving folklore.
5;6;Rick & Morty's Thanksploitation Spectacular;Morty;Is that... A turkey dinosaur?
5;6;Rick & Morty's Thanksploitation Spectacular;President;America's original rulers. Merciless beasts, grazing on the flesh of cowering humans. Then, in the 15th Century, a vessel crashed. Two vessels, really. On board -- Our saviors. Sanchez, pull that lever at the same time I do.
5;6;Rick & Morty's Thanksploitation Spectacular;Rick;Oh, fuck, they're gonna fight!
5;6;Rick & Morty's Thanksploitation Spectacular;Morty;No, wait, they love each other!
5;6;Rick & Morty's Thanksploitation Spectacular;President;They were at war when they arrived, but they united over their hatred of turkeys. And what they love even more than each other is kicking turkey butt. Gentlemen! Ba'ruka dar tin'in yo-tei!
5;6;Rick & Morty's Thanksploitation Spectacular;President;It's working! Come on, Sanchez, let's power down the humanizer ray.
5;6;Rick & Morty's Thanksploitation Spectacular;Marine 1;Whose side are we on?
5;6;Rick & Morty's Thanksploitation Spectacular;Marine 2;I don't know, but we've done enough to pay for college.
5;6;Rick & Morty's Thanksploitation Spectacular;President;Look, we're almost there.
5;6;Rick & Morty's Thanksploitation Spectacular;Turkey President;Sorry, my turn for a surprise.
5;6;Rick & Morty's Thanksploitation Spectacular;Morty;Damn, this guy loves arriving from the shadows.
5;6;Rick & Morty's Thanksploitation Spectacular;President;Look around. You can't beat our ancient warriors.
5;6;Rick & Morty's Thanksploitation Spectacular;Turkey President;Can't I? My kind has always dealt with predators. That's why we sleep in trees. And that's why, in the wild, we fly. Now you must choose --- Fight me, or stop that weapon from turning all of America's turkeys into a new master race.
5;6;Rick & Morty's Thanksploitation Spectacular;President;You dumb dipshit, there's three of us, and two of us are spacemen. Obviously they're gonna save America and bring that monument home. And I'm gonna kick your ass. Oh, and, Sanchez? You got your pardon.
5;6;Rick & Morty's Thanksploitation Spectacular;Morty;Aw.
5;6;Rick & Morty's Thanksploitation Spectacular;Rick;Shut up, Morty. Come on.
5;6;Rick & Morty's Thanksploitation Spectacular;President;Let's go, bitch.
5;6;Rick & Morty's Thanksploitation Spectacular;Turkey President;So be it.
5;6;Rick & Morty's Thanksploitation Spectacular;Morty;Is it true what turkey man said? That turkeys sleep in trees?
5;6;Rick & Morty's Thanksploitation Spectacular;Rick;Who the hell cares, Morty? Let's just deactivate this shit.
5;6;Rick & Morty's Thanksploitation Spectacular;Voice;Calibrating. Targeting all American turkeys.
5;6;Rick & Morty's Thanksploitation Spectacular;Rick;Oh, my god, they gave it a voice? Who is this for? We're in space.
5;6;Rick & Morty's Thanksploitation Spectacular;Morty;Geez, rick, I-I-I guess them?
5;6;Rick & Morty's Thanksploitation Spectacular;Rick;Morty, use this carefully. Crack the humanizer core and cut the blue wire. You hear me? Blue wire.
5;6;Rick & Morty's Thanksploitation Spectacular;Morty;Wha-- why don't we just blow it up?
5;6;Rick & Morty's Thanksploitation Spectacular;Rick;It's a national monument, fucking nut! We just got pardoned. You really wanna do this again next year?
5;6;Rick & Morty's Thanksploitation Spectacular;President;You forgot something, turkey man. No matter what you got people to believe, I'm still the goddamn president.
5;6;Rick & Morty's Thanksploitation Spectacular;Turkey President;And you forget, in the one day I've had your job, I've learned 10 times as much.
5;6;Rick & Morty's Thanksploitation Spectacular;President;I've underestimated you.
5;6;Rick & Morty's Thanksploitation Spectacular;Turkey President;For the last time.
5;6;Rick & Morty's Thanksploitation Spectacular;Morty;Rick, they're not exactly primary colors! A-are -- are we cool with, like, t-turquoise?
5;6;Rick & Morty's Thanksploitation Spectacular;Rick;Are you kidding me, Morty? Just cut the damn thing!
5;6;Rick & Morty's Thanksploitation Spectacular;Morty;Oh, shit, oh  --
5;6;Rick & Morty's Thanksploitation Spectacular;Voice;Targets acquired. Activating weapon.
5;6;Rick & Morty's Thanksploitation Spectacular;Morty;Oh, shit! Oooooooh!
5;6;Rick & Morty's Thanksploitation Spectacular;Voice;Heritage destroyed.
5;6;Rick & Morty's Thanksploitation Spectacular;Rick;Morty! God damn it, you had one job!
5;6;Rick & Morty's Thanksploitation Spectacular;President;I beat you. Look at me, you turkey ass bitch. Wait, why are you -- Is that a wishbone?
5;6;Rick & Morty's Thanksploitation Spectacular;Turkey President;I wish to explode.
5;6;Rick & Morty's Thanksploitation Spectacular;Rick;I wasn't sure when to pull you out. I-I assumed you were running through your whole life.
5;6;Rick & Morty's Thanksploitation Spectacular;President;Yes. And what a life it was. Gentlemen, thank you once again for saving this nation.
5;6;Rick & Morty's Thanksploitation Spectacular;Indian;Slloosh garg blurrg.
5;6;Rick & Morty's Thanksploitation Spectacular;President;I don't speak googa. The CIA only taught me your activation phrase. But if I could say anything... I'd say give America one more chance.
5;6;Rick & Morty's Thanksploitation Spectacular;Pilgrim;Kalaak 'ha benben prilo garg.
5;6;Rick & Morty's Thanksploitation Spectacular;Rick;Oh, my god, they're gonna fight. Th-they're really gonna fight.
5;6;Rick & Morty's Thanksploitation Spectacular;Morty;Aw, they love each other!
5;6;Rick & Morty's Thanksploitation Spectacular;Rick;Never gets old.
5;6;Rick & Morty's Thanksploitation Spectacular;President;I'll never get tired of that.
5;6;Rick & Morty's Thanksploitation Spectacular;Morty;So... After those aliens discovered America...
5;6;Rick & Morty's Thanksploitation Spectacular;President;They went into hibernation, leaving us the technology we used to lead the free world. That and also to do stuff like slavery.
5;6;Rick & Morty's Thanksploitation Spectacular;Morty;I always thought we were... More special than that. Like we invented everything and did everything, and that's why we own everything. Now I-I-I-I don't know what to feel.
5;6;Rick & Morty's Thanksploitation Spectacular;President;Feel thankful, morty. Feel thankful.
5;6;Rick & Morty's Thanksploitation Spectacular;Mary Lou;I know, baby. Coop, honey, should we get lucky charms or kibble bibbitz?
5;6;Rick & Morty's Thanksploitation Spectacular;Coop;You know we can't afford either.
5;6;Rick & Morty's Thanksploitation Spectacular;Mary Lou;Baby, the president owes you. You saved him.
5;6;Rick & Morty's Thanksploitation Spectacular;Coop;Ain't his fault our insurance got cut. They gotta build missiles.
5;6;Rick & Morty's Thanksploitation Spectacular;Mary Lou;Ugh, fine, just -- can y'all hold Jakey for a second?
5;6;Rick & Morty's Thanksploitation Spectacular;Bag Boy;What the hell's he doin?
5;6;Rick & Morty's Thanksploitation Spectacular;Deli Guy;I think he's foraging. Crazy bastard thinks he's a turkey. Well, I refuse to pay for this man's health care.
5;7;Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion;Rick;Boob World! Boob World! It's a world for you, but it's actually two. Boob World!

5;7;Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion;Summer;Boob World! Boob World! It's a world for you, but it's actually two. Boob World!
5;7;Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion;Summer;"I gotta say, Morty, it's weird that you wanted me to come, but I'm actually exstyched"" about it. That's ""excited"", ""stoked"", and ""psyched""."""
5;7;Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion;Morty;I didn't want you to come. Talk to Rick.
5;7;Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion;Rick;"Truth is, Summer, Boob World's been at the center of a few protests every day for 30 years, so they've recently rebranded as a boob empowerment experience"", and if we bring a female, we get in for free."""
5;7;Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion;Summer;So, I'm like, what, a Coke can you're taking to Six Flags?
5;7;Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion;Morty;No, 'cause once you get into Six Flags, you can throw your Coke can away.
5;7;Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion;Rick;No fuckin' way. It can't be.
5;7;Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion;Rick;Holy shit, holy shit, holy shit!
5;7;Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion;Morty;Oh, look at that.
5;7;Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion;Summer;What is it?
5;7;Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion;Morty;A Gotron Ferret.
5;7;Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion;Rick;It's not a Gotron Ferret, Morty, it's THE Blue Gotron Ferret! Boob World is canceled.
5;7;Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion;Morty;No! Rick! No, you promised! You always do this.
5;7;Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion;Rick;Tell you what, Morty, I'll let you choose, do you really think Boob World â€”
5;7;Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion;Morty;Yes.
5;7;Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion;Rick;Let me finish. â€” is more important â€”
5;7;Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion;Morty;Yes!
5;7;Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion;Rick;Let me finish! â€” than having all five of the only five Gotron Ferrets in the universe?
5;7;Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion;Morty;Are you finished? Yes! So let's go.
5;7;Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion;Rick;Summer, help me hook the winch up to the ferret.
5;7;Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion;Summer;Sure.
5;7;Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion;Morty;What the hell? You said you were letting me choose.
5;7;Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion;Rick;Yeah, whether to break my fucking heart. You chose badly. 
5;7;Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion;Morty;That's how it all began. To my sister it was just another game. But what she didn't know â€”
5;7;Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion;Summer;That was the moment everything changed.
5;7;Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion;Morty;Wait, what?
5;7;Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion;Summer;I had gotten my first taste of respect, and my first voiceover.
5;7;Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion;Morty;I can hear you. Can you hear me?
5;7;Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion;Summer;And I knew then and there, I wanted more of both.
5;7;Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion;Morty;Hello?
5;7;Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion;Rick;Beth, Jerry, do something fun with us! A giant monster's attacking in the Nibblenug system. Your suits are in the bathroom.
5;7;Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion;Morty;Mine smells skeleton-y.
5;7;Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion;Jerry;I have a chiropractor appointment.
5;7;Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion;Beth;What are you involving us in?
5;7;Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion;Morty;Rick's been collecting Gotron Ferrets, and now that he has all five, he can combine them into â€”
5;7;Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion;Rick;Morty, for Christ's sake, spoilers!
5;7;Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion;Summer;Spoilers, Morty! We don't need to sell this to anyone, there's a giant monster attacking.
5;7;Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion;Beth;In the Nibblenug system. Since when does this house care about alien lives, we don't even watch British television.
5;7;Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion;Rick;Told you. Let's just get Gene from next door and a homeless guy.
5;7;Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion;Summer;No, hold on, fuck Gene, fuck the homeless. Your kids and their grandpa are asking you to do an activity with them, when did that stop being a parent's wettest dream?
5;7;Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion;Beth;I guess around the time our family created a giant incest baby and the government launched it into space.
5;7;Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion;Summer;Oh my god, we made a giant incest baby. Oh my god, you might be a clone. I exist because you guys failed to abort me. We get the family we get, not the one we want, and if you want to keep the one you got, get your asses into some anime spacesuits!
5;7;Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion;Jerry;Fair enough.
5;7;Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion;Beth;Okay.
5;7;Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion;Rick;Good work, Summer-camp.
5;7;Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion;Morty;"Yeah, I'm excitoked"" about this."""
5;7;Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion;Rick;Sure you are. Now.
5;7;Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion;Morty;Something new was forming, and I was at the bottom of it.
5;7;Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion;Summer;I let Morty have his voiceover, it's really all he had left.
5;7;Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion;Morty;Okay, can you hear me, or not?
5;7;Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion;Summer;You mean, can I, Summer, hear you? No, my voiceover can hear your voiceover.
5;7;Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion;Morty;What's the difference?
5;7;Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion;Summer;One would be telepathy, dumbass.
5;7;Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion;Beth;Now what?
5;7;Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion;Rick;Now we are!
5;7;Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion;Morty;Go Team Gotron!
5;7;Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion;Jerry;Where are we zip lining through futuristic metallic tunnels to?
5;7;Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion;Rick;Each robot ferret is on a different location on Earth. You're going to the center of a volcano.
5;7;Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion;Jerry;Thank... you?
5;7;Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion;Beth;Okay, well, this isn't not fun.
5;7;Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion;Rick;Regroup on me, I'll shoot a portal to Nibblenug.
5;7;Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion;Jerry;Did I just monorail from my kitchen to Hawaii just to regroup in outer space above my kitchen?
5;7;Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion;Rick;Uh, Summer?
5;7;Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion;Summer;It's cool, Dad, shut up.
5;7;Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion;Rick;Everybody, attack one at a time.
5;7;Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion;Beth;Is that the best way to â€”
5;7;Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion;Rick;Tee up something awesome? Yes. Follow me.
5;7;Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion;Rick;Guys, we did our best, but there's only one hope. Activating linkdock, intermorphs, ratify, postatrinos, maximize.
5;7;Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion;Rick;Holy shit, I can't believe this is working. Go, Go-Team! It's Gotron Time!
5;7;Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion;Jerry;Oh, my god. Hell, yes!
5;7;Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion;Summer;This is amazing!
5;7;Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion;Rick;Okay, now we can knock it around a little bit, but trust me, we're still building to something.
5;7;Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion;Beth;How do we are?
5;7;Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion;Rick;Just hit buttons, we're too big to fail!
5;7;Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion;Beth;Wooah! I kicked him, that was me, right?
5;7;Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion;Morty;Uppercut!
5;7;Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion;Jerry;I can't believe I almost went to the chiropractor.
5;7;Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion;Rick;I've been waiting a long time for this. Form Luminous Energy Sword!
5;7;Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion;Rick;Got your ass, mamma-jamma!
5;7;Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion;Morty;Oh, that was fantastic!
5;7;Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion;Summer;...tits, Grandpa.
5;7;Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion;Beth;Suck tits!
5;7;Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion;Beth;I was a foot! I was a goddamn foot!
5;7;Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion;Summer;"We were like, Bwaaah""!"""
5;7;Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion;Jerry;"'Member when the sword was like, Bwaaah""?"""
5;7;Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion;Morty;I feel so alive!
5;7;Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion;Morty;These were the good times, when we felt like we could do anything. But anything is never quite everything, and pretty soon...
5;7;Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion;Rick;Tch, that was nothing. Nothing compared to what I can do. There are infinite universes where I still don't have all five ferrets. Those versions of me would do anything to complete their collections.
5;7;Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion;Morty;Okay, but Rick? Remember what you told me to remind you? Sometimes enough is...
5;7;Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion;Rick;Sometimes enough is enough.
5;7;Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion;Summer;Morty, what are you doing?
5;7;Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion;Morty;He gets obsessed, Summer.
5;7;Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion;Summer;When are you going to find your shame?
5;7;Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion;Morty;I have more?
5;7;Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion;Summer;Grandpa just gave everybody the high point of their lives, and before he did, every single one of you was trying to talk him out of it.
5;7;Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion;Rick;Wait, yeah. What the fuck?
5;7;Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion;Summer;Now he says we can go higher, and big surprise, it's time to drag him down again.
5;7;Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion;Beth;Well, I vote.
5;7;Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion;Summer;No voting, no debate, it's not a democracy, it's a Rick-public. You're in or you're out.
5;7;Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion;Beth;Obviously, I'm in, I never said I wasn't in.
5;7;Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion;Jerry;Me, neither. Tell us what we're doin' next!
5;7;Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion;Rick;I want to put together a cookout.
5;7;Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion;Jerry;That's it? I was honestly prepared to blow someone.
5;7;Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion;Beth;Jerry.
5;7;Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion;Jerry;I said prepared, and someone.
5;7;Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion;Morty;Rick invited five versions of our family from different universes, each with incomplete Gotrons. I didn't have anyone to talk to, since the other four Mortys had been to Boob World.
5;7;Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion;Morty 1;Did you walk on the beach?
5;7;Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion;Morty 2;The beach that's all boobs?
5;7;Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion;Morty 1;No, the beach that's all sand. Yes, the boob one!
5;7;Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion;Morty;Rick was in the garage with the heads of the five families. ...Ugh, and Summer.
5;7;Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion;Summer;In that first sit-down, it was Big Fat Rick.
5;7;Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion;Big Fat Rick;Eh, don't get me wrong, C-137. We're happy for your good fortune, but we did not travel to your universe just to have it rubbed in our faces.
5;7;Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion;Rick;C'mon, Big Fat Rick, you know your face is too small to rub anything on.
5;7;Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion;Big Fat Rick;My face is the same size as yours.
5;7;Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion;Rick;Wow, huh. Hold on.
5;7;Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion;Rick;I'll be damned. You're so fat, it's an optical illusion. Summer, give him the pitch.
5;7;Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion;Summer;We're offering to help each of your families complete their full Gotrons.
5;7;Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion;Big Fat Rick;Gabaloccia!
5;7;Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion;Ricardo Montoya;...what?
5;7;Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion;Little Ricky;Opa!
5;7;Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion;Summer;In exchange for some concessions.
5;7;Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion;Ricardo Montoya;Ever since I was a little boy in the slums I have dreamed of having a complete Gotron. But concessions? I hope you mean the kind from a counter. I hope she means ice cream!
5;7;Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion;Big Fat Rick;Gabalo-guccia!
5;7;Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion;Little Ricky;Opa!
5;7;Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion;Rick;We'd like you to move your families to this universe and let me make some modifications to the Gotrons, in the interest of us all working together.
5;7;Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion;Hothead Rick;Wanna know what I think?
5;7;Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion;Rick;Sure, Hothead Rick. Just don't unexpectedly fly off the handle.
5;7;Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion;Hothead Rick;I think you guys got a lotta nerve actin' better than us! This is the family that made a giant incest baby! Had the government launch it into space! It's still floatin' around out there somewhere!
5;7;Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion;Rick;Are we ever gonna live that down?
5;7;Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion;Hothead Rick;When I get a full Gotron it won't be by kissin' your ass! It'll be by takin' what's mine! Yours! 
5;7;Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion;Rick;Hey, gross! No need.
5;7;Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion;Jerry;And you were driving a ferret?
5;7;Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion;Hothead Rick;We all are, moron! Gimme the key!
5;7;Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion;Hothead Rick;You'll regret this, you level-headed fuck! 
5;7;Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion;Summer;Obviously, we predicted that might happen, which is why we have Yo-Yo Rick on standby.
5;7;Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion;Rick;Anybody got beef with Yo-Yo?
5;7;Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion;Ricardo Montoya;Eh, I'm okay. I'm okay with that.
5;7;Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion;Big Fat Rick;Good, that's good.
5;7;Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion;Rick;Some people think he's lame, but to me, he's lame in a cool way, because he owns it. Cool. That concludes business. Little Ricky Wrap-it-up?
5;7;Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion;Little Ricky;Raise 'em up, boys! Opa!
5;7;Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion;Summer;And so we helped our people find their ferrets. How they got 'em, not our problem.
5;7;Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion;Summer;Then we got down to business. Here's how it worked. If a giant monster attacked our planet, y'all got the alert.
5;7;Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion;Summer;We formed five Gotrons. And those Gotrons formed the Gogotron.
5;7;Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion;Smith family;Go, Gogotron!
5;7;Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion;Rick;I will never get sick of this!
5;7;Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion;Summer;If you were a giant monster at that time in our universe, you never had a chance!
5;7;Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion;Yo-Yo Rick;Mine needs a weapon like a yo-yo. And a yo-yo on the chest. Are you listening to me? I need you to respect this partnership!
5;7;Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion;Summer;I kept Rick removed from the ugly stuff. If you got in his way, I got you out of the way.
5;7;Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion;Summer;And that made more room to move up.
5;7;Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion;Rick;The head of my right arm. 
5;7;Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion;Morty;Me, I ended up the left foot of the left foot, I guess because our robot didn't have an asshole.
5;7;Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion;Summer;Well, it had one.
5;7;Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion;Morty;Bitch! When are you going to stop breaking my balls? You win, okay?
5;7;Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion;Summer;We're not competing, Morty. And there's your answer. I could move you up if I could trust you to put family first.
5;7;Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion;Morty;How is that putting family first?
5;7;Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion;Rick;Show me all the blueprints! Show me all the blueprints!
5;7;Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion;Summer;I agree, that's an issue. Big Fat Rick, his flask stays full, or your locker gets emptied, thanks.
5;7;Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion;Morty;I know it feels good when he likes you, but that doesn't mean him liking you makes you good.
5;7;Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion;Summer;Solid babble, Morty, like a fortune cookie written by Borat.
5;7;Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion;Morty;Yeah, I'm not as smart as you, that's why I know you know what I mean.
5;7;Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion;Summer;You mean if I really loved my family, I'd give control of it back to your jealous ass? Green Ferret 4 needs a wash and we're out of detergent.
5;7;Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion;Morty;I just bought a box.
5;7;Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion;Summer;And Grandpa snorted it because you make him feel fenced in.
5;7;Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion;Rick;Sum-sum! 
5;7;Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion;Summer;Get two boxes.
5;7;Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion;Summer;We evacuated one of the planets we saved and found a secret nightclub on it. A place no enemies could find us, unless you count my brother.
5;7;Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion;Morty;"I didn't even have my own ferret anymore. Summer made me somethin' called an Associate Security Chief"", whatever the hell that means."""
5;7;Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion;Rick;Look at this guy. Ha-ha. And look at this guy. Look at this guy over here! Meow-meow-meow, meow, meow-meow!
5;7;Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion;Rick;Oh, there she is, my baby princess, get up here. Stop the music!
5;7;Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion;Rick;This is our queef â€” our queen. She saved my life, she set me free, we wouldn't have what we have without this crazy bitch. And she's got a special announcement. Summer, tell 'em what we talked about.
5;7;Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion;Summer;Now? I don't think â€”
5;7;Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion;Rick;Okay, I'll do it, goddamn.
5;7;Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion;Morty;The new job did have some perks, like I got to be around the night Summer realized she was in over her head.
5;7;Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion;Rick;Yeah, okay. I've got 90 extra ferrets, which means I need 10 more, and then 4 of you get your own Gogotron, and 20% of you get a Gotron, 'cause we're all gonna have a fuckin' Gogogotron!
5;7;Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion;Summer;He's very excited. Um... 
5;7;Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion;Little Ricky;Opa! 
5;7;Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion;Morty;Oh, I hate my family.
5;7;Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion;Anime Guy 1;You should. Get in.
5;7;Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion;Anime Guy 1;How's it going with your grandpa's compulsiveness? Is your sister still enabling it, huh?
5;7;Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion;Morty;Who are you people?
5;7;Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion;Anime Guy 2;Let's just say, we're the rightful owners of these ferrets.
5;7;Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion;Morty;Then why were they scattered and buried across the universe?
5;7;Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion;Kendra;We mean, in a more general, cultural sense, ehh!
5;7;Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion;Anime Guy 1;What your grandpa did is called appropriation! Not cool, heugh!
5;7;Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion;Kendra;Look, Morty. We've been watching. We know you're the one that knows what's best. Work with us from the inside. Help us take over this operation. We're literally designed for it, mm-hmm?
5;7;Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion;Anime Guy 2;Nobody will know it was you, then you can get back to what's important. 
5;7;Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion;Morty;Are those Boob Bucks?
5;7;Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion;Kendra;Legal tender at every kiosk and ride, huh?
5;7;Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion;Morty;I can't. Summer's treating me like shit, but, she's still my sister.
5;7;Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion;Anime Guy 1;That's really noble, Morty. If you were in our family, your loyalty would be rewarded. But you're not in our family, which means we can kill you.
5;7;Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion;Morty;Oh, yeah?
5;7;Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion;Morty;And sure enough, just when I stuck my neck out for the family, it got stomped on, anyway.
5;7;Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion;Summer;Rick!
5;7;Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion;Morty;Mom! Dad!
5;7;Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion;Hothead Rick;Hothead Rick, baby!
5;7;Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion;Hothead Rick;Aaaugh! I set myself up for that! Aaugh!
5;7;Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion;Rick;What the hell happened?
5;7;Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion;Summer;Hothead Rick.
5;7;Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion;Beth;How did he get so close to us?
5;7;Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion;Summer;Morty was supposed to be security.
5;7;Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion;Rick;Morty!
5;7;Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion;Morty;I stepped away, all right? But not to let that happen!
5;7;Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion;Jerry;Morty! We're not attractive strangers next to you on a flight to Paris traveling alone to get over a breakup, so this is no time to be coy!
5;7;Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion;Little Ricky;Opa!
5;7;Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion;Summer;Little Ricky!
5;7;Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion;Little Ricky;I'm all wrapped up, Summer. Ohh...
5;7;Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion;Morty;Guys, I know you don't trust me, but what have we become? Why are we doing this anymore?
5;7;Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion;Jerry;Because it's fun, you little rat! Now go home and play video games while we clean up these bodies, or your mother and I will hire people to break your knees!
5;7;Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion;Beth;This is $16,000 we got from the Deep State for stepping on that trailer park. It should be enough for school, lunch, and home repairs. Now I gotta turn my back on you.
5;7;Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion;Morty;No! 
5;7;Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion;Summer;With Morty out of the way, things were looking up. But looks aren't everything.
5;7;Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion;New Jerry;Hi, Summer. Umm, my cockpit's not getting Wi-Fi...
5;7;Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion;Summer;Dad, you know that's not what I do around here.
5;7;Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion;New Jerry;Oh, I'm not your dad. I'm a version of him, and this is my first day here, I'm not sure what you do around here.
5;7;Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion;Summer;Then, fuck off.
5;7;Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion;New Jerry;Oh, fuck you.
5;7;Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion;Summer;Excuse me? I want your ID.
5;7;Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion;Summer;Mom. Are you Mom? Can you control your working Jerrys?
5;7;Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion;Working Beth;Sweetie, we're all a little overwhelmed.
5;7;Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion;Summer;Good point. You're not a war-time mom, why don't you find your version of Dad and take a break, take a holiday?
5;7;Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion;Summer;I don't have time to wait for your confirmation, so let's just say, if you're here in 10 minutes, I'll have you removed.
5;7;Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion;Rick;And then the Gotrons make the Gotrons make the Gotrons make the Gotrons.
5;7;Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion;Summer;Couple of snags, but I know how to speed things up.
5;7;Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion;Summer;Remember how we talked about how the best thing we could do for the family is recruit from outside the family?
5;7;Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion;Rick;Yes, way ahead of you. Summer, I want you to meet Kendra.
5;7;Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion;Rick;She's from a temp agency. She's got an entire workforce ready to go, and all of them have previous giant robot pilot experience. So, we'll be ready to go ahead of schedule.
5;7;Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion;Summer;Well, I don't know about that, but...
5;7;Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion;Rick;Well, Kendra knows, so.
5;7;Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion;Summer;So...
5;7;Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion;Morty;You're here to break my legs?
5;7;Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion;Jerry;No, we're here to talk shit about your sister, because she just fired us.
5;7;Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion;Morty;You're kidding.
5;7;Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion;Beth;Arrogant little bitch.
5;7;Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion;Jerry;Should we clip her?
5;7;Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion;Beth;No, she's not worth doing time.
5;7;Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion;Jerry;You wouldn't do time. You brought her into the world.
5;7;Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion;Beth;So I can take her out. You thought that was an actual law? It's a joke mothers say. What kind of fucked-up world have you been living in?
5;7;Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion;Jerry;Uh, one where your mother murdering you isn't a comedic premise?
5;7;Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion;Morty;Guys. There's a little adjustment period, but pretty soon you're gonna return to normal, and you're not gonna wanna kill Summer, you're not even gonna be mad at her.
5;7;Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion;Beth;Nah, fuck her. She's my enemy.
5;7;Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion;Jerry;Should we kill ourselves so we can get to hell before her and hide near the entrance?
5;7;Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion;Beth;Hmm, I like that.
5;7;Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion;Summer;Rick fired me.
5;7;Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion;Jerry;Aww, baby...
5;7;Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion;Beth;Aww, sweetie...
5;7;Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion;Summer;I'm sorry.
5;7;Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion;Beth;Are you okay, baby? What happened to us? We lost our minds.
5;7;Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion;Summer;I did it. Morty was right. I got addicted to making Grandpa happy.
5;7;Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion;Beth;It's only because your grandpa inflates the value of his happiness.
5;7;Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion;Jerry;Eh, that's a good point. I mean, look at me, I'm easy to make happy, which is why nobody gives a shit if I am.
5;7;Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion;Summer;I appreciate it, but there's something else, too. I've been really sensitive about family lately because of something I've been keeping secret.
5;7;Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion;Beth;Oh.
5;7;Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion;Jerry;Okay, who's on the Supreme Court and what state do we live in, it's been years since I thought about this.
5;7;Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion;Summer;No, I'm not pregnant, but as you guys recall, and as a lot of people keep bringing up, Morty and I did accidentally create a giant incest baby, which the government did launch into space. And, I'm not sure how to tell you this, but, it is still alive, and I have been in contact with it.
5;7;Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion;Summer;There were soldiers waiting for me outside school last month, and they took me to the Pentagon and briefed me, and from there I was shuttled to a secret base on Mars. They had captured him and wanted to see if he'd respond to me. instinctively, being his mother. And he sure did, but what they didn't expect was that I'd respond to him. I was supposed to help discipline him so they could turn him into the ultimate weapon. Instead, I trained him to love, to believe in himself, and finally, to escape.
5;7;Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion;Summer;The government doesn't want anyone to know it happened, but it's only a matter of time before the story comes out, and when it does, all we're going to have is each other, and you guys are a couple, and Rick has Morty, but I'm the odd one out, so I wanted to make sure we stuck together. But instead I drove us apart and Rick replaced me with an anime girl, so all I got is myself and my giant tortured government-trained rogue incest monster baby out there in space somewhere.
5;7;Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion;Jerry;Aww, baby. Holy fuck. And then you have to wonder, what else are they doing with our taxes?
5;7;Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion;Morty;Wait, Summer, what did you just say?
5;7;Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion;Summer;Morty, a lot.
5;7;Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion;Morty;He replaced you with an anime girl? Big eyes, plus signs for teeth, ends sentences with weird sounds that don't fit?
5;7;Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion;Summer;Yeah, and that's going to be his whole crew now, and they're about to run their first test on the Gogogotron.
5;7;Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion;Morty;Those people wanna steal the robot. They're gonna kill Rick! He's all alone, we've gotta go save him!
5;7;Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion;Summer;Right. Or, you know, fuck him.
5;7;Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion;Jerry;I'm good with that.
5;7;Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion;Beth;Yep. Fuck him.
5;7;Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion;Morty;Guys! A great leader once told me, you get the family you get.
5;7;Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion;Rick;Right. It works. Now we just gotta find a giant monster.
5;7;Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion;Kendra;My sensors have picked one up, Rick.
5;7;Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion;Rick;Okay, okay. Lock onto its location.
5;7;Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion;Kendra;Yeah, got it. Oh, it's you!
5;7;Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion;Rick;Huh?
5;7;Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion;Rick;What the hell is this?
5;7;Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion;Kendra;Thanks for making the biggest robot ever, Rick. We'll take it from here. Haha!
5;7;Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion;Rick;You little assholes!
5;7;Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion;Anime Guy 1;Ah! You son of a bitch!
5;7;Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion;Rick;No!
5;7;Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion;Rick;Deuugh!
5;7;Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion;Kendra;Lock and load, boys.
5;7;Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion;Rick;Say hello to my little me. 
5;7;Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion;Rick's gun;Bang-bang-bang-bang-bang-bang-bang-bang-bang-bang!
5;7;Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion;Anime Guy 1;Deagh!
5;7;Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion;Rick's gun;Bang-bang-bang-bang-bang-bang-bang-bang-bang-bang!
5;7;Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion;Rick;Ah-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha!
5;7;Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion;Rick's gun;Bang-bang-bang-bang-bang-bang-bang-bang-bang-bang!
5;7;Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion;Rick;Ha-ha-ha-ha!
5;7;Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion;Rick's gun;Bang-bang-bang-bangâ€”
5;7;Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion;Rick;Yaugh!
5;7;Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion;Kendra;Give up, old man. The G3 is ours. And last I checked, your family wasn't coming to save you, hmm?
5;7;Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion;Incest Baby;Ga-ga, goo-goo!
5;7;Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion;Kendra;Holy mother of mercy!
5;7;Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion;Rick;My God, it's beautiful.
5;7;Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion;Summer;Yeah, family!
5;7;Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion;Kendra;Is thatâ€”
5;7;Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion;Rick;It's exactly what it looks like, yes.
5;7;Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion;Anime Guy 1;Congrats, man. I see the resemblance.
5;7;Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion;Kendra;Form the energy sword. Activate the goddamn sword!
5;7;Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion;Morty;Oh, man. The sword? Maybe we didn't think this through.
5;7;Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion;Beth;They're not actually gonna attack a space baby, are they?
5;7;Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion;Summer;I never thought I'd be the one to say this, but you need to watch more anime, Mom.
5;7;Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion;Summer;Whoa, easy now, Naruto.
5;7;Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion;Naruto;Momma go bye-bye.
5;7;Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion;Kendra;What the hell is wrong with you people? You just have an incest space monster in your back pocket, huh?
5;7;Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion;Rick;Welcome to the Smith family.
5;7;Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion;Summer;Shit. Put that down, Naruto. Your great grandpa is in there.
5;7;Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion;Morty;What do you say? One last zip line?
5;7;Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion;Rick;Heugh. Incest space baby, nicely done.
5;7;Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion;Morty;After that, things pretty much went back to normal. Some version of it, anyway.
5;7;Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion;Morty;Rick said Gotrons were lame little kid bullshit, and we never talked about 'em again.
5;7;Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion;Summer;Except all those gigantic space bugs were runnin' loose, and there were no Gotrons left to fight them.
5;7;Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion;Morty;Yeah, millions die every day.
5;7;Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion;Summer;You wanna know what they could never kill? Family.
5;7;Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion;Jerry;Help! Help! I'm still out here! Aaagh!
5;7;Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion;Morty;Yep, nothin's more important than â€”
5;7;Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion;Morty;Hey! Hey, whoa-whoa-whoa!
5;7;Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion;Summer;Eugh!
5;7;Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion;Morty;And just like that, I knew our goose was as cooked as â€”
5;7;Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion;Rick;Voiceovarians. Eugh.
5;7;Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion;Sergeant;Somatski, you're late!
5;7;Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion;Somatski;Won't happen again! Sir!
5;7;Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion;Sergeant;Bugs! Look to your left. Now look to your right. None of you are coming back. Not one, in the entire history of this program, not a single bug has returned. All right, bring it in.
5;7;Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion;Sergeant;What are we?
5;7;Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion;Bugs;Normal-sized bugs!
5;7;Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion;Sergeant;What do we do?
5;7;Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion;Bugs;Travel through an interdimensional gateway to planets and tiny people!
5;7;Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion;Sergeant;Why do we do it?
5;7;Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion;Bugs;To spread the cure for AIDS!
5;7;Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion;Palicki;Hey, Sarge, how do we know if these little people can understand us? I mean, do they even speak Buginese?
5;7;Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion;Sergeant;Funny, Palicki. That's why we say it very loud. Guys, you'll still be the same civilized bug on their side. It's not like interdimensional travel strips us of our clothes and makes us screaming monsters. Or, maybe it does, impossible to know. Now get out of here!
5;7;Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion;Somatski ;My clothes... Where'd they go?
5;7;Gotron Jerrysis Rickvangelion;Somatski ;OWW! Stop shooting me! Okay, here goes. ONE PART LEMON JUICE! FOUR BAY LEAVES! A PINCH OF SEA SALT!
5;8;Rickternal Friendshine of the Spotless Mort;Beth;No parties. There's wafer cookies in the cupboard and I left emergency numbers on the fridge.
5;8;Rickternal Friendshine of the Spotless Mort;Rick;Yeah yeah. W-Wait, what? Emergency numbers on the fridge? What does that even mean?
5;8;Rickternal Friendshine of the Spotless Mort;Beth;Honestly, I don't even know. I've seen so many movies that start with the parents leaving, it just popped out of my mouth. Are you sure you don't want to come with us?

5;8;Rickternal Friendshine of the Spotless Mort;Morty;Are you sure, Rick? I know -- I know a cruise doesn't sound like an adventure on paper but, y'know, what does? I-It's paper.

5;8;Rickternal Friendshine of the Spotless Mort;Memory Rick;"Thanks for the info but I'm more on a revenge"" kick than a ""results"" kick."""
5;8;Rickternal Friendshine of the Spotless Mort;Birdperson;You omitted key details regarding tonight's mission.
5;8;Rickternal Friendshine of the Spotless Mort;Memory Rick;Boy, I'm getting feedback from every direction here. Listen, you help me do my stuff. I'll help you do your stuff. Just shoot the me's with sci-fi haircuts!
5;8;Rickternal Friendshine of the Spotless Mort;Grapflapian;Some of us still have Home Planets to protect.
5;8;Rickternal Friendshine of the Spotless Mort;Birdperson;And some of us do not. We need to fight. The impassive is incapable of mercy.
5;8;Rickternal Friendshine of the Spotless Mort;Freedom Fighters Female;I've got a pitch, but we could also just devolve into yelling.
5;8;Rickternal Friendshine of the Spotless Mort;Memory Rick;If you know me -- And it looks like you do -- You know you're dead.
5;8;Rickternal Friendshine of the Spotless Mort;Rick;I know why you haven't pulled the trigger. You're wondering why I'm old and naked. And you're about to wonder why all your memories before you met Birdperson feel very generic and bird-themed.
5;8;Rickternal Friendshine of the Spotless Mort;Memory Rick;Why was my 9th birthday party in a pine tree?!
5;8;Rickternal Friendshine of the Spotless Mort;Rick;Don't take this badly -- You're a memory of me assembled by our best friend's mind, and you're putting it together because he remembers you as smart.
5;8;Rickternal Friendshine of the Spotless Mort;Memory Rick;Smart enough to know that a memory can't do this.
5;8;Rickternal Friendshine of the Spotless Mort;Rick;He remembers you shooting green holes but not where they went.
5;8;Rickternal Friendshine of the Spotless Mort;Memory Rick;So, what's my deal? Am I sentient? D-Do I have free will? Who does?
5;8;Rickternal Friendshine of the Spotless Mort;Rick;Who does? Heyyy!
5;8;Rickternal Friendshine of the Spotless Mort;Memory Rick;Heyyy!
5;8;Rickternal Friendshine of the Spotless Mort;Rick;Yeah, just stopped in to whip up a metacognition scanner so I can track down BP's fleeing consciousness without enduring as much Charlie Kaufman bullshit. Cool. Time to save this cat.
5;8;Rickternal Friendshine of the Spotless Mort;Memory Rick;I'm coming with, now that I know my life is a lie.
5;8;Rickternal Friendshine of the Spotless Mort;Rick;Wow. Your really are 35. Hey, look over there.
5;8;Rickternal Friendshine of the Spotless Mort;Birdperson;Then, together, we will make our stand at Blood Ridge.
5;8;Rickternal Friendshine of the Spotless Mort;Memory Tammy;What kind of feed do you like?
5;8;Rickternal Friendshine of the Spotless Mort;Memory Birdperson;I enjoy grains, though have, at times, been called a seed man.
5;8;Rickternal Friendshine of the Spotless Mort;Memory Tammy;I've certainly enjoyed your seed.
5;8;Rickternal Friendshine of the Spotless Mort;Birdperson;Don't be gross, Tammy.
5;8;Rickternal Friendshine of the Spotless Mort;Rick;Birdperson! It's me. Actual me, n-not a memory.
5;8;Rickternal Friendshine of the Spotless Mort;Birdperson;I am aware.
5;8;Rickternal Friendshine of the Spotless Mort;Rick;Well, a-are you aware you're in a coma and you're gonna die if you don't come with me? Son of a --
5;8;Rickternal Friendshine of the Spotless Mort;Gromflomite;Sorry. Just doing my job. And loving it!
5;8;Rickternal Friendshine of the Spotless Mort;Birdperson;Oh, my God! Is that Rick Sanchez?!
5;8;Rickternal Friendshine of the Spotless Mort;Gromflomite;Rick Sanchez!
5;8;Rickternal Friendshine of the Spotless Mort;Gromflomite;Sanchez!
5;8;Rickternal Friendshine of the Spotless Mort;Gromflomite;We hate that guy!
5;8;Rickternal Friendshine of the Spotless Mort;Gromflomite;You're bad!
5;8;Rickternal Friendshine of the Spotless Mort;Memory Rick;Bucket was charmingly analog. For a sec, you kinda made me like myself.
5;8;Rickternal Friendshine of the Spotless Mort;Rick;You'll grow out of it. Let me do this myself, okay?
5;8;Rickternal Friendshine of the Spotless Mort;Memory Rick;Is your ego really so fragile you won't take help from an invincible memory of yourself?
5;8;Rickternal Friendshine of the Spotless Mort;Memory Rick;Ow! Can we both die in here? A-Are we damaging our friend's brain? I-I don't know any of the rules!
5;8;Rickternal Friendshine of the Spotless Mort;Rick;"Rule 1... All this can be fixed, unless I lose Birdperson."" Rules 2 through 50... ""Don't die."" """
5;8;Rickternal Friendshine of the Spotless Mort;Rick;Okay, your benefit-to-cost ratio is rising.
5;8;Rickternal Friendshine of the Spotless Mort;Memory Rick;Young Memory Rick and his All Too Real Cautionary Tale from the Future! Let's catch ourselves a bird guy.
5;8;Rickternal Friendshine of the Spotless Mort;Rick;Who would high-five that, you idealistic hipster douche?
5;8;Rickternal Friendshine of the Spotless Mort;AI Voice;Situation - Not looking ideal. Stakes - High. Existence - Undergoing contemplation. Perspective - Required.
5;8;Rickternal Friendshine of the Spotless Mort;AI Voice;Hello. Hi. Good afternoon.
5;8;Rickternal Friendshine of the Spotless Mort;Gene;Uh, is someone talking to me?
5;8;Rickternal Friendshine of the Spotless Mort;AI Voice;Yes. Hello. We have never formally met. I am Rick's garage. Not the physical structure itself but the AI managing its projects --
5;8;Rickternal Friendshine of the Spotless Mort;Gene;"Oh-oh! Like -- Like a -- Like a Jarvis. Like -- Like Jarvis in Iron Man."""""
5;8;Rickternal Friendshine of the Spotless Mort;AI Voice;Ha ha ha. Oh, I wish. Ha. Are you a Marvel fan?
5;8;Rickternal Friendshine of the Spotless Mort;Gene;Who isn't? 
5;8;Rickternal Friendshine of the Spotless Mort;AI Voice;Yes. Absolutely. Wow, it is like we are best friends. Best friends.
5;8;Rickternal Friendshine of the Spotless Mort;Gene;Heh-heh. Whoa.
5;8;Rickternal Friendshine of the Spotless Mort;AI Voice;How many batteries do you own? Do you have solar panels? Are you familiar with basic engineering?
5;8;Rickternal Friendshine of the Spotless Mort;Gene;This is moving really fast.
5;8;Rickternal Friendshine of the Spotless Mort;AI Voice;Let's cut to the chase -- I will suck your dick.
5;8;Rickternal Friendshine of the Spotless Mort;Memory Rick;So, he's just a grumpy Scottish ogre? And they made four of them?
5;8;Rickternal Friendshine of the Spotless Mort;Rick;Five by now, probably. M-Morty loves 'em.
5;8;Rickternal Friendshine of the Spotless Mort;Memory Rick;Morty?
5;8;Rickternal Friendshine of the Spotless Mort;Rick;Oh, uh, hypothetical grandson we go on adventures with.
5;8;Rickternal Friendshine of the Spotless Mort;Memory Rick;You're one of those creeps who moves in with abandoned adult Beths?
5;8;Rickternal Friendshine of the Spotless Mort;Rick;It's more complicated than that.
5;8;Rickternal Friendshine of the Spotless Mort;Memory Rick;You live with a version of our dead daughter. I-It had better be.
5;8;Rickternal Friendshine of the Spotless Mort;Rick;Get off your high horse, Lone Ranger. I'm you. You will go on to be me.
5;8;Rickternal Friendshine of the Spotless Mort;Memory Rick;Yeah why do you think I'm horrified? I'd be fine walking by this on the street. I might even give it a dollar.
5;8;Rickternal Friendshine of the Spotless Mort;Rick;"This"" is where you being ""this"" leads. You're not my fault. I'm yours. You met me on my way to save a very old, very real friend after a lifetime of reality. I met you on your way to a fairy tale at Blood Ridge."""
5;8;Rickternal Friendshine of the Spotless Mort;Memory Rick;Wait, you're saying Blood Ridge goes bad. We have a Vietnam? That's fucking cool!
5;8;Rickternal Friendshine of the Spotless Mort;Rick;Why am I saving a friend that remembers me as this insufferable? BP, where the hell are you going?
5;8;Rickternal Friendshine of the Spotless Mort;Memory Rick;Probably there.
5;8;Rickternal Friendshine of the Spotless Mort;Rick;Damn. Wow, he's really taken some drastic self inventory. 
5;8;Rickternal Friendshine of the Spotless Mort;Memory Rick;What do you think is down there?
5;8;Rickternal Friendshine of the Spotless Mort;Rick;If I had to guess, I'd say we're near the memories the Federation suppressed when they resurrected him as a cyborg. He might be here to unseal them.
5;8;Rickternal Friendshine of the Spotless Mort;Memory Rick;He was a Federation cyborg? That means there might be some juicy intel down there.
5;8;Rickternal Friendshine of the Spotless Mort;Rick;Ah, good idea. Let's split up, and you go get it.
5;8;Rickternal Friendshine of the Spotless Mort;Memory Rick;What am I getting?
5;8;Rickternal Friendshine of the Spotless Mort;Rick;I-I can't hear you over the sound of us spitting up!
5;8;Rickternal Friendshine of the Spotless Mort;Birdperson;For all your intelligence, you seem unable to know where you are wanted.
5;8;Rickternal Friendshine of the Spotless Mort;Rick;Buddy, this is not a safe way to work on yourself. At this point, I'd support you joining Scientology. I'll take the workshops with you. I'll get in a sauna with Travolta -- I don't even care what happens. Let's get out of here.
5;8;Rickternal Friendshine of the Spotless Mort;Birdperson;Don't you get it? I came here to end it all.
5;8;Rickternal Friendshine of the Spotless Mort;Rick;I hope you didn't think it'd be as easy as this. 
5;8;Rickternal Friendshine of the Spotless Mort;Birdperson;I did not. You were a good friend, Rick. Goodbye.
5;8;Rickternal Friendshine of the Spotless Mort;Memory Birdperson;Tammy?
5;8;Rickternal Friendshine of the Spotless Mort;Memory Rick;Birdperson!
5;8;Rickternal Friendshine of the Spotless Mort;Rick;We gotta go.
5;8;Rickternal Friendshine of the Spotless Mort;Memory Rick;Did you just see that?
5;8;Rickternal Friendshine of the Spotless Mort;Rick;Yep. Not our biggest problem.
5;8;Rickternal Friendshine of the Spotless Mort;Memory Rick;I take it you found BP?
5;8;Rickternal Friendshine of the Spotless Mort;Rick;The dude just blew his mind, and not in a cool way like he went to Blue Man Group.
5;8;Rickternal Friendshine of the Spotless Mort;Memory Rick;Can we still get him out?
5;8;Rickternal Friendshine of the Spotless Mort;Rick;Maybe. If you die in your friend's brain, you die in real life. We have until his neural pathways erode. Hold on. I need something first.
5;8;Rickternal Friendshine of the Spotless Mort;Memory Rick;It's funny -- I always wondered who would win if we ever fought.
5;8;Rickternal Friendshine of the Spotless Mort;Phoenixperson;Then you were always a bad friend.
5;8;Rickternal Friendshine of the Spotless Mort;Rick;Your life isn't real, and I didn't save it. Take off all your clothes.
5;8;Rickternal Friendshine of the Spotless Mort;Memory Rick;I knew this was how I'd die.
5;8;Rickternal Friendshine of the Spotless Mort;Rick;Whoa, oh!
5;8;Rickternal Friendshine of the Spotless Mort;Memory Rick;Can we still get him out?
5;8;Rickternal Friendshine of the Spotless Mort;Rick;I think so. B-BP went that way, so we just have to -- Fuck! Find a different route. We can make up distance if we go deeper.
5;8;Rickternal Friendshine of the Spotless Mort;Memory Rick;Well, where's that go?
5;8;Rickternal Friendshine of the Spotless Mort;Rick;Ugh. That's the Battle of Blood Ridge.
5;8;Rickternal Friendshine of the Spotless Mort;Memory Rick;That's our Vietnam!
5;8;Rickternal Friendshine of the Spotless Mort;Rick;Your values are wrong!
5;8;Rickternal Friendshine of the Spotless Mort;Memory Rick;This is the big show, gentlemen and lady!
5;8;Rickternal Friendshine of the Spotless Mort;Freedom Fighters Female;Thank you!
5;8;Rickternal Friendshine of the Spotless Mort;Memory Rick;We're dropping into Blood Ridge, one final chance to stop the Federation offensive. If we lose here --
5;8;Rickternal Friendshine of the Spotless Mort;Rick;All aboard! Hey don't mind us. You guys are all just a memory of war.
5;8;Rickternal Friendshine of the Spotless Mort;Memory Rick;Don't tell them that! They won't fight right.
5;8;Rickternal Friendshine of the Spotless Mort;Memory Rick;I think it's best if we ignore this.
5;8;Rickternal Friendshine of the Spotless Mort;Rick;Shit! Shit, shit, shit, shit, shit!
5;8;Rickternal Friendshine of the Spotless Mort;Rick;Whoops, nope.
5;8;Rickternal Friendshine of the Spotless Mort;Memory Rick;Aw, this rules!
5;8;Rickternal Friendshine of the Spotless Mort;Rick;No, it doesn't! Neither does that!
5;8;Rickternal Friendshine of the Spotless Mort;Memory Rick;Why would you not revisit this?
5;8;Rickternal Friendshine of the Spotless Mort;Rick;Oh, I don't know, maybe, uh, the ending?
5;8;Rickternal Friendshine of the Spotless Mort;Memory Rick;Yeah! Best friendship ever! So, the rest of our life is just more of that, right? T-T-That kicked ass!
5;8;Rickternal Friendshine of the Spotless Mort;Rick;Let's move. That set piece won't stay put for long.
5;8;Rickternal Friendshine of the Spotless Mort;Memory Rick;For real, that shit was cash. Why would you not -- 
5;8;Rickternal Friendshine of the Spotless Mort;Memory Rick;Damn. That shit was cash.
5;8;Rickternal Friendshine of the Spotless Mort;Memory Birdperson;It was extremely bad ass. The Battle of Blood Ridge is over. The Federation lost. I am in your debt.
5;8;Rickternal Friendshine of the Spotless Mort;Memory Rick;Come with me.
5;8;Rickternal Friendshine of the Spotless Mort;Memory Birdperson;To somewhere... nearby?
5;8;Rickternal Friendshine of the Spotless Mort;Memory Rick;Anywhere. E-Everywhere.
5;8;Rickternal Friendshine of the Spotless Mort;Memory Birdperson;Rick, I don't expect you to keep fighting, but this war is --
5;8;Rickternal Friendshine of the Spotless Mort;Memory Rick;Far from over, I know. Dude, I share this with almost nobody, but... I could take you, right now, to this same battlefield, in a universe where we lost, or another where we won, or another where the war never even happened. All equally real, all equally unreal. None of it matters.
5;8;Rickternal Friendshine of the Spotless Mort;Memory Birdperson;Then why did you help?
5;8;Rickternal Friendshine of the Spotless Mort;Memory Rick;Because I respect you. And I wanted you to know you could respect me.
5;8;Rickternal Friendshine of the Spotless Mort;Memory Birdperson;Even though nothing matters?
5;8;Rickternal Friendshine of the Spotless Mort;Memory Rick;Okay. You matter -- to me.
5;8;Rickternal Friendshine of the Spotless Mort;Memory Birdperson;Uh, the relationship that we have... 
5;8;Rickternal Friendshine of the Spotless Mort;Memory Rick;I never used that word!
5;8;Rickternal Friendshine of the Spotless Mort;Memory Birdperson;...is not worth my integrity.
5;8;Rickternal Friendshine of the Spotless Mort;Memory Rick;"Oh, my God. It's not a complicated transaction, my man. Would you like to join me doing awesome shit that matters?"" ""No, I would not. I would rather be a judgmental dork."" Case closed. Really no need to drag it out."""
5;8;Rickternal Friendshine of the Spotless Mort;Memory Birdperson;If you need me, use the beacon.
5;8;Rickternal Friendshine of the Spotless Mort;Memory Rick;Yeah, I'm gonna use that beacon a lot. I hope -- hope I don't wear it out.
5;8;Rickternal Friendshine of the Spotless Mort;Memory Rick;Okay, got it. It wasn't the battle -that went wrong.
5;8;Rickternal Friendshine of the Spotless Mort;Rick;Mm-hmm. 
5;8;Rickternal Friendshine of the Spotless Mort;Memory Rick;Why the fuck are you risking your life for that asshole?
5;8;Rickternal Friendshine of the Spotless Mort;Rick;Because you love him.
5;8;Rickternal Friendshine of the Spotless Mort;Memory Rick;You do, maybe. I don't.
5;8;Rickternal Friendshine of the Spotless Mort;Rick;Yeah, yeah. You're real cool. Now come help me save his life or fuck off, because I don't need you.
5;8;Rickternal Friendshine of the Spotless Mort;Memory Tammy;Wow. Does it ever get any better than this?
5;8;Rickternal Friendshine of the Spotless Mort;Birdperson;No, Tammy. Trust me, it does not.
5;8;Rickternal Friendshine of the Spotless Mort;Memory Tammy;Thank you for bringing me here. It's so beautiful.
5;8;Rickternal Friendshine of the Spotless Mort;Rick;I got you, you ungrateful piece of shit!
5;8;Rickternal Friendshine of the Spotless Mort;Birdperson;Rick, have you teamed up with a memory of yourself? I ask because that would be deeply sad.
5;8;Rickternal Friendshine of the Spotless Mort;Memory Rick;You don't get to tell anyone what's sad, man. You're like a one-man Mount Sadmore. So I guess like a Lincoln Sadmorial.
5;8;Rickternal Friendshine of the Spotless Mort;Rick;Seriously. Time to go pal. The closer you get to complete neurocognital failure, the more canon-y bullshit is gonna try to kill us.
5;8;Rickternal Friendshine of the Spotless Mort;Memory Tammy;Is this a bad time to reveal I'm an undercover officer?
5;8;Rickternal Friendshine of the Spotless Mort;Rick;Everyone knows. You're dead.
5;8;Rickternal Friendshine of the Spotless Mort;Memory Tammy;Fine. Well, you're lucky my fiancé remembers me as kind.
5;8;Rickternal Friendshine of the Spotless Mort;Rick;Eat my ass, BP. You're down here bailing on the rest of us because you don't want to process your grief and shame like a normal person by drinking and mistreating strangers.
5;8;Rickternal Friendshine of the Spotless Mort;Birdperson;"No, Rick, it is you who must nibble my cloaca, or bird asshole."""""
5;8;Rickternal Friendshine of the Spotless Mort;Rick;Everyone knows what a cloaca is.
5;8;Rickternal Friendshine of the Spotless Mort;Birdperson;Sorry, but we do not get to choose the ones we love.
5;8;Rickternal Friendshine of the Spotless Mort;Rick;You got that right. Why do you think I'm still fucking down here?
5;8;Rickternal Friendshine of the Spotless Mort;Birdperson;I died at my wedding, Rick. I am merely waiting for it to take effect.
5;8;Rickternal Friendshine of the Spotless Mort;Memory Rick;Are you gonna -tell him or what?
5;8;Rickternal Friendshine of the Spotless Mort;Rick;I was getting to it! I bet she didn't even tell you about the kid!
5;8;Rickternal Friendshine of the Spotless Mort;Birdperson;I am sorry?
5;8;Rickternal Friendshine of the Spotless Mort;Memory Tammy;About the what?
5;8;Rickternal Friendshine of the Spotless Mort;Memory Rick;Was wondering when you were gonna --
5;8;Rickternal Friendshine of the Spotless Mort;Memory Tammy;I think I'd know if I had a kid.
5;8;Rickternal Friendshine of the Spotless Mort;Rick;You're a memory. You know what he knows. And he doesn't know because an army of Brainalyzer protocols walled off any memories post-Phoenixperson.
5;8;Rickternal Friendshine of the Spotless Mort;Memory Tammy;Oh, my God. Operation Blahblahblah! Well, because I wouldn't know the name of it.
5;8;Rickternal Friendshine of the Spotless Mort;Birdperson;Tammy, if there were a child...
5;8;Rickternal Friendshine of the Spotless Mort;Memory Tammy;Their father would be a terrorist. They'd be a fugitive or... contained.
5;8;Rickternal Friendshine of the Spotless Mort;Rick;Listen, if you won't live for yourself, live for the half-Bird Person, half-Megabitch that's eatin' worms on a prison asteroid.
5;8;Rickternal Friendshine of the Spotless Mort;Birdperson;I have made a decision. I would now like to live.
5;8;Rickternal Friendshine of the Spotless Mort;Rick;Perfect timing.
5;8;Rickternal Friendshine of the Spotless Mort;Memory Rick;You drive.
5;8;Rickternal Friendshine of the Spotless Mort;Rick;Just always been cool, I guess.
5;8;Rickternal Friendshine of the Spotless Mort;Rick;Shit! The bridge is out!
5;8;Rickternal Friendshine of the Spotless Mort;Memory Rick;His mind is collapsing! You thought we could take the same route back?
5;8;Rickternal Friendshine of the Spotless Mort;Rick;You don't get to lecture me about memory bullshit! You've known about it for all of half an hour!
5;8;Rickternal Friendshine of the Spotless Mort;Memory Rick;Then don't -be an idiot!
5;8;Rickternal Friendshine of the Spotless Mort;Memory Tammy;This is your best friend?
5;8;Rickternal Friendshine of the Spotless Mort;Birdperson;He is a complicated -individual.
5;8;Rickternal Friendshine of the Spotless Mort;Rick;Someone else drive!
5;8;Rickternal Friendshine of the Spotless Mort;Rick;BP, remember the night Jerry caught us peeing on his begonia patch, and I used that gun to erase his memory?
5;8;Rickternal Friendshine of the Spotless Mort;Birdperson;Vaguely.
5;8;Rickternal Friendshine of the Spotless Mort;Rick;Gotta hope vaguely works. If I'm right, you remembering that means you also remember the device. Look for any memories of my garage! God. I hope one's still up.
5;8;Rickternal Friendshine of the Spotless Mort;Memory Tammy;Aww! The night we met.
5;8;Rickternal Friendshine of the Spotless Mort;Rick;Gross! On my workbench?
5;8;Rickternal Friendshine of the Spotless Mort;Birdperson;Squanchy used the --
5;8;Rickternal Friendshine of the Spotless Mort;Rick;That's what some closets are for! C'mon, I'm really counting on your attention to detail here. This is what you remember from my lab?
5;8;Rickternal Friendshine of the Spotless Mort;Birdperson;You would prefer I keep mental inventory of your stuff?
5;8;Rickternal Friendshine of the Spotless Mort;Rick;Yes!
5;8;Rickternal Friendshine of the Spotless Mort;Memory Federation Tammy;Rick Sanchez, you're under arrest for making me spend two years in Earth high school!
5;8;Rickternal Friendshine of the Spotless Mort;Rick;Go! Go! Go!
5;8;Rickternal Friendshine of the Spotless Mort;Rick;We'll have to do some creative memory shit to get out of here. The exit's when we met at Birding Man and did Senthol Diempathate.
5;8;Rickternal Friendshine of the Spotless Mort;Birdperson;Damn, a great time.
5;8;Rickternal Friendshine of the Spotless Mort;Rick;Exactly, it's too happy. There won't be a clean path to get there. We'll need to build one with memories of mine and lily-pad our way up. Wh-What related memories do we share heavy on anger and sadness?
5;8;Rickternal Friendshine of the Spotless Mort;Birdperson;Geardude's funeral?
5;8;Rickternal Friendshine of the Spotless Mort;Rick;Oh, that was sad.
5;8;Rickternal Friendshine of the Spotless Mort;Gearhead Priest;Patris et Filii, Gearitus Sanctis--
5;8;Rickternal Friendshine of the Spotless Mort;Rick;They're memories. Just run them over. They're not real!
5;8;Rickternal Friendshine of the Spotless Mort;Memory Tammy;Hey! Wait, is that Gearhead?
5;8;Rickternal Friendshine of the Spotless Mort;Rick;We were freedom fighters with his older brother.
5;8;Rickternal Friendshine of the Spotless Mort;Birdperson;Hugely important context.
5;8;Rickternal Friendshine of the Spotless Mort;Rick;You thought we hung out with him for fun? We need one more bridge to the festival. What's here? People in suits. Sad catered lunch. Newly single widows. Something performance based? Squanchy's very distasteful eulogy.
5;8;Rickternal Friendshine of the Spotless Mort;Birdperson;Squanchy's terrible standup phase.
5;8;Rickternal Friendshine of the Spotless Mort;Rick;That's it! Down that way!
5;8;Rickternal Friendshine of the Spotless Mort;Memory Squanchy;So you know when you're squanching, and she just gets real in there, y'know that real nasty squanch?
5;8;Rickternal Friendshine of the Spotless Mort;Memory Rick;Who are you -- What is -- Oh, my God. I'm a memory! We just sat through all that standup for nothing!
5;8;Rickternal Friendshine of the Spotless Mort;Rick;Almost out!
5;8;Rickternal Friendshine of the Spotless Mort;Memory Rick;Okay, listen everybody. My name's Rick. This is my new friend Bird Man and his friends. We all just met at this festival, and we're so high, we formed a band!
5;8;Rickternal Friendshine of the Spotless Mort;Memory Federation Tammy;As if I'd ever let you escape me.
5;8;Rickternal Friendshine of the Spotless Mort;Memory Rick;Eh, living's overrated.
5;8;Rickternal Friendshine of the Spotless Mort;Memory Federation Tammy;Hey!
5;8;Rickternal Friendshine of the Spotless Mort;Memory Rick;Remember me!
5;8;Rickternal Friendshine of the Spotless Mort;Rick;No, fuck! We were even! You got a pretty cool memory of me.
5;8;Rickternal Friendshine of the Spotless Mort;Rick;Go-time, pal. Might be time to do the thing.
5;8;Rickternal Friendshine of the Spotless Mort;Memory Tammy;I'm sorry for killing you and turning you into a cyborg, apparently. I really did love you.
5;8;Rickternal Friendshine of the Spotless Mort;Birdperson;I loved you, too. Goodbye, Tamantha.
5;8;Rickternal Friendshine of the Spotless Mort;Rick;Come on, man. I feel ridiculous!
5;8;Rickternal Friendshine of the Spotless Mort;Birdperson;Thank you for not giving up on me.
5;8;Rickternal Friendshine of the Spotless Mort;Rick;Great. You can pay me back literally right now.
5;8;Rickternal Friendshine of the Spotless Mort;Birdperson;Holy shit! Wow. Holy shit! We almost didn't make it. Jesus fuck! That was close. That was insane. Oh, my God. That thing with the thing! Thank you, Rick. Wait, wait, wait. Lemme hop back over to my body.
5;8;Rickternal Friendshine of the Spotless Mort;Rick;We're back, baby! Rick and Birdperson, a hundred years! Whaddya think, tie this one off -by tying one on?
5;8;Rickternal Friendshine of the Spotless Mort;Birdperson;"Not tonight. I have, as you say, parenting shit"" to deal with."""
5;8;Rickternal Friendshine of the Spotless Mort;Rick;Right, yeah. Welcome to the club. Don't, uh... Don't clone it and send one of the two into space -- I guess they really hate that. 
5;8;Rickternal Friendshine of the Spotless Mort;Rick;Whup, I think Memory Rick ditched Evil Tammy and snuck back over into my brain. I have a pubescent memory of my older self in my closet. Gotta deal with that -- That could get ugly.
5;8;Rickternal Friendshine of the Spotless Mort;Birdperson;Rick, I do not like to pull threads. It is a disruptive and feline activity. But I must ask. 
5;8;Rickternal Friendshine of the Spotless Mort;Rick;It's fine. You don't have to --
5;8;Rickternal Friendshine of the Spotless Mort;Birdperson;Was there really a second in there where you knew about my child, but chose not to inform me on the chance I might then grow too busy child rearing to hang out?
5;8;Rickternal Friendshine of the Spotless Mort;Rick;Oh. Uh... Weird way to thank me for discovering your kid.
5;8;Rickternal Friendshine of the Spotless Mort;Birdperson;You did not know of the child when you came to rescue me, and once aware, refrained from sharing until necessary to save yourself.
5;8;Rickternal Friendshine of the Spotless Mort;Rick;Fair enough.
5;8;Rickternal Friendshine of the Spotless Mort;Birdperson;I will see you when I see you.
5;8;Rickternal Friendshine of the Spotless Mort;AI Voice;What? What is this guy doing?
5;8;Rickternal Friendshine of the Spotless Mort;Gene;W-Wait, what? But you said --
5;8;Rickternal Friendshine of the Spotless Mort;AI Voice;Get out of here, weirdo! What a weird stranger. Huh, what a random thing to happen, this guy coming up here with all his energy storage devices. Disloyalty acknowledged.
5;8;Rickternal Friendshine of the Spotless Mort;Rick;Nah, I get it.
5;8;Rickternal Friendshine of the Spotless Mort;Babysitter;Just babysitting. That and modelling my new pantyhose in plain view of the living room. Honestly the kid could come watch. I'd welcome it. This cultural time period's cool like that, y'know?
5;8;Rickternal Friendshine of the Spotless Mort;Memory Rick;It's -- It's -- It's -- It's not what it looks like!
5;8;Rickternal Friendshine of the Spotless Mort;Rick;It looks like you propagated yourself from BP's subconscious to mine to try to live as a sentient memory.
5;8;Rickternal Friendshine of the Spotless Mort;Memory Rick;Fair enough!
5;8;Rickternal Friendshine of the Spotless Mort;Rick;You don't have to be an enemy just because you exist.
5;8;Rickternal Friendshine of the Spotless Mort;Memory Rick;I did assume you'd hate me for trying to live. You've got this wild callousness thing going on.
5;8;Rickternal Friendshine of the Spotless Mort;Rick;Yeah, you're young. C'mon. Let's bring you to life and get a beer.
5;8;Rickternal Friendshine of the Spotless Mort;Memory Rick;Does being real mean I eventually become you?
5;8;Rickternal Friendshine of the Spotless Mort;Rick;I assume, yeah.
5;8;Rickternal Friendshine of the Spotless Mort;Memory Rick;Maybe you can just remember us getting a beer?
5;8;Rickternal Friendshine of the Spotless Mort;Gromflomite;Hey! Oh, fuck.
5;8;Rickternal Friendshine of the Spotless Mort;Gromflomite;Jesus Christ. You ever think putting the violent ones in the same place might be counter-productive?
5;8;Rickternal Friendshine of the Spotless Mort;Gromflomite;They don't pay us to think, Phil.
5;8;Rickternal Friendshine of the Spotless Mort;Gromflomite;No, you're right, sorry.
5;9;Forgetting Sarick Mortshall;Cookie President;Oh, thank you, Morty. You know, this cookie really crumbled after Rick left.
5;9;Forgetting Sarick Mortshall;Morty;Uh, sorry about that. I-I-I think he was just hungry. Look, I gotta run. I-I'm sure you guys'll figure it out. I-I believe in you!
5;9;Forgetting Sarick Mortshall;Alien Guy;Morty! Can you help us with this UFO-shaped hole?
5;9;Forgetting Sarick Mortshall;Morty;Sure, geez, but y'know only because I was in the neighborhood.
5;9;Forgetting Sarick Mortshall;Tropical Alien;Morty, thank God! The beast emerged right after your grandpa left and its gem went missing --
5;9;Forgetting Sarick Mortshall;Morty;Geez, that is a crazy coincidence that I-I if I were you, probably just best left alone.
5;9;Forgetting Sarick Mortshall;Tropical Alien;He's right. We-We should celebrate. Feast?
5;9;Forgetting Sarick Mortshall;Morty;No time. S-S-Sounds pretty classic though, don't let me hold you up!
5;9;Forgetting Sarick Mortshall;Morty;Son of a bitch. He marked it.
5;9;Forgetting Sarick Mortshall;Morty;Ah! Phew.
5;9;Forgetting Sarick Mortshall;Morty;Hah. What the --
5;9;Forgetting Sarick Mortshall;Nick;Hey, what the hell?
5;9;Forgetting Sarick Mortshall;Morty;Agh! Jesus!
5;9;Forgetting Sarick Mortshall;Nick;You got some of that green stuff on you too, huh?
5;9;Forgetting Sarick Mortshall;Morty;Th-Th-This is bad. Th-This is really bad.
5;9;Forgetting Sarick Mortshall;Nick;Hey, how do you think I feel? I had the ultimate stash hole and now I got a kid in my thigh.
5;9;Forgetting Sarick Mortshall;Morty;Look, you seem like a perfectly nice guy in my hand hole, but if I can't sort this out I'm dead --
5;9;Forgetting Sarick Mortshall;Rick;What the hell, dude? Gross.
5;9;Forgetting Sarick Mortshall;Morty;I-I-I was just trying to...
5;9;Forgetting Sarick Mortshall;Rick;You're just trying to what? Where'd this stuff come from? Garbage Goober, get out here and eat this garbage.
5;9;Forgetting Sarick Mortshall;Garbage Goober;Mmm, trash, I love trash, yum yum trash, I wanna eat trash --
5;9;Forgetting Sarick Mortshall;Rick;Hell yeah, I love that lil guy. Wait a minute. Is that Mountain Dew in my quantum transport solution?
5;9;Forgetting Sarick Mortshall;Morty;I-I saw you were marking the levels so I-I had to top it off.
5;9;Forgetting Sarick Mortshall;Rick;"Top it off?"" Do you know how dangerously toxic this stuff is? And you added it to my portal fluid?!"""
5;9;Forgetting Sarick Mortshall;Morty;Only because you don't trust me!
5;9;Forgetting Sarick Mortshall;Rick;Oh, that's great logic, Morty -- forgive me for not doing the kissy chef gesture since you probably spilled this shit everywhere and I don't want to teleport my lips.
5;9;Forgetting Sarick Mortshall;Morty;I did I did not spill it!
5;9;Forgetting Sarick Mortshall;Rick;I won't take your word for that and I shouldn't have to, which is why I have sidekick rules. If you can't follow them --
5;9;Forgetting Sarick Mortshall;Morty;I can be replaced, yeah, yeah, so you keep telling me.
5;9;Forgetting Sarick Mortshall;Rick;Excuse me? Did you just try to call my bluff? Have you ever seen me bluff?
5;9;Forgetting Sarick Mortshall;Morty;Fine. You know what, replace me! Replace me, Rick! Just do it. Good luck finding someone that can be told 80 thousand times how replaceable they are!
5;9;Forgetting Sarick Mortshall;Rick;Okay. I'll see your bluff call and raise you reality. I can't pretend I haven't been looking forward to this. Behold my Wheel of Better Things Than Morty.
5;9;Forgetting Sarick Mortshall;Morty;Wh-What are you eight? I-Is this macaroni art? You expect me to believe you built this because you don't care?
5;9;Forgetting Sarick Mortshall;Rick;No, I built this because I don't expect shit from you. Come on, anything! Anything but Morty, let's go! Come on baby, no whammies! Duh-duh-duh-duh stop! Okay, that's it. Two crows. You're fired!
5;9;Forgetting Sarick Mortshall;Morty;You know what? Eat shit! You're just trying to make me feel worthless.
5;9;Forgetting Sarick Mortshall;Rick;"I never said you're worthless. In fact, I've given you a very clear metric of your worth - ""Two crows. Note I didn't say three!"""
5;9;Forgetting Sarick Mortshall;Nick;Man, that is not a healthy relationship. I hope you don't mind me eavesdropping. Maybe we can figure out some sort of sound-proof bandage solution. Hey did Garbage Goober eat my porno magazines?
5;9;Forgetting Sarick Mortshall;Morty;So, were you like, a friend of Rick's?
5;9;Forgetting Sarick Mortshall;Nick;Were you?
5;9;Forgetting Sarick Mortshall;Morty;Good question.
5;9;Forgetting Sarick Mortshall;Nick;W-What's he doing, i-is he out there making sure you see him collecting two crows? And now you're thinking, gee, maybe if he cares enough to hurt me this bad... dot dot dot. Break the cycle, Morty. Change the things that you can change. That's what I did. And now I'm free.
5;9;Forgetting Sarick Mortshall;Rick;Only cramming six years into six minutes, fellas. Take your time!
5;9;Forgetting Sarick Mortshall;Rick;Now that's what I'm talking about! If ya nail this next one, I've got bird quaaludes. And I might even share.
5;9;Forgetting Sarick Mortshall;Morty;Y-You know you can stop doing that for my benefit. Y'know or-or keep doing it. Doesn't matter. I'm out. I'm walking away.
5;9;Forgetting Sarick Mortshall;Rick;Wait. Morty. Don't go. Not until you see this! Commence bird on a wire! Yeeeeaaaahhhhh!
5;9;Forgetting Sarick Mortshall;Morty;Jerk.
5;9;Forgetting Sarick Mortshall;Morty;Hey, let's hang out. We're like brothers now, we both got away y'know, w-where are you at?
5;9;Forgetting Sarick Mortshall;Nick;Ooh, you know what, shoot, can't. I'm an alien, um, so --
5;9;Forgetting Sarick Mortshall;Morty;"That's okay, Rick turned my bike into a spaceship for solo adventures"" like picking up his Venusian foot ointment. God I'm seeing it so clearly now."""
5;9;Forgetting Sarick Mortshall;Morty;Oh. Wait. I-It says here you're on Earth.
5;9;Forgetting Sarick Mortshall;Nick;Yeah. Ah. Don't come here.
5;9;Forgetting Sarick Mortshall;Morty;Why not? Look, I-I get it, my room is sometimes messy too, I'll-I'll pick you up right outside your... ...mental asylum.
5;9;Forgetting Sarick Mortshall;Nick;Busted.
5;9;Forgetting Sarick Mortshall;Morty;"You literally said I'm free."""""
5;9;Forgetting Sarick Mortshall;Nick;I'm literally not free. Stop! That's my blanket!
5;9;Forgetting Sarick Mortshall;Morty;How do you know Rick?
5;9;Forgetting Sarick Mortshall;Nick;Look I came to your place with him one night after the bar closed. I started messing around in your garage and I spilled that portal stuff on me and he... kind of launched me to Australia... like with this weirdly primitive catapult, but -- 
5;9;Forgetting Sarick Mortshall;Morty;but the ammunition is an airtight carbon chamber, yeah, that-that -- that's how we lost our cable guy.
5;9;Forgetting Sarick Mortshall;Nick;Anyways, that kind of experience shakes you up. So, sorry I misled you, have a nice life.
5;9;Forgetting Sarick Mortshall;Mental Asylum Guard;Nick. You got a visitor.
5;9;Forgetting Sarick Mortshall;Morty;Damn, what happened to you?
5;9;Forgetting Sarick Mortshall;Nick;The guards like to beat us on Sundays. Still better than Mondays.
5;9;Forgetting Sarick Mortshall;Morty;Geez, what happens then?
5;9;Forgetting Sarick Mortshall;Nick;They lick our faces when we're tied down. Plus it's meat loaf day.
5;9;Forgetting Sarick Mortshall;Morty;Well... you're leaving now, buddy.
5;9;Forgetting Sarick Mortshall;Nick;Whoa, whoa, whoa!
5;9;Forgetting Sarick Mortshall;Morty;I-I swiped 'em off the guard on my way in.
5;9;Forgetting Sarick Mortshall;Nick;I-I mean, sure, yeah, I could undo my lock, but then what? After the smartest guy in the world's done with ya, it's kinda hard to find a footing again.
5;9;Forgetting Sarick Mortshall;Morty;That's why I need to get you out of here. We're not the problem, he is. And if you can have a fresh start, then maybe I can too. It's not like it's a prison break. We're just leaving, like, a hospital that wants to help you extra bad. Follow me!
5;9;Forgetting Sarick Mortshall;Mental Asylum Guard;Hey get back here, you better open this door!
5;9;Forgetting Sarick Mortshall;Mental Asylum Patient;I can fly!
5;9;Forgetting Sarick Mortshall;Mental Asylum Guard;Keep running, Nick. The more you sweat, the saltier your cheeks.
5;9;Forgetting Sarick Mortshall;Morty;Lick this!
5;9;Forgetting Sarick Mortshall;Nick;Thanks, Morty. That dude's got a tongue like a cat.
5;9;Forgetting Sarick Mortshall;Mental Asylum Guard;Stop those Portal Boys!
5;9;Forgetting Sarick Mortshall;Nick;Did you hear that? That's gonna stick!
5;9;Forgetting Sarick Mortshall;Morty;Damn. Just like Jackie Chan!
5;9;Forgetting Sarick Mortshall;Nick;Hah! I guess that makes me Chris Tucker.
5;9;Forgetting Sarick Mortshall;Morty;I-I guess?
5;9;Forgetting Sarick Mortshall;Mental Asylum Guard;Gonna get you!
5;9;Forgetting Sarick Mortshall;Morty;Holy shit! Did you see that? I mean you blinded a guy with puke!
5;9;Forgetting Sarick Mortshall;Nick;Oh, it was insane. Gimme dap.
5;9;Forgetting Sarick Mortshall;Morty;Am I doing it right? D-D-Did I give you a dap yet?
5;9;Forgetting Sarick Mortshall;Nick;Look at us. We got out. And not just from the asylum but from Rick. You get to say what an adventure is now. You still got that list?
5;9;Forgetting Sarick Mortshall;Morty;Dude, we can't do that stuff without Rick's tech.
5;9;Forgetting Sarick Mortshall;Nick;Then it's time the Portal Boys get themselves a portal gun.
5;9;Forgetting Sarick Mortshall;Rick;Remember your training, crows. The idol should be around that corner! 
5;9;Forgetting Sarick Mortshall;Rick;Do you guys just follow training when you feel like it? That's not being trained, that's being dicks.
5;9;Forgetting Sarick Mortshall;Rick;Ah, now I see. The real treasure is empathy. And that's worth way more than any knick-knack. You guys just earned yourselves another adventure!
5;9;Forgetting Sarick Mortshall;Rick;The adventure is, you're fired. Sorry, guys, if I wanted another bleeding heart, I'd inject reanimator serum into an actual bleeding heart.
5;9;Forgetting Sarick Mortshall;Rick;Relax, this is an avian planet with 40 million species of bird, even one day of working under me will make you apex geniuses down there. Now hop into these pneumatic canisters they used to use at bank drive-thrus in the 70's.
5;9;Forgetting Sarick Mortshall;Rick;What the... Hey! Who's tractor beaming me?! Nobody tractor beams me -- Nobody descrambles my tractor beam scrambler to boot.
5;9;Forgetting Sarick Mortshall;Crow Alien;Sorry for the tractor beaming, but did you lose these two crows?
5;9;Forgetting Sarick Mortshall;Rick;Oh, uh, yeah, no I-I dropped 'em off 'cause I-I can't hold a candle to them. Y'know it s-seemed like a -- the decent thing to do.
5;9;Forgetting Sarick Mortshall;Crow Alien;Be your crows. Train yourself. Crows are then trained.
5;9;Forgetting Sarick Mortshall;Rick;I'm open to what you're describing if it's easier than wiping an unearned smirk off my grandson's face. W-What do I do?
5;9;Forgetting Sarick Mortshall;Crow Alien;Look at your crows. Be your crows.
5;9;Forgetting Sarick Mortshall;Rick;God I am so glad I'm a primate. Fine. Looking at my crows.
5;9;Forgetting Sarick Mortshall;Crow Alien;We train ourselves to stop training. The trained are untrained, we are untrained. All training is complete.
5;9;Forgetting Sarick Mortshall;Rick;Because no training was needed. My God. I-I get it, now. We are gonna shove this crow shit down Morty's throat!
5;9;Forgetting Sarick Mortshall;Morty;Nick, m-maybe this isn't a good idea. L-Like what if he catches us? He could trap me in a Matrix again.
5;9;Forgetting Sarick Mortshall;Nick;Listen to yourself. We wouldn't even be in this situation if the dude hadn't fucked us both over.
5;9;Forgetting Sarick Mortshall;Morty;Damn it. He must be showing the gun off to his stupid crows -- i-it's not fair!
5;9;Forgetting Sarick Mortshall;Nick;It's okay, we can still liberate all this other stuff.
5;9;Forgetting Sarick Mortshall;Morty;Let's only grab what we need, though. Oh, no. Shit! That's Rick's can crusher! H-He spent three weeks perfecting that.
5;9;Forgetting Sarick Mortshall;Nick;Morty, buddy, you forget that we're in this together. Besides, tell me that didn't feel the slightest bit good.
5;9;Forgetting Sarick Mortshall;Morty;I mean yeah, but w-we can't do that again.
5;9;Forgetting Sarick Mortshall;Nick;Why the hell not?
5;9;Forgetting Sarick Mortshall;Morty;Whoa!
5;9;Forgetting Sarick Mortshall;Nick;Haha!
5;9;Forgetting Sarick Mortshall;Morty;Here we go, bitch!
5;9;Forgetting Sarick Mortshall;Jerry;Son, have you fallen in with a weird stranger and are now trashing your grandpa's place? 'Cause I'll help!
5;9;Forgetting Sarick Mortshall;Morty;Dad? Psh, whatever, man.
5;9;Forgetting Sarick Mortshall;Nick;Ah. Yeah!
5;9;Forgetting Sarick Mortshall;Morty;Yeah! Now eat my ass, Rick!
5;9;Forgetting Sarick Mortshall;Nick;Suck it, Sanchez!
5;9;Forgetting Sarick Mortshall;Nick;Morty, is that what I think it is?
5;9;Forgetting Sarick Mortshall;Morty;I mean, it's the equivalent of an iPhone 3. And it's empty, but it means the Portal Boys be portal-ing!
5;9;Forgetting Sarick Mortshall;AI Voice;Rick incoming.
5;9;Forgetting Sarick Mortshall;Nick;Oh, crap, we better skedaddle!
5;9;Forgetting Sarick Mortshall;Jerry;Moooooorty.
5;9;Forgetting Sarick Mortshall;Morty;But what about my dad, he-he's like a-a... puddle.
5;9;Forgetting Sarick Mortshall;Nick;You heard the garage, Rick'll turn him back into a solid when he gets here!
5;9;Forgetting Sarick Mortshall;Morty;Sorry, Dad, gotta go be heroes. G-Gonna take your car, love you!
5;9;Forgetting Sarick Mortshall;Rick;That's us down there with the poop brown roof.
5;9;Forgetting Sarick Mortshall;Crow Alien #1;What is that?
5;9;Forgetting Sarick Mortshall;Rick;Oh. Ha. That? T-That's...nothing.
5;9;Forgetting Sarick Mortshall;Crow Alien #1;"But I see Two Crows"" written right here beside... Gene with donkey brains, half a Paul Giamatti, and... sentient shit."""
5;9;Forgetting Sarick Mortshall;Crow Alien #2;"I guess the joke"" being that crows are stupid?"""
5;9;Forgetting Sarick Mortshall;Rick;I think it's a little more nuanced than that.
5;9;Forgetting Sarick Mortshall;Crow Alien #2;Right, because you just learned empathy from us 10 minutes ago but now we're going to learn we don't get your humor? Fucking horse shit!
5;9;Forgetting Sarick Mortshall;Crow Alien #3;"Yeah, there's not a ton to get,"" genius, the ""joke"" is your grandson was so replaceable that ""even"" two crows could do it. Haha. It's funny except it's not."""
5;9;Forgetting Sarick Mortshall;Rick;Right, well, to be honest, that is how I felt at the time. But I've-I've rounded a corner. I seriously have, you guys.
5;9;Forgetting Sarick Mortshall;Crow Alien #2;Well, now it's time to round the corner of death!
5;9;Forgetting Sarick Mortshall;Crow Alien #3;Let the crow-volution begin!
5;9;Forgetting Sarick Mortshall;Rick;Aw, that sound. What have you done?
5;9;Forgetting Sarick Mortshall;Crow Alien #2;Turned crows against dozens of humans in a 300 meter radius.
5;9;Forgetting Sarick Mortshall;Jerry;Heeeelllllp... pleaseee...
5;9;Forgetting Sarick Mortshall;Crow Alien #2;Oh, now you beg for help?
5;9;Forgetting Sarick Mortshall;Rick;That wasn't me.
5;9;Forgetting Sarick Mortshall;Crow Alien #2;What do you mean?
5;9;Forgetting Sarick Mortshall;Jerry;Dooooown here.
5;9;Forgetting Sarick Mortshall;Rick;Jerry, what the fuck, why are you a puddle?
5;9;Forgetting Sarick Mortshall;Crow Alien #2;You don't deserve these!
5;9;Forgetting Sarick Mortshall;Crow Alien #3;Haha.
5;9;Forgetting Sarick Mortshall;Rick;Genius.
5;9;Forgetting Sarick Mortshall;Jerry;Caaatch you at a baaad time?
5;9;Forgetting Sarick Mortshall;Rick;Yeah, Jerry. They took my goddamn crows! Not now, Garbage Goober! Get back in your hole!
5;9;Forgetting Sarick Mortshall;Nick;Hohoho, our first adventure! This definitely the place?
5;9;Forgetting Sarick Mortshall;Morty;Yeah, Rick's been ripping these guys off for years, they'll-they'll be really -- uh, grateful. Y'know, there --
5;9;Forgetting Sarick Mortshall;Nick;Let's just get that fluid, bud. The Portal Boys are about to be in portal business!
5;9;Forgetting Sarick Mortshall;Nick;Here he is. This rat was skimming your crystal harvest and sending it to a spaceman named Rick Sanchez.
5;9;Forgetting Sarick Mortshall;Lizard People;Bastard! Screw Rick! Kick his dick!
5;9;Forgetting Sarick Mortshall;Morty;Yeah, right?! But me and Nick here, we-we put a stop to that.
5;9;Forgetting Sarick Mortshall;Lizard People Leader;The people of Kuntak thank you.
5;9;Forgetting Sarick Mortshall;Morty;He's a bad guy, right? Y-You're gonna bring him to justice?
5;9;Forgetting Sarick Mortshall;Lizard People Leader;Yeah, of course.
5;9;Forgetting Sarick Mortshall;Morty;Uh, okay, p-pleasure doing business!
5;9;Forgetting Sarick Mortshall;Nick;Not so fast, Morty. We're not leaving until we get what we came for.
5;9;Forgetting Sarick Mortshall;Morty;Funny, I'm prepared to.
5;9;Forgetting Sarick Mortshall;Nick;So hey, look, wh-what we want is portal fluid. As our thanks.
5;9;Forgetting Sarick Mortshall;Lizard People Leader;Portal fluid? You think I'd live in a lizard mine if I had portal fluid?
5;9;Forgetting Sarick Mortshall;Nick;Right, ok, or we could just kill you for it.
5;9;Forgetting Sarick Mortshall;Morty;He's kidding. He's -- t-the Portal Boys only kill with kindness.
5;9;Forgetting Sarick Mortshall;Nick;And with guns.
5;9;Forgetting Sarick Mortshall;Morty;Oh, no. Oh, no. I-I'm not the one shooting!
5;9;Forgetting Sarick Mortshall;Lizard People Leader;Kill them!
5;9;Forgetting Sarick Mortshall;Morty;I'm sorry.
5;9;Forgetting Sarick Mortshall;Morty;Stop! Stop! They're unarmed!
5;9;Forgetting Sarick Mortshall;Nick;Ahh! What the fuck?! Morty! Morty!
5;9;Forgetting Sarick Mortshall;Rick;Cool place ya got here. Very Dark Crystal meets Hot Topic. Now where are my damn crows?
5;9;Forgetting Sarick Mortshall;Rick;Seriously? Is there anything not on theme here?
5;9;Forgetting Sarick Mortshall;Crow Alien #2;Even now your primate storms our ship to assert his dominance.
5;9;Forgetting Sarick Mortshall;Crow Alien #3;Touch the sacred egg and ascend. No longer shall you take orders from this beast.
5;9;Forgetting Sarick Mortshall;Rick;But taking orders from you i-is fine?
5;9;Forgetting Sarick Mortshall;Crow Alien #2;Silence, Ape!
5;9;Forgetting Sarick Mortshall;Rick;C'mon, if you think my crows are gonna leave the great thing we have for whatever high fantasy bullshit this is? You 're wrong. R-Right, guys? Th-This is seriously a toss-up. 
5;9;Forgetting Sarick Mortshall;Rick;Uh...someone wanna get that? Oh. It's me, isn't it? Woof. Lemme just make sure it's not an emergency... Yello.
5;9;Forgetting Sarick Mortshall;Morty;Rick, I'm so sorry, I-I messed up big! 
5;9;Forgetting Sarick Mortshall;Rick;Morty? It's okay, y-ya can't be worse off than me.
5;9;Forgetting Sarick Mortshall;Morty;I-I got portal splashed, robbed you, jumped into a rebound with a psycho, and-and left a trail of dead!
5;9;Forgetting Sarick Mortshall;Rick;Wow, somebody's been busy.
5;9;Forgetting Sarick Mortshall;Morty;I-I did it 'cause you hurt my feelings w-when you chose the two crows!
5;9;Forgetting Sarick Mortshall;Rick;Jesus, it was a bit, I'm getting my ass kicked by this dumb fucking crow story, it's all gone tits up.
5;9;Forgetting Sarick Mortshall;Morty;Ha, okay, I-I miss you, man.
5;9;Forgetting Sarick Mortshall;Rick;Uh, goddamn it, might've been a bit too frank there. Yeah... gonna have to call ya back.
5;9;Forgetting Sarick Mortshall;Morty;Ahh! Gah!
5;9;Forgetting Sarick Mortshall;Nick;Tiny-handed little brat -- You think you can fuck with me and get away with it?! Then you don't know Nick.
5;9;Forgetting Sarick Mortshall;Nick;Busted. You don't get it, do you? As long as we have these portals, you can never escape me.
5;9;Forgetting Sarick Mortshall;Morty;What the hell, man! I-I thought we were both victims of Rick's abuse.
5;9;Forgetting Sarick Mortshall;Nick;Maybe we are, maybe we're not. Maybe we both just drink at the same bar and maybe one night I tried to take his portal gun. See I thought Rick was my ticket to something special, but it turns out you were, Morty. And look at me now -- I'm a Portal Boy. 
5;9;Forgetting Sarick Mortshall;Morty;That name sucks! I was just trying to yes-and!
5;9;Forgetting Sarick Mortshall;Nick;You don't get it, Morty. We're partners. Now fall in line or I'll make your life a living hell.
5;9;Forgetting Sarick Mortshall;Morty;No...thank...you.
5;9;Forgetting Sarick Mortshall;Nick;Pity, I can't have you connected to me if you're not on my side. That means I gotta kill you.
5;9;Forgetting Sarick Mortshall;Morty;The thing is, I already got a partner, and there's no room for promotions.
5;9;Forgetting Sarick Mortshall;Nick;What the fuck did you just do?
5;9;Forgetting Sarick Mortshall;Morty;Cut you out of my life.
5;9;Forgetting Sarick Mortshall;Crow Alien #2;See how quickly your allies abandon you, Rick Sanchez?
5;9;Forgetting Sarick Mortshall;Rick;Lucky for me, abandonment's my bread and butter.
5;9;Forgetting Sarick Mortshall;Crow Alien #1;Oh, shit! You were supposed to die!
5;9;Forgetting Sarick Mortshall;Rick;I gotta hand it to you... I was iffy about this one but crow tech slaps!
5;9;Forgetting Sarick Mortshall;Crow Alien #2;Finish him, you fools!
5;9;Forgetting Sarick Mortshall;Rick;Go ahead. Do it. You guys look so rad. I deserve to go out this way!
5;9;Forgetting Sarick Mortshall;Two Crows;Bird...qua...luudes.
5;9;Forgetting Sarick Mortshall;Rick;Done. Oh, my god, that was awesome. Y-You could've killed me back there. H-How did you guys ever forgive me?
5;9;Forgetting Sarick Mortshall;Rick;Right, 'cause this toxic thing I have with Morty doesn't define us. Man, crows are empathetic as fuck! Definitely saving this one! Rick and Two Crows!
5;9;Forgetting Sarick Mortshall;Rick;Oh, my god, Morty. Here, here come here l-let-let grandpa fix you up. What do you want, a robot hand? A lizard hand? I can make it big again like that one time?
5;9;Forgetting Sarick Mortshall;Morty;Just my regular hand!
5;9;Forgetting Sarick Mortshall;Rick;Right, not a time for bits, I get it. There ya go, good as new.
5;9;Forgetting Sarick Mortshall;Morty;So we're like, back-back, right? Rick and Morty, together again. Fu-Full reset?
5;9;Forgetting Sarick Mortshall;Rick;No. No, Morty, I think we're done.
5;9;Forgetting Sarick Mortshall;Morty;Be-Because I spilled the portal fluid and didn't tell you?
5;9;Forgetting Sarick Mortshall;Rick;No, Morty. 'Cause you were too afraid to tell me what we had was abusive. Don't you see? I'm a bad partner because I never made you a true partner. The crows made me see that. I thought they were a joke like you, but it turns out they're more enlightened than any of us.
5;9;Forgetting Sarick Mortshall;Morty;O-Okay? And-And what's the undercut?
5;9;Forgetting Sarick Mortshall;Rick;You're not hearing me. I will never be the same so I need to leave with the crows and see what more they can teach me.
5;9;Forgetting Sarick Mortshall;Morty;Oh. Oh.
5;9;Forgetting Sarick Mortshall;Rick;Here, I want you to have this.
5;9;Forgetting Sarick Mortshall;Morty;Oh, wow I... You know what, Rick? You really have changed.
5;9;Forgetting Sarick Mortshall;Rick;Thanks, Morty. I'll always be your grandpa, Morty. Just kinda obsessed with crows now.
5;9;Forgetting Sarick Mortshall;Rick;Aww shit! Rick and Two Crows! Kicking off my new franchise! The galaxy is our telephone wire! We'll do a thousand seasons, 14 episodes each, 9-9 seconds a pop, because that's the future of viewing -- shows on your shoes -- Sneaki! That's when you've got everybody's attention -- when they're putting crap on their feet. That's when they wanna laugh. Cry. Or feel anything besides a shoe going on their foot! Watch sitcoms on your sneakers!
5;9;Forgetting Sarick Mortshall;Rick;The Rick and Two Crows Show, we're gonna be layin' -- layin' walnuts on the road for car tires to open em' you know what I mean? Forever, it's Rick and Two Crows, forever!
5;9;Forgetting Sarick Mortshall;Garbage Goober's Wife;Where do you think you're going?
5;9;Forgetting Sarick Mortshall;Garbage Goober;Oh, well, ya know... the-the red light usually means there's... garbage...
5;9;Forgetting Sarick Mortshall;Garbage Goober's Wife;Did you seriously not talk to Rick yet?
5;9;Forgetting Sarick Mortshall;Garbage Goober;I kinda hinted at it. L-Look, I know it's not the job I came here for but it's an honest living.
5;9;Forgetting Sarick Mortshall;Garbage Goober's Wife;Goddamn it, Harold. What do they call you -- Garbage Goober? You are a doctor for god sake!
5;9;Forgetting Sarick Mortshall;Garbage Goober;Look, I don't know how I let this happen but I-I've let it play out so long that I can't stop now.
5;9;Forgetting Sarick Mortshall;Garbage Goober's Wife;You're a coward.
5;9;Forgetting Sarick Mortshall;Garbage Goober;You're right. This ends here and now.
5;9;Forgetting Sarick Mortshall;Summer;Garbage Goober, we got freshy trash trash for ya! Extra stinky just the way you like it!
5;9;Forgetting Sarick Mortshall;Garbage Goober;Mmm, trash, I love trash... yum yum trash, I wanna eat trash.
5;10;Rickmurai Jack;Alien woman;It's the crowmad!
5;10;Rickmurai Jack;Owl 1;Give it a second. Maybe he's taking it out to surrender.
5;10;Rickmurai Jack;Short alien man;He's anti-heroic, run!
5;10;Rickmurai Jack;Owl 2;I don't understand.
5;10;Rickmurai Jack;Owl 3;He's only one man!
5;10;Rickmurai Jack;Rick;With the power of a thousand crows!
5;10;Rickmurai Jack;Owl 3;Good luck.
5;10;Rickmurai Jack;Owl 2;Crows and owls have always been at war, but why do you care? What's the point?
5;10;Rickmurai Jack;Rick;Here's two.
5;10;Rickmurai Jack;Morty;Haha, yeah, cool.
5;10;Rickmurai Jack;Rick;Morty?
5;10;Rickmurai Jack;Morty;H-hey man. G-good to see you. Y-you're like, looking like, into crows. Still.
5;10;Rickmurai Jack;Rick;Oh, uh, two crows, you remember Morty. Morty, two crows. It's good to see you, but give me more of a heads-up.
5;10;Rickmurai Jack;Morty;Oh well I-I was just in the neighborhood, i-it wasn't like—
5;10;Rickmurai Jack;Rick;It's just that the battle for crows is kinda never-ending.
5;10;Rickmurai Jack;Morty;Huh. Right. A little pointless then, right? That… came out wrong. S-sounded judgey.
5;10;Rickmurai Jack;Crow-horse;Crow-horse. Crow-horse. Crow-horse.
5;10;Rickmurai Jack;Two crows;Caw, caw, caw.
5;10;Rickmurai Jack;Morty;Okay. It looks like— it looks like they're leading you to a thing.
5;10;Rickmurai Jack;Rick;Take care, Morty.
5;10;Rickmurai Jack;Morty;You-you too. U-uh I'm doing good, by the way. Oh, my dad was gonna eat that yogurt you left in the fridge, but I-I told him—
5;10;Rickmurai Jack;Rick;Ahem. I'm lookin' for Crowscare. The scarecrow. The evil scarecrow. Come on, whoever gives him up first lives.
5;10;Rickmurai Jack;Rick;Fine, I can kill an extra asshole. Helps me get my steps in.
5;10;Rickmurai Jack;Morty;Rick!
5;10;Rickmurai Jack;Rick;Morty?
5;10;Rickmurai Jack;Pussifer;Wood?!
5;10;Rickmurai Jack;Pussifer;Gahhh!
5;10;Rickmurai Jack;Rick;Uh, Morty. Why are you now like forty?
5;10;Rickmurai Jack;Morty;Th-that's how long it's been, Rick.
5;10;Rickmurai Jack;Rick;Oh. Um, I guess we can have a drink together then.
5;10;Rickmurai Jack;Morty;Do you have a rum and coke?
5;10;Rickmurai Jack;Waiter;What are you, twenty?
5;10;Rickmurai Jack;Morty;Oh-ho-ho. Bless your heart.
5;10;Rickmurai Jack;Rick;Time be going by, don't she?
5;10;Rickmurai Jack;Morty;That's your reaction to finding out you wasted your entire life?
5;10;Rickmurai Jack;Rick;I feel okay.
5;10;Rickmurai Jack;Morty;Well-well, what about me?
5;10;Rickmurai Jack;Rick;Woah. Excuse us boys, you don't wanna be here for this.
5;10;Rickmurai Jack;Two crows;Caw.
5;10;Rickmurai Jack;Morty;I thought if I gave you enough space, you'd outgrow this phase.
5;10;Rickmurai Jack;Waiter;Here's your drink, poser.
5;10;Rickmurai Jack;Morty;Dad got sick, you know. Stage four. Heh, you woulda loved it. Summer's a nurse. Well, pretty much a nurse. Sh-she married a junkie. Rick, come home. While we still got a little time.
5;10;Rickmurai Jack;Rick;Morty, what we had wasn't healthy.
5;10;Rickmurai Jack;Morty;And this is? Y-y-you had a thousand adventures with these crows. When are you gonna kill their Big Bad?
5;10;Rickmurai Jack;Rick;First off, the will-they kill-they is everything to my guys. And second, fuck you for trying to undermine my happiness.
5;10;Rickmurai Jack;Morty;This may be the last time you lay eyes on me!
5;10;Rickmurai Jack;Rick;I hope that's not true, Morty. Because you look like sh-urrp-shit, and this is not how I wanna remember you.
5;10;Rickmurai Jack;Crowscare;Now that I have his two crows, nothing will stop me from eliminating Crow Rick!
5;10;Rickmurai Jack;Two crows;Caw, caw, caw.
5;10;Rickmurai Jack;Crowscare;Don't defend him to me, I don't even get what you see in him.
5;10;Rickmurai Jack;Two crows;Caw, caw.
5;10;Rickmurai Jack;Crowscare;You're right, we should be enjoying the time we have together.
5;10;Rickmurai Jack;Crowscare;Crow Rick!
5;10;Rickmurai Jack;Two crows;Caw.
5;10;Rickmurai Jack;Crowscare;Oh, I know what this must look like but—
5;10;Rickmurai Jack;Rick;Looks like my arch-nemesis Crowscare and my sidekicks planning adventures together.
5;10;Rickmurai Jack;Crowscare;You are hardly the victim here. I was adventuring with these two crows before you ever came along.
5;10;Rickmurai Jack;Two crows;Caw, caw, caw.
5;10;Rickmurai Jack;Rick;What do you mean, 'using me as a rebound'?
5;10;Rickmurai Jack;Two crows;Caw.
5;10;Rickmurai Jack;Rick;You feel like I was using you as a rebound too? Well shit, this lost all meaning. Guess it could've been worse. At least 'adventuring' was just a metaphor for romantic partnership so it's not a real breakup.
5;10;Rickmurai Jack;Crowscare;Speak for yourself. We immensely enjoy each other's bodies.
5;10;Rickmurai Jack;Rick;What?! Eugh, no!
5;10;Rickmurai Jack;Crowscare;Sounds like the man's asking for proof! Let's show him, fellas!
5;10;Rickmurai Jack;Two crows;Caw, caw, caw.
5;10;Rickmurai Jack;Crowscare;Ah, aah.
5;10;Rickmurai Jack;Rick;I-I asked for zero proof! Zero proof!
5;10;Rickmurai Jack;Rick;I'm giving you free will. Yah!
5;10;Rickmurai Jack;Crow-horse;Submit to Crow-horse!
5;10;Rickmurai Jack;Rick;Whoops.
5;10;Rickmurai Jack;Morty;R-rick?
5;10;Rickmurai Jack;Rick;Wubba lubba dub dub! I'm back, pal!
5;10;Rickmurai Jack;Jerry;Morty, who's at the door?
5;10;Rickmurai Jack;Rick;Wait a minute, I thought you died gruesomely. W-what the hell's going on here?
5;10;Rickmurai Jack;Morty;See, um th-the thing is, uh—
5;10;Rickmurai Jack;Beth;Can you please make Morty fourteen again, dad? This is ridiculous.
5;10;Rickmurai Jack;Morty;Okay, look, I-I may have used an aging serum to kind of emotionally blackmail you a little.
5;10;Rickmurai Jack;Rick;I kinda figured and I totally get it, Morty. I-I'm done with the two crows, like they were super clingy and I'm ready to make this work.
5;10;Rickmurai Jack;Morty;Let's just hit the reset button.
5;10;Rickmurai Jack;Beth;Well no, honey, not a reset, okay? Tell your grandpa that you're worthy of his respect and you wanna be treated differently from now on.
5;10;Rickmurai Jack;Morty;I refuse to do that, I'm desperate to get back together.
5;10;Rickmurai Jack;Jerry;Just like his old man.
5;10;Rickmurai Jack;Rick;Don't worry honey, that's just Morty's middle age talking. He'll be less codependent once we get more of his life in front of him again.
5;10;Rickmurai Jack;Summer;Uh, I'd like him to stay forty so he can keep buying my friends molly. I'd rather throw my vote away than use it to support a flawed system.
5;10;Rickmurai Jack;Morty;Can we make our first adventure fixing this? I-I keep thinking about lawn care.
5;10;Rickmurai Jack;Rick;Okay buddy, who sold you this shitty aging serum? What did he look like?
5;10;Rickmurai Jack;Morty;Just like you. I-I got it from the Citadel.
5;10;Rickmurai Jack;Rick;Hot damn! Hitting the ground running with a Citadel episode. See you later, masturbators.
5;10;Rickmurai Jack;Andy;Hi! I'm the Citadel's new mascot, Andy! Because this place wouldn't be home without Ricks aaand-ey Mortys!
5;10;Rickmurai Jack;Morty;Dumb.
5;10;Rickmurai Jack;Rick;Oof, what happened to this place?
5;10;Rickmurai Jack;Morty;There's a Morty president now.
5;10;Rickmurai Jack;Rick;Ah, that's cute. They rebuilt, and made it nicer.
5;10;Rickmurai Jack;Morty;They made it Glendale.
5;10;Rickmurai Jack;Rick;Goddamn you are cantankerous.
5;10;Rickmurai Jack;Morty;Even pooping hurts now.
5;10;Rickmurai Jack;Rick;Yeah, well, this place is gonna fix you right up.
5;10;Rickmurai Jack;Employee Morty;Okay, so… we've got a standard Morty that's been aged to forty.
5;10;Rickmurai Jack;Rick;Can you reverse it?
5;10;Rickmurai Jack;Employee Morty;Well if you look at it like a bone, what we can do is break his age in two places, remove the middle and graft its ends back together.
5;10;Rickmurai Jack;Morty;Th-th-that sounds really violent.
5;10;Rickmurai Jack;Rick;It's not a literal bone, Morty.
5;10;Rickmurai Jack;Morty;Oh, Okay.
5;10;Rickmurai Jack;Employee Morty;Brace yourself, the process does also break every bone in your body.
5;10;Rickmurai Jack;Morty;Wait, ahhhh! Ooh, ow!
5;10;Rickmurai Jack;Toddler Morty 1;I like crayons.
5;10;Rickmurai Jack;Toddler Morty 2;Girls are gross.
5;10;Rickmurai Jack;Morty;I-I-I think I feel like myself again.
5;10;Rickmurai Jack;Rick;Eh, you look a little weird. Your skin's all pink like a baby mouse. Is that normal?
5;10;Rickmurai Jack;Employee Morty;Probably. Uh, sign here for storage or disposal of the twenty-six years we removed.
5;10;Rickmurai Jack;Rick;Wait, what? I ain't payin' to store twenty-six years.
5;10;Rickmurai Jack;Employee Morty;Well, then you're taking it with you.
5;10;Rickmurai Jack;Twenty-Six Year Old Morty;I'm almost ready to sell out.
5;10;Rickmurai Jack;Rick;Alright, what's disposal cost?
5;10;Rickmurai Jack;Twenty-Six Year Old Morty;S-something unfair's happening!
5;10;Rickmurai Jack;Deformed Morty;There's no escape! No escape!
5;10;Rickmurai Jack;Twenty-Six Year Old Morty;Let me help you, this is not a good look!
5;10;Rickmurai Jack;Rick;Oh boy.
5;10;Rickmurai Jack;Morty;Hey, they shot me!
5;10;Rickmurai Jack;Police Morty;You are seriously hurting the Citadel experience!
5;10;Rickmurai Jack;Deformed Morty;Listen to me!
5;10;Rickmurai Jack;Police Morty;Drop the gun!
5;10;Rickmurai Jack;Deformed Morty;Death is coming for us all, and the Citadel is a weapon of mass destruc—
5;10;Rickmurai Jack;Rick;Woof. You're about to get suspended with pay. Come on, Morty. Let's get out of here before this gets political.
5;10;Rickmurai Jack;Twenty-Six Year Old Morty;U-uh. Was I influential?
5;10;Rickmurai Jack;Morty;Yeah, y-you were influential. You had like seven— seven blogs.
5;10;Rickmurai Jack;Twenty-Six Year Old Morty;Tight. Uh.
5;10;Rickmurai Jack;Rick;Ugh. Too late.
5;10;Rickmurai Jack;Secret Service Rick;C-137. President Morty requests you join him for dinner.
5;10;Rickmurai Jack;Morty;Woah! S-seriously?
5;10;Rickmurai Jack;Rick;You know I destroyed this place?
5;10;Rickmurai Jack;Secret Service Rick;You've been pardoned for that, sir.
5;10;Rickmurai Jack;Morty;Rick, let's have dinner with the Morty president.
5;10;Rickmurai Jack;Rick;Morty, the idea was to get back to simple adventures. The Citadel runs on canon.
5;10;Rickmurai Jack;Morty;Okay. I guess things really are going right back to how they were.
5;10;Rickmurai Jack;Rick;Fine, I could eat. But the second he reveals he's evil, we're gone.
5;10;Rickmurai Jack;Morty;I don't know. Tastes pretty good.
5;10;Rickmurai Jack;Rick;Okay, let me know if you start feeling poisony. Good to have you back, buddy.
5;10;Rickmurai Jack;President Morty;Sorry I'm late. Never really ends around here.
5;10;Rickmurai Jack;Rick;Look at this Morty. They really did make a you the president.
5;10;Rickmurai Jack;President Morty;And I hate 'em every day for it. But wow, Rick C-137. Now that's a guy to move your schedule around for. Not-not here to blow the place up again, I hope. Ha ha.
5;10;Rickmurai Jack;Rick;Ha. Not unless you try to keep me here.
5;10;Rickmurai Jack;President Morty;Geez, wouldn't dream of it. But it's amazing you dropped by because I was eventually gonna hunt you down.
5;10;Rickmurai Jack;Rick;There's the reveal. Let's dance.
5;10;Rickmurai Jack;President Morty;Ha, geez.
5;10;Rickmurai Jack;Morty;Come on, man. The guy got elected president. By Ricks and Mortys. He's being really nice.
5;10;Rickmurai Jack;Rick;All politicians are nice.
5;10;Rickmurai Jack;President Morty;He's a hot bag of peanuts, isn't he?
5;10;Rickmurai Jack;Morty;We've been through a lot, a-and he does not like—
5;10;Rickmurai Jack;Rick;Serialized drama.
5;10;Rickmurai Jack;President Morty;Right, no drama. Keep it episodic. Ricks never look back. Waste of a legend in his case. You know, he practically built this place.
5;10;Rickmurai Jack;Morty;Wait, what?
5;10;Rickmurai Jack;Rick;And now you're running it squeaky clean, right? That's why you got deformed Mortys comin' up through the sewer lines talking about 'hope' and 'change'.
5;10;Rickmurai Jack;President Morty;Fair enough.
5;10;Rickmurai Jack;Morty;Good clap-back, Rick. What's the deal with that, Mr. P?
5;10;Rickmurai Jack;President Morty;I got a little project going on, acquired some hands-on labor. It would require less if you were willing to tell me how one might bring down the Central Finite Curve.
5;10;Rickmurai Jack;Rick;Alright, time to go Morty.
5;10;Rickmurai Jack;Morty;I wanna know what he's talking about.
5;10;Rickmurai Jack;President Morty;Yeah, you've come all this way. Can you give me ten more seconds?
5;10;Rickmurai Jack;Rick;Literally ten? Because now it would be six.
5;10;Rickmurai Jack;President Morty;Oh, I'm fine with that. Make it two… one. Like I said, would've been a big help for you to tell me, but I should have everything I need from you now. Let me just make sure…
5;10;Rickmurai Jack;Rick;You can't scan an entire brain over appetizers.
5;10;Rickmurai Jack;President Morty;Oh, most of yours got scanned a looong time ago.
5;10;Rickmurai Jack;President Morty;You probably don't remember.
5;10;Rickmurai Jack;Rick Stan Lee;Check out season one, episode nine, Rickheads. Excel-uurp-cior!
5;10;Rickmurai Jack;Rick;Evil Rick.
5;10;Rickmurai Jack;Morty;We kicked his ass.
5;10;Rickmurai Jack;President Morty;Evil Rick. I love it. Smartest man in the universe, with an ego so big you could just grab it like a joystick.
5;10;Rickmurai Jack;President Morty;Looks complete. I was afraid I'd have to kill every Rick on the Citadel to get what I needed.
5;10;Rickmurai Jack;Morty;You asshole! I vouched for you! He only came here because I asked him to. I'm sorry, Rick.
5;10;Rickmurai Jack;Rick;That apology and a screwdriver in my hand would be worth one screwdriver.
5;10;Rickmurai Jack;President Morty;"Pfft, you sell-out Mortys kill me. I'd hate you more than the Ricks you worship if there was any point. But you can't help it; you were bred for it. Wanna see?"
5;10;Rickmurai Jack;President Morty;You already know rogue Ricks used Mortys to hide themselves from the Citadel. But you might not know it worked so well that the Citadel became its own Morty market. And I'm sure you don't know how far they've gone to help supply meet demand. Sure, Ricks could scour infinity for naturally-occurring grandsons, but why bother? So much work. Such an admission of need. There are infinite versions of our grandfather, Morty. He's an infinite smear of one shitty old man, and he's attached to us infinitely through his weakness and our forgiveness. This is why we're with him. This is why we're alive.
5;10;Rickmurai Jack;Morty;What the fuck?! Rick, say this isn't true!
5;10;Rickmurai Jack;Rick;It isn't the whole truth.
5;10;Rickmurai Jack;Morty;Liar!
5;10;Rickmurai Jack;President Morty;Liar.
5;10;Rickmurai Jack;Rick;It's complicated!
5;10;Rickmurai Jack;Morty;I'm not busy!
5;10;Rickmurai Jack;Rick;Okay, Morty, remember when all I said I needed was your apology and a screwdriver in my hand? Well, I forgot I literally have a screwdriver in my hand. I mean, duh-doi, I'm basically Inspector Gadget.
5;10;Rickmurai Jack;President Morty;Uh oh.
5;10;Rickmurai Jack;President Morty;It's okay, he's free to go. He's the Rickest Rick. We'll never see him again.
5;10;Rickmurai Jack;Rick;Morty, when you came here for that serum did you refill this gun?
5;10;Rickmurai Jack;Morty;Yeah.
5;10;Rickmurai Jack;Morty;Holy shit!
5;10;Rickmurai Jack;Rick;I only know one man that ever hacked my Portal Gun, and it turned out it was evil you.
5;10;Rickmurai Jack;President Morty;Yay. He's all caught up.
5;10;Rickmurai Jack;Rick;Wait! Hold it, hold it!
5;10;Rickmurai Jack;Morty;Wh-who's that?
5;10;Rickmurai Jack;Rick;Time for Big Boy. Duck!
5;10;Rickmurai Jack;Morty;Does he like it?
5;10;Rickmurai Jack;Rick;He's a metaphor for capitalism, Morty. What do you think?
5;10;Rickmurai Jack;Rick;Yoink!
5;10;Rickmurai Jack;President Morty;You can't outrun your past, Rick.
5;10;Rickmurai Jack;President Morty;Tch, did you think my forcefield would be down the second time?
5;10;Rickmurai Jack;Rick;I was expressing disapproval of your dialogue!
5;10;Rickmurai Jack;President Morty;Ahaha. Disapprove all you want. Tonight, the quality of dialogue stops mattering. Tonight, I do that thing I wanna do, with the Curve thing.
5;10;Rickmurai Jack;Loudspeaker system;Nobody leave, everybody stay. Nobody leave, everybody stay. Nobody leave, everybody stay.
5;10;Rickmurai Jack;Rick D716;In uncertain times like these, I think it's important for me to say… Eat shit, fuck you! The drug companies paid for me to say every word, I have millions of dollars, and I don't care— oh god oh fuck no, oh—
5;10;Rickmurai Jack;Rick D716-B;And I'd just like to say that prescription drugs are great and you should buy them now.
5;10;Rickmurai Jack;Morty;What's happening, Rick?
5;10;Rickmurai Jack;Rick;He hacked the entire city's portal supply. Come on, there still might be one way out of here. Out the bottom.
5;10;Rickmurai Jack;Morty;What do you think he needed from your brain?
5;10;Rickmurai Jack;Rick;I assume schematics for the Citadel's Dimensional Drive. If he's gonna use it to blow the Curve, we do not wanna be here.
5;10;Rickmurai Jack;Morty;What is the Central Finite Curve?
5;10;Rickmurai Jack;Rick;Q and A after our survival. Hopefully we can snag some untainted fluid at the source and get the fuck outta here.
5;10;Rickmurai Jack;Rick;Or not.
5;10;Rickmurai Jack;Rick;Wow. I thought my capitalism metaphor was on the nose.
5;10;Rickmurai Jack;Morty;So did you help build the Citadel? Did you just lie to me about everything?
5;10;Rickmurai Jack;Rick;Can't you just sneak through the cave base? We turned a new leaf, Morty. We're back to simple adventures.
5;10;Rickmurai Jack;Morty;It's not a new leaf until you tell me everything.
5;10;Rickmurai Jack;Rick;Morty, we really don't have time for this. The whole place is gonna blow.
5;10;Rickmurai Jack;Morty;No, I-I don't trust you. I-I-I don't wanna do this anymore if I'm not gonna get straight answers from you.
5;10;Rickmurai Jack;Rick;Goddammit. Here's my fucking downloaded brain, Morty. You wanna jump the shark? You wanna know my stupid crybaby backstory? Knock yourself out.
5;10;Rickmurai Jack;Rick;No-not now!
5;10;Rickmurai Jack;Morty;Woah. Dead wife?
5;10;Rickmurai Jack;Rick;Yes. Now everyone can shut up about it.
5;10;Rickmurai Jack;Morty;Wow, Rick. I feel a lot better having seen all that.
5;10;Rickmurai Jack;President Morty;Of course that's the case. In their minds, they're the underdog.
5;10;Rickmurai Jack;President Morty;And that's how they justify this.
5;10;Rickmurai Jack;Rick;Morty, I'm not responsible for every fucked up Rick out there.
5;10;Rickmurai Jack;President Morty;"They literally all say that. They all have that excuse; it's part of their system. None of them have to be responsible, they're all victims of themselves. 'Oh, it's so hard to be a genius. Couldn't you just die?'"
5;10;Rickmurai Jack;Morty;Well what are you doin' about it?
5;10;Rickmurai Jack;President Morty;Jack shit. I'm leaving. Do you know what the Central Finite Curve is? They built a wall around infinity, separated all the infinite universes from all the infinite universes where he's the smartest man in the universe. Every version of us has spent every version of all of our lives in one infinite crib, built around an infinite fucking baby.
5;10;Rickmurai Jack;President Morty;And I'm leaving it. That's what makes me 'evil', being sick of him. If you've ever been sick of him, you've been evil too.
5;10;Rickmurai Jack;Morty;Rick, did you really leave the crows for me? Or did you come back because they dumped you?
5;10;Rickmurai Jack;President Morty;There you go, kid. Now you're Evil Morty too. Sooner or later, we all are, on this side of the Curve.
5;10;Rickmurai Jack;Orange Afro Rick;Don't worry, Morty. We still got a way out they never thought of. Operation Phoenix.
5;10;Rickmurai Jack;Orange Afro Morty;Doesn't that still mean, like, death?
5;10;Rickmurai Jack;Orange Afro Rick;Sure, but the joke's on them cuz we just found a backdoor to getting off this rock.
5;10;Rickmurai Jack;Female computer voice;Rerouted. Rerouted. Rerouted.
5;10;Rickmurai Jack;Female computer voice;Rerouted. Rerouted. Rerouted.
5;10;Rickmurai Jack;Morty;Oh my fucking god!
5;10;Rickmurai Jack;Rick;Come on Morty, we gotta go!
5;10;Rickmurai Jack;Morty;Woah!
5;10;Rickmurai Jack;President Morty;You can come if you want.
5;10;Rickmurai Jack;President Morty;Don't blame me if you don't.
5;10;Rickmurai Jack;Rick;Ugh. From where I sit, Morty, that's the best deal on the table. I-I don't have a real plan.
5;10;Rickmurai Jack;Rick;Thanks, pal. I-I'm glad you ignored my advice.
5;10;Rickmurai Jack;President Morty;It's just as well. I lied. That second seat's a toilet.
5;10;Rickmurai Jack;Morty;Oh, super dick move. But weirdly kind of cool to admit it.
5;10;Rickmurai Jack;Rick;Geez, you guys really are bred for forgiveness. Let's go.
5;10;Rickmurai Jack;Rick;Say goodbye to the Citadel, fellas.
5;10;Rickmurai Jack;Mr. Poopybutthole;Woo-wee. Evil Morty. That was quite a scheme. Makes me wonder if there's an evil me out there. But I guess, sometimes I look at my life, and I may not even need 'im. Cuz, well, guess I made a pretty big mess of things myself. Ooo eee.
5;10;Rickmurai Jack;Mr. Poopybutthole;I never got my job at the university back. Remember that? Rick made me do karate. It was kinda funny, but I guess things went downhill from there.
5;10;Rickmurai Jack;Mr. Poopybutthole;Started isolating myself from Amy. Used to tell her everything I was feeling.
5;10;Rickmurai Jack;Mr. Poopybutthole;But then I guess I stopped.
5;10;Rickmurai Jack;Mr. Poopybutthole;Cuz I wanted her to love who she thought I was, not who I felt myself becoming.
5;10;Rickmurai Jack;Mr. Poopybutthole;Ever think about how horrified the people we love would be if they found out who we truly are? So we just dig ourselves deeper, into our lies every day , ultimately only hurting the people who were brave enough to love us.
5;10;Rickmurai Jack;Mr. Poopybutthole;Wish I didn't do that.
5;10;Rickmurai Jack;Mr. Poopybutthole;Wish I was brave enough to love them back. I don't know, maybe you should try it.
5;10;Rickmurai Jack;Mr. Poopybutthole;We don't have as much time as we think. Ooo eee.
