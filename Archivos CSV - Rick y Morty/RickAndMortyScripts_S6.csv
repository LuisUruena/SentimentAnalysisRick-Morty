6;1;Solaricks;Rick;Ugh, guess this is how it ends. I thought I was better than this. Dramatic voiceover while stranded in space? I-I guess when you're dying, the first thing to go is your creativity. Citadel's gone, and-and the saucer we escaped in is out of power.
6;1;Solaricks;Alternate Morty;Oh man, I'm so scared in here...
6;1;Solaricks;Rick;The extra Mortys went feral—
6;1;Solaricks;Alternate Morty;Gahhhh!
6;1;Solaricks;Rick; —eh, some problems solve themselves. Been drinking a lot—Morty, I told you to write this down! I-I don't have a helmet like that Avengers guy did!—been drinking a lot of my piss. Portal gun's still broken—
6;1;Solaricks;Morty; Guess that was all part of Evil Morty's plan.
6;1;Solaricks;Rick;Evil Morty? Can we stop flattering this guy? His plan was to monologue and fuck off! He basically threw a tantrum to announce he was quitting Twitter!
6;1;Solaricks;Morty;Nobody quits Twitter.  Hey, remember, like a second ago, when you pretended to not know who Iron Man was? Who was that for?
6;1;Solaricks;Rick;Shh, shh, shush, Morty. This is how we go. Bear it with grace.  Spinal cord, Robitussin as a base, then surprise me. 
6;1;Solaricks;Morty;Mom!
6;1;Solaricks;Rick;Beth, maybe!
6;1;Solaricks;Rick;Is she trying to say something?  We-we can't hear you! How dumb are... Beth, you're in a vacuum, sound travels on air!  Why am I yelling?
6;1;Solaricks;Space Beth; IS THIS A PRIVATE PARTY? OR CAN ANYONE JOIN?
6;1;Solaricks;Morty; Wow. Great.
6;1;Solaricks;Rick; Yeah, that's... Wow. Really worth it. That was not worth it! It's corny!  You! Corn! Dying of starvation here!
6;1;Solaricks;Space Beth;WHEN I DECIDED TO SAY IT, I DIDN'T KNOW IT WOULD BE...
6;1;Solaricks;Morty;Oh my God, stop explaining!  Stop explaining!
6;1;Solaricks;Space Beth;... SUBJECTED TO THIS SCRUTINY.
6;1;Solaricks;Rick;Are you finished?  She's not finished.
6;1;Solaricks;Space Beth;MAYBE I WON'T RESCUE YOU.
6;1;Solaricks;Rick;Oh, real mature.
6;1;Solaricks;Morty;Oh, nice.
6;1;Solaricks;Rick;Real classy.
6;1;Solaricks;Rick; It was a good line, honey.
6;1;Solaricks;Space Beth; I didn't need it to be. I don't care what you think.
6;1;Solaricks;Beth; Oh my god, she found you. Here, eat. Eat.
6;1;Solaricks;Morty;Oh hell yes!
6;1;Solaricks;Rick;Hold on, buddy. Our systems could go into shock from solid food.  Digestibot, convert to nutrient mass.
6;1;Solaricks;Rick;I'm just gonna risk it.
6;1;Solaricks;Beth;Since when do you guys get stranded?  Thank you, by the way.
6;1;Solaricks;Space Beth;Almost left them out there.
6;1;Solaricks;Rick;Portal travel's broken.  Mmm. Are these heirloom tomatoes? Digestibot, try these.
6;1;Solaricks;Digestibot;Yum. Yum.
6;1;Solaricks;Beth;So you can't hop realities anymore? Does that mean you'll finally have to wash your robe?
6;1;Solaricks;Rick;Good point. They need to reboot the Portal Index immediately.
6;1;Solaricks;Rick;Basically just a hard reset on the fluid. Hold tight, the Earth's gonna shake a bit.
6;1;Solaricks;Space Beth;Uhh...
6;1;Solaricks;Beth;Oh!
6;1;Solaricks;Rick; Oh, shit.
6;1;Solaricks;Morty; Wait, what? What's happening?
6;1;Solaricks;Rick;Instead of resetting portal travel, I may have reset portal travellers. Too late to apologise.
6;1;Solaricks;Jerry;Rick, why am I pulsing green? And don't say you don't know, because you're pulsing green.
6;1;Solaricks;Morty; Rick, are we about to die?
6;1;Solaricks;Rick; No, we're about to vanish from this reality.
6;1;Solaricks;Jerry;That's totally dying!
6;1;Solaricks;Rick;No it isn't! It's everyone from this reality returning to their reality of origin.
6;1;Solaricks;Morty;Back to our original universes!
6;1;Solaricks;Rick;I explained it fine, Morty. You're spoonfeeding spoons. Where is Summer?
6;1;Solaricks;Summer;Oh nice, you guys are back.  Whoa.
6;1;Solaricks;Rick; Summer, three of us are one-way blind-hopping. You gotta help us get back. There's a protocol for this in your chores server, filename 'booger-aids'.
6;1;Solaricks;Summer;Every file is 'booger-aids'!
6;1;Solaricks;Rick;I—I hate naming things! Just search for words like 'one-way blind-hop, reset map beacon'.
6;1;Solaricks;Jerry; Why do I have a reality of origin?
6;1;Solaricks;Rick;There's no time to explain, Jerry. Counting on you, Summer! One-way blind-hop beacon protocol.  Here we gooooo!
6;1;Solaricks;Jerry;So there was time to explain.
6;1;Solaricks;Rick;Don't waste extra precious seconds with your pettiness, Jerry!  Summer, let's run down—
6;1;Solaricks;Summer;One-way blind-hop reset beacon, 'booger-aids'.
6;1;Solaricks;Rick; Cool.  Wow.
6;1;Solaricks;Jerry; There was so much time to explain!
6;1;Solaricks;Rick;Yes, fine! Hindsight is 20-20. Who has ever taken this long to vanish?
6;1;Solaricks;Jerry;How did I end up not in my own universe?  Oh, my god. The Jerryboree.
6;1;Solaricks;Rick and Morty; Oh, the Jerryboree!
6;1;Solaricks;Rick; Deep cut.
6;1;Solaricks;Beth;Wait, but where's our real dad and our real Morty?
6;1;Solaricks;Summer; Buried in the backyard. 
6;1;Solaricks;Beth;That's what the possums are after.
6;1;Solaricks;Space Beth;Dad's got you in the family business too, huh?
6;1;Solaricks;Summer;Yeah, Morty's an easy mark, but Rick pays me in things like...
6;1;Solaricks;Summer; Wolverine claws.
6;1;Solaricks;Space Beth;Well, looks like you got this. See you guys in another—two years? 
6;1;Solaricks;Summer;Or you could stick around for this one? Looks like it involves Grandpa's grotty citadel.  We could, you know, break things, loot stuff.
6;1;Solaricks;Space Beth; I should... probably get back to... saving the galaxy.
6;1;Solaricks;Summer;Please?
6;1;Solaricks;Space Beth; Guess I could loot some stuff. Fine. Yeah. Okay. Let's make it quick.
6;1;Solaricks;Beth; Awesome, I've never been. Let's do this. Okay. Adventure family. Woo! 
6;1;Solaricks;Summer;Uhh... Okay!
6;1;Solaricks;Rick;Fuck.
6;1;Solaricks;Rick Prime; Excuse me? Bro, Ricks don't pass on this.
6;1;Solaricks;Voice;Rick, is that you?
6;1;Solaricks;Rick; Yeah, Diane.
6;1;Solaricks;Diane;You've been gone so long.  Did you find our daughter's killer?
6;1;Solaricks;Rick;Not yet, sorry. Still looking. 
6;1;Solaricks;Diane;You'll find him. You always do everything you set your mind to, except keep your family alive. But that was hardly your fault.
6;1;Solaricks;Rick; Mute.
6;1;Solaricks;Diane; If I could be muted, I wouldn't be too-too-too good at haunting you, would I, you dirty bear?
6;1;Solaricks;Rick;Yeah. I forgot I wanted to be haunted. 
6;1;Solaricks;Diane;I guess you predicted you might. That's where haunting comes in handy, huh?
6;1;Solaricks;Rick;Very good point, sugar.
6;1;Solaricks;Morty;Rick?
6;1;Solaricks;Morty;Hello? Original family? Sorry about last time. Rick, he was in space prison. We couldn't just—hello?
6;1;Solaricks;Morty;Aaaah!
6;1;Solaricks;Morty; Aw, geez.
6;1;Solaricks;Morty;Ah!
6;1;Solaricks;Morty; Oh!
6;1;Solaricks;Original Jerry;Agh! Ah, fuck! Dammit Morty, there's no doctors anymore.
6;1;Solaricks;Morty; Dad!?
6;1;Solaricks;Beth;Figures it's underwhelming, the one time I visit.
6;1;Solaricks;Summer;Yeah, sorry, usually, there's cowboy Rick and Mortys and stuff.
6;1;Solaricks;Beth;Looks like they could use a couple repairmen Ricks and Mortys, right?
6;1;Solaricks;Summer;Oh, tight! Little scavenger dudes. If they shoot at us, I'm allowed to...
6;1;Solaricks;Summer; do this.  Shit, yeah.
6;1;Solaricks;Summer;Space Mom, get in on this!
6;1;Solaricks;Summer;Cool Mom.
6;1;Solaricks;Space Beth;Let's keep it moving. I don't have all day.
6;1;Solaricks;Beth;I got it! I got it.  Sorry!  Sorry!  I got it. Sorry!
6;1;Solaricks;Beth; I was... gonna do it...
6;1;Solaricks;Summer; Ugh, terrestrials, am I right?
6;1;Solaricks;Diane;I kept up the search in your absence. You want a new list of potential locations?
6;1;Solaricks;Rick;You're always just one room away, huh? 
6;1;Solaricks;Diane;Yeah. Remember, if you thought you could see or touch me, it might give you a level of  com-com-comfort.
6;1;Solaricks;Rick;Right, can't have that. Come on, Summer. 
6;1;Solaricks;Diane;Who's Summer? Should I be jealous? I hope  Summer knows what happens to the people you love!
6;1;Solaricks;Old Man;Hey, Rick!
6;1;Solaricks;Rick;Hey, Mr Goldmanbachmajorian. S-still alive, huh? What's up?
6;1;Solaricks;Mr. GBM;I was hoping you could help me make sense of a note I found this morning? It's written by someone claiming to be me. They say my mind is 'held captive in a time loop, trapped in the day of a traumatic event by the agony of a formidable intelligence, but also that my captor forgot about aging, that my body spoils and yearns for death while my soul remains stuck in place, caught like a fly in amber.'
6;1;Solaricks;Rick; Right. I used to drink drink.  Uhh... no clue pal.
6;1;Solaricks;Mr. GBM;That's okay. I found other notes in the trash just like it. Poor weirdo. I pity them. Wish they could let go and move on.
6;1;Solaricks;Rick;Sounds healthy.
6;1;Solaricks;Mr. GBM;Sure would be!
6;1;Solaricks;Mr. GBM;Aaah, sweet death!
6;1;Solaricks;Diane;Was that symbolic? Are you letting go? I understand, baby. I forgive you!
6;1;Solaricks;Rick; You don't get to say that, you're not her! You're a thing I built to torture myself.  This whole fucking timeline is cursed. I gotta get out of here.
6;1;Solaricks;Diane;Because you want to move on.
6;1;Solaricks;Rick;Because I don't! And  I have to. I came back on accident. The guy I'm looking for, he's... he's not findable, Diane.  I live with a version of Beth now.
6;1;Solaricks;Diane;Sounds like a version of nice.
6;1;Solaricks;Rick;We have grandkids. That's who Summer is. She's going to get me out of here.  She reminds me of you.
6;1;Solaricks;Diane;Oh really? Is she dead too?
6;1;Solaricks;Rick; Bye, Diane.
6;1;Solaricks;Diane;You're not honestly going to fly into that rift without coordinates, are you? Don't give up on us, Rick. I don't make the rules. Haunters gonna haunt.
6;1;Solaricks;Diane;Baby, are you killing yourself?
6;1;Solaricks;Rick;I'm more embracing the win-win of risking my life.
6;1;Solaricks;Morty;Where's Mom and Summer?
6;1;Solaricks;Original Jerry;Oh, they're gone. Sorry, Morty.
6;1;Solaricks;Morty;Gone gone?
6;1;Solaricks;Original Jerry;We spent a long time in that ice. A gentle mutant licked us out, but Beth got sick and Summer... didn't thaw right.
6;1;Solaricks;Original Jerry;"With no one left to blame, I finally had to deal with myself. Buried my grief at Barnes & Noble. Four Agreements"", ""Eat Pray Love"", Frank Miller's ""The Dark Knight Returns"". Learned to accept things for what they are."""
6;1;Solaricks;Original Jerry;In a few of these, the whole brain is still intact. Makes you wonder if some people were still in there,  just trapped in the horror. Anyway, it's awesome protein.
6;1;Solaricks;Morty;I'm so sorry, Dad. But my real, original Dad beat the apocalypse. I-I-I guess we all underestimated you. Hey, w-what's that game we always try to play as a family, y—the one we never finished?
6;1;Solaricks;Original Jerry;Downbeat.
6;1;Solaricks;Morty;Yes! Let's play Downbeat. I-I bet I can find it! We can finish now!
6;1;Solaricks;Original Jerry;Yeah, you should totally do that.
6;1;Solaricks;Morty;Hey, yeah, cool, I-I got it! We'll play Downbeat and we'll-we'll camp here tonight and then rebuild the house.  You know, we got food, fresh water, and we've got family.
6;1;Solaricks;Morty;The fuck? 
6;1;Solaricks;Original Jerry; Morty. I wrote this note in advance in case you're wondering how I left so fast. My plan is to wait for you to turn your back, them I'm going to grab all your shit and split. Depending on how long you were out of the room, you'll probably be thinking I can't be that far away and you'll want to foll—
6;1;Solaricks;Original Jerry; Morty, wrote this fast 'cause had to set trap. Thought you'd have cooler shit. See other note. Bye.
6;1;Solaricks;Morty;Motherfu— 
6;1;Solaricks;Morty; Whoa, whoa! Slow down! Slow down!
6;1;Solaricks;Morty;Not cool! Oh!
6;1;Solaricks;Morty;What the hell, Dad?
6;1;Solaricks;Original Jerry;Don't take it personal, Morty. That's one of the Four Agreements. I don't remember the other three, but I know Commissioner Gordon was cool with Batman moving on.
6;1;Solaricks;Morty;Batman doesn't abandon people!
6;1;Solaricks;Original Jerry;You abandoned us.
6;1;Solaricks;Morty;I deserve that. But, you know, it... it improved you.
6;1;Solaricks;Original Jerry;Oh, am I cool enough for you now? Well, that was easy, it only cost me fucking everything!
6;1;Solaricks;Morty;Whoa, hey, I-I—
6;1;Solaricks;Original Jerry;You came back and talked about us like we weren't people, Morty! Then you bailed and left us to freeze!
6;1;Solaricks;Morty;I-I was apologizing for that earlier—
6;1;Solaricks;Original Jerry;Your mom and sister died, Morty!  And I moved on. From caring. And that is the best deal you will ever get. So take it.
6;1;Solaricks;Morty;Please don't go! I-if Rick comes back, we ca-we can find you a new reality. A new Mom, a new Summer, a... job!
6;1;Solaricks;Original Jerry;Oh, you don't get it, kid. Except for this conversation, my life is perfect. Rick was always right.  Everyone needs to let go.
6;1;Solaricks;Morty;Aww, you came back. I guess we really did form a bond.
6;1;Solaricks;Morty;Ow! Hey, stop it! Get away from me!  No! Help!
6;1;Solaricks;Summer;Alright, pin dropped, Grandpa!
6;1;Solaricks;Summer;Come and get us.
6;1;Solaricks;Rick;Come on, come on, come on!
6;1;Solaricks;Diane;Baby? Something to keep in mind—if you were pulled home by whatever happened, it's likely our target was, as well. It's also likely he's having as much trouble leaving as you are.
6;1;Solaricks;Rick;He's trapped.
6;1;Solaricks;Summer;Grandpa!
6;1;Solaricks;Rick;Oh, fuck yes!
6;1;Solaricks;Summer;Grandpa—Grandpa?
6;1;Solaricks;Rick;Summer! Gold star, always believed in you. N-now the hard part.
6;1;Solaricks;Summer;Hard part?
6;1;Solaricks;Rick;Way worse things than me can see that beacon, too. Hunker down and protect it while I grab Morty. Rick out! Try to survive!
6;1;Solaricks;Summer;Oh, shit.  Domestic Mom should hide, maybe?
6;1;Solaricks;Beth;"Domestic Mom?"""""
6;1;Solaricks;Summer;I mean, she's the cool space one.
6;1;Solaricks;Space Beth;Look, I'm not looking to get caught in whatever this is. You guys can both hide maybe, hash it out.
6;1;Solaricks;Beth;Oh, quit talking down. I'm you with the patience to do laundry.
6;1;Solaricks;Summer;Mom, stop being jealous of our bond!
6;1;Solaricks;Beth;She ran from our choices. I have to parent them.
6;1;Solaricks;Space Beth;It's not like I didn't care. That's what the clone was for. Aah!
6;1;Solaricks;Summer;Moms!
6;1;Solaricks;Rick;Morty!
6;1;Solaricks;Morty;Rick? I knew it! I knew you wouldn't leave me!
6;1;Solaricks;Morty;Ow! The fuck?
6;1;Solaricks;Rick;Morty, did you see another Rick here? Nondescript haircut, sci-fi jacket?  Eh, of course you didn't see him, you'd be dead. Or you'd be a bomb. Do you feel bomby? Nah, you woulda blown up by now.
6;1;Solaricks;Morty;Wasn't the Rick here dead? Th-th-that's why you pick places, right?
6;1;Solaricks;Rick;Uh, well, your Rick, uh, yeah, not dead, more like, not around. When I met you, I was sorta hoping he might turn up one day— You son of a bitch! I got you!
6;1;Solaricks;Morty;W-w-where are we going?
6;1;Solaricks;Rick;To kill your grandpa, little buddy.
6;1;Solaricks;Morty;Wait, what?
6;1;Solaricks;Morty;I don't understand. My original Rick killed your family? And you were just waiting for him to come back?
6;1;Solaricks;Rick;Seems like you understand fine, Morty. That was A+ re-piping.  We're here.
6;1;Solaricks;Rick;This guy, Morty, he hates being found but loves building elaborate shit. Like-like-like playing a ton of Minecraft but all on a private server.
6;1;Solaricks;Morty;Am I in a fucking K-hole right now? What is going on?
6;1;Solaricks;Rick Prime; Whoa-ho-ho, you found me!
6;1;Solaricks;Rick Prime;I shoot the first monitor, too. Listen, I'm not here. Or am I?
6;1;Solaricks;Rick Prime;There's the clone you found! Or maybe it's me, all naked! Just a lil' Keyser Soze. I mean, why would I admit it's not?
6;1;Solaricks;Rick Prime;"Oh-hoho, yeah! Look at him! Look at him go! Look at him dance! O-or me. Again, it might be me, like a Saw"" thing. I'm very sneaky. Here's a bunch of killbots to deal with while ya wrestle with that."""
6;1;Solaricks;Rick Prime;Obviously, I don't know who I'm talking to here.
6;1;Solaricks;Rick Prime;It's all prerecorded.
6;1;Solaricks;Rick Prime;But if you got this far, you probably think you're real special. Tell you what...
6;1;Solaricks;Rick Prime;Oop! There he goes! Maybe that actually was me! If you follow him down there, we can do a big fight. Fifty percent chance I'm not lying.
6;1;Solaricks;Space Beth; We're in trouble, asshole! I shouldn't have to beg.
6;1;Solaricks;Morty;Wait, my moms are in trouble?
6;1;Solaricks;Rick;Those versions of them are.
6;1;Solaricks;Morty;W-we gotta save them! Rick, this is an obvious trap. If you go down there he's just gonna kill you.
6;1;Solaricks;Rick;Good!
6;1;Solaricks;Morty;What? 
6;1;Solaricks;Rick;Now what?
6;1;Solaricks;Morty;If you don't care if you die, why do you care if I die?
6;1;Solaricks;Rick;Knock it off! Get out of here! You did this last season! You're like a suicide bomber!
6;1;Solaricks;Morty;Takes one to know one.
6;1;Solaricks;Rick;Yeah, well, you get it from him, not me.
6;1;Solaricks;Morty;I don't know him. You're my grandpa, Rick. Rick and Morty. A hundred years.
6;1;Solaricks;Rick Prime;This place totally might go up, by the way. Here's a bunch of countdowns. One of them's probably accurate.
6;1;Solaricks;Space Beth;Ah, fucking stupid 5th-dimensional stomach juices.
6;1;Solaricks;Beth;Sorry for the sitcom fight, and maybe getting us digested.
6;1;Solaricks;Space Beth;You've got incredible timing.
6;1;Solaricks;Beth;Oh, don't be a bitch. I'm parenting. Makes sense you don't recognize it. You've been out of practice for a while.
6;1;Solaricks;Space Beth;"Good! I'm glad that they have you! I don't want to be Space Mom."""""
6;1;Solaricks;Beth;You've made that clear. Just don't let Summer mistake your rejection of her for good taste.
6;1;Solaricks;Space Beth;I'm not trying to. It's all her!
6;1;Solaricks;Summer;Jesus! It'd be cool if you were around more. I don't wanna get married. I'm 17. My affection is the wind. Don't try to compete for it.  I could hear every word of that through the helmets. Thank fuck I only had to kill most of them.
6;1;Solaricks;Beth;Jesus, that ship really has sailed.
6;1;Solaricks;Space Beast;And now... we feast!
6;1;Solaricks;Rick;This emergency was oversold to me.
6;1;Solaricks;Summer;Grandpa!
6;1;Solaricks;Beth & Space Beth;Morty!
6;1;Solaricks;Morty;Moms!
6;1;Solaricks;Morty;Wait, i-if they had to wear helmets—
6;1;Solaricks;Rick;I do childproofing stuff while you're asleep.
6;1;Solaricks;Morty;Why don't you childproof Dad?
6;1;Solaricks;Beth;Ah, great reminder.
6;1;Solaricks;Rick;Wait!
6;1;Solaricks;Beth;Time to get Jerry.
6;1;Solaricks;Rick;Ugh.
6;1;Solaricks;Alternate Beth;Maybe I wouldn't be so uptight if I wasn't married to an unemployed receptacle of human fear!
6;1;Solaricks;Alternate Summer;Get a job, Dad, it's been a decade.
6;1;Solaricks;Alternate Rick;Whoof. Pretty brutal, Jer. I-I know a good alligator park if you wanna kill yourself.
6;1;Solaricks;Alternate Morty;I got expelled today.
6;1;Solaricks;Alternate Beth;What the hell, Morty?!
6;1;Solaricks;Alternate Rick;Oh, no, you got expelled. Whoa, what a horrible thing.
6;1;Solaricks;Alternate Beth;You are so fucking dumb!
6;1;Solaricks;Alternate Rick;Too bad, Morty.
6;1;Solaricks;Beth;Hi, hon.
6;1;Solaricks;Rick;Whoof, some real Season 2 vibes in there, you know what I'm sayin'?
6;1;Solaricks;Jerry; You know, never thought I'd say this, but I think I'm glad we spent that time divorced.
6;1;Solaricks;Jerry;Eh, one second.
6;1;Solaricks;Alternate Rick;I'll build a fucking swing set in the backyard!
6;1;Solaricks;Alternate Beth;What the hell Morty?
6;1;Solaricks;Jerry;You know, I may technically be from here. But I'm a goddamn interdimensional traveller now, and all of you——can kiss my sci-fi ass.
6;1;Solaricks;Beth;It gets me every time.
6;1;Solaricks;Morty;Wow, what an amazing joke I just told. A-and also, what an adventure. You know, I guess it doesn't matter where we're from if we're together, huh? Good-good final moral thing.
6;1;Solaricks;Summer;This is everyone's original dimension now.
6;1;Solaricks;Rick;Great wrap-ups, kids.
6;1;Solaricks;Season 2 Jerry;Ugh, you're back.
6;1;Solaricks;Rick;Oh shit, Season 2 Jerry!
6;1;Solaricks;Season 2 Jerry;Look, before you bust my balls, can someone help with the shower? It's colder than Beth on her anniversary. Also...  Look what I found in Rick's room!
6;1;Solaricks;Mr. Frundles;Mmm, I'm Mr. Frundles!
6;1;Solaricks;Season 2 Jerry;I don't care how cute he is, we agreed! No Boogens in the house! 
6;1;Solaricks;Rick;Wait, Season 2 Jerry! Don't!
6;1;Solaricks;Mr. Frundles;Nyaah! 
6;1;Solaricks;Morty;Oh!
6;1;Solaricks;Summer;Mr. Frundles!
6;1;Solaricks;Rick;Everybody in the car.
6;1;Solaricks;Mr. Frundles;Mmm, I'm Mr. Frundles!
6;1;Solaricks;Jerry;Wait, but I thought he was Mr. Frundles. 
6;1;Solaricks;Rick;Everybody in the car! Now!
6;1;Solaricks;Many species of Mr. Frundles; Mmm, I'm Mr. Frundles!
6;1;Solaricks;Beth;What the fuck Dad?! Why would you bring that thing into our house?
6;1;Solaricks;Rick;It was cute! Fuck we gotta find a new timeline now! You know how hard that shit is without portals? We gotta do the thing with the Rift and the beacon again! The whole fucking episode all over again! Car, fabricate some vomit bags.
6;1;Solaricks;Space Beth;Can't we just go back and fix it?
6;1;Solaricks;Mr. Frundles;Mmm, I'm Mr. Frundles!
6;1;Solaricks;Summer;I can't believe portal travel's broken.
6;1;Solaricks;Rick;I'll get to it when I get to it.
6;1;Solaricks;Morty;Lift with your knees, Mom.
6;1;Solaricks;Beth;How many times have you done this?
6;1;Solaricks;Jerry; Oh, God.
6;1;Solaricks;Beth;And you swear they die of natural causes?
6;1;Solaricks;Rick;Mm-hmm, yep.
6;1;Solaricks;Space Beth;The exact same as our old timeline? Even my stuff?
6;1;Solaricks;Rick;"Bit of a rush job, actually, so they do say parmesan"" weird."""
6;1;Solaricks;Morty;How do they say—
6;1;Solaricks;Rick;Par-mees-ian.
6;1;Solaricks;Summer;Boo.
6;1;Solaricks;Jerry;Jesus Christ.
6;1;Solaricks;Rick;I could've left you guys! You think the concept of family matters to me? I'm not even your Rick!
6;1;Solaricks;Summer;Uh-huh.

6;1;Solaricks;Beth;See you inside, Dad.
6;1;Solaricks;Beth;Sorry I was such a Dance Mom about Summer. She's your daughter too.
6;1;Solaricks;Space Beth;No, boundaries are good. But, uh, speaking of, maybe I've put up too many. Is it okay if I come around sometimes?
6;1;Solaricks;Beth;That could be nice.
6;1;Solaricks;Space Beth;That's a cute outfit.
6;1;Solaricks;Beth;The one we always wear?
6;1;Solaricks;Rick; Yes, Morty?
6;1;Solaricks;Morty;You promise I'm not, you know, bait? T-to make that Rick come back?
6;1;Solaricks;Rick;What? M-Morty, for you to be bait, the guy'd have to value something. He truly does not give a shit.  He's the real deal.
6;1;Solaricks;Morty;Parmeee...san...
6;1;Solaricks;Rick;Par-meee-sian. Par-meee-sian.
6;1;Solaricks;Morty;Par...par-meee-sian.
6;1;Solaricks;Rick;Par-me-sian.
6;1;Solaricks;Morty;Gross.
6;1;Solaricks;Rick;Yeah.
6;1;Solaricks;Morty;I hate it.
6;1;Solaricks;Original Jerry;Hello? Morty? That one big Rat?
6;1;Solaricks;Rick Prime;Whoa, this is a development.
6;1;Solaricks;Original Jerry;Gah!
6;1;Solaricks;Rick Prime;Shh. Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, lil guy. Easy. You're a Jerry, right? Never got too close to the concept. Boy, you have really arc'd out.
6;1;Solaricks;Original Jerry;Were you putting on pants?
6;1;Solaricks;Rick Prime;What? Oh, yeah, no, I was naked to fuck with a guy. Speaking of, did you talk to me, or a little kid around here?
6;1;Solaricks;Original Jerry;Maybe. Why? Because if you hate them, too... I could be down for a little team up.
6;1;Solaricks;Rick Prime;"Eh, I really don't team up"" anymore. Managing people, such a headache. Aah!"""
6;1;Solaricks;Original Jerry;Fatality. Jerry wins!
6;1;Solaricks;Rick Prime;Oh goddamn dude! Badass!
6;1;Solaricks;Original Jerry;Why are you here?
6;1;Solaricks;Rick Prime;Buddy, I have been asking myself that exact same question.
6;2;Rick: A Mort Well Lived;NPC Store Owner;Hey, you kids! Don't be bad outside my store! I keep a nice store!
6;2;Rick: A Mort Well Lived;NPC Skater #1;Give it up, old man! We're just cool bad kids doing young stuff!
6;2;Rick: A Mort Well Lived;NPC Skater #2;You guys wanna do some more skateboard moves?
6;2;Rick: A Mort Well Lived;NPC Skater #3;Which ones?
6;2;Rick: A Mort Well Lived;NPC Skater #2;The rad ones, that's which.
6;2;Rick: A Mort Well Lived;NPC;How are you kids? Did you know your Grandpa's tryin' a get your attention?
6;2;Rick: A Mort Well Lived;NPC Skater #1;Yeah yeah, screw off, weirdo.
6;2;Rick: A Mort Well Lived;Marta;Grandson, what's that mean?
6;2;Rick: A Mort Well Lived;NPC Skater #1;He's one of those cult people. They worship some psycho named Roy that says he's everybody's grandpa. 
6;2;Rick: A Mort Well Lived;NPC Skater #1;So what do you want to do today, eat some snacks, and maybe let me kiss you finally? Y'know, with my mouth and stuff?
6;2;Rick: A Mort Well Lived;Marta;This is going on right now. Let's go check it out.
6;2;Rick: A Mort Well Lived;NPC Skater #1;Awe geez.
6;2;Rick: A Mort Well Lived;Marta;Come on, just for fun, you know?
6;2;Rick: A Mort Well Lived;Roy;No, that's not what I'm -You guys keep thinking I'm a religious leader, this isn't a religion, this is actual truth. I'm a scientist in real life, but this isn't real life, this is a video game. You at least understand that much right? This is a video game?
6;2;Rick: A Mort Well Lived;Man;But you said I'm your grandson?
6;2;Rick: A Mort Well Lived;Roy;I'm saying everyone is. Everyone here, everyone in this world but me. You're all my grandson, your name is Morty, you're stuck in a video game and I'm here to get you out.
6;2;Rick: A Mort Well Lived;NPC Junkie Girl;What about me? Am I your grandson?
6;2;Rick: A Mort Well Lived;Roy;I just said everyone is!
6;2;Rick: A Mort Well Lived;Marta;Incredible!
6;2;Rick: A Mort Well Lived;Roy;Okay, okay but don't react like that, it's not a religion, this is what is happening. You and me and your sister are at an arcade called Blips and Chitz. It's been taken over by terrorists. The power went out, the game restarted, and your identity has been splintered into all the non-player characters. So I jacked in as Roy, that's the player character, to get you, my grandson, Morty, out of the game before it's over and you die. OK, question over here.
6;2;Rick: A Mort Well Lived;NPC Old Woman;Am I your grandson?
6;2;Rick: A Mort Well Lived;Roy;Jesus! Yes! Every single one of you is one five billionth of Morty. All of you, collectively, are Morty. Look I don't wanna seem impatient but there's actually a lot more that we have to get done so if this is how hard it's gonna be we are in a lot of trouble. Summer, what?! I can't do this if you keep bugging me!
6;2;Rick: A Mort Well Lived;Rick;Do you understand time dilation? I'm losing a month a second out here.
6;2;Rick: A Mort Well Lived;Summer;There's an alien army shooting people, what am I doing?!
6;2;Rick: A Mort Well Lived;Rick;It's a small group of alien terrorists, just do a Die Hard.
6;2;Rick: A Mort Well Lived;Summer;What does that mean?
6;2;Rick: A Mort Well Lived;Rick;Sneak around, use air vents. You've never seen Die Hard?
6;2;Rick: A Mort Well Lived;Summer;I'm seventeen, no I've never seen fucking Die Hard!
6;2;Rick: A Mort Well Lived;Rick;Well neither did the guy in Die Hard so you're nailing it! Good luck!
6;2;Rick: A Mort Well Lived;Marta's Mom;Larry...
6;2;Rick: A Mort Well Lived;Larry;No, I'm at the end of my rope with this kid, I swear to God.
6;2;Rick: A Mort Well Lived;Larry;You gotta be kidding me.
6;2;Rick: A Mort Well Lived;Marta's Mom;Your beautiful hair.
6;2;Rick: A Mort Well Lived;Larry;This is not a daughter's haircut.
6;2;Rick: A Mort Well Lived;Marta;I'm not a daughter, I'm a grandson.
6;2;Rick: A Mort Well Lived;Larry;Your family had a perfectly fine religion. You were raised Jewish.
6;2;Rick: A Mort Well Lived;Marta;Dad, tell me anything specific about being Jewish.
6;2;Rick: A Mort Well Lived;Larry;There's a million things! You go to the temple with the special hat, the falafafluten.
6;2;Rick: A Mort Well Lived;Marta;The falafafluten, our Jewish words are gibberish because we're a fourteen year old boy who was raised nondenominational Christian and we're in a video game.
6;2;Rick: A Mort Well Lived;Larry;I don't need to hear this schmoitenheiven. Let me ask you this, little miss grandson, little miss video game character. If you're not my daughter, why stand in my house spouting this chatschkopfka? Why even live here?
6;2;Rick: A Mort Well Lived;Jons;We have many interests but right now my primary one is the location. Of... your... safe.
6;2;Rick: A Mort Well Lived;Blitz and Chitz Employee;We exchange tokens for digital currency, we don't have a safe.
6;2;Rick: A Mort Well Lived;Jons;Correction, what you don't have is a head.
6;2;Rick: A Mort Well Lived;Jons;Is this a weapon or a medical tool? Why would you give me a gun with a laser that thin? Did you hear me tell him he wouldn't have a head?
6;2;Rick: A Mort Well Lived;Alien Terrorist;He's dead isn't he?
6;2;Rick: A Mort Well Lived;Jons;People die in surgery.
6;2;Rick: A Mort Well Lived;Arcade Game Voice;Hey, who don't touched me! I don't like being touched!
6;2;Rick: A Mort Well Lived;Jons;Check the hostages. Make sure nobody else here is doing a Die Hard.
6;2;Rick: A Mort Well Lived;NPC;Hello, hello, my name is Morty, I'm a fourteen year old boy in a video game!
6;2;Rick: A Mort Well Lived;NPC;Yeah! Geez!
6;2;Rick: A Mort Well Lived;Roy: Yeah. Look. I feel like every time I explain this, I lose followers, but;This isn't a religion. And while I do have a message from a world beyond this one, and I do need the entire world to hear my message, what I do not need is any more songs about it. Not in this genre. I'm an old school hip hop man and no that's not an invitation for you to try it because I'm just gonna say it, we're missing the mark on diversity.
6;2;Rick: A Mort Well Lived;NPC Soldier;Get down! You're all under arrest for being religious the wrong way!
6;2;Rick: A Mort Well Lived;Roy;It's not a religion. You know what, just shoot me.
6;2;Rick: A Mort Well Lived;NPC Soldier;You think your god makes you bullet proof?
6;2;Rick: A Mort Well Lived;Roy;There isn't even a god in the real world, you fragmented putz, there's extra no god in here.
6;2;Rick: A Mort Well Lived;NPC Soldier;You know what, hippy? Talking like that is why you're getting shot.
6;2;Rick: A Mort Well Lived;Marta;If you kill him, the game ends and we all die.
6;2;Rick: A Mort Well Lived;NPC Soldier;Get down, lady!
6;2;Rick: A Mort Well Lived;Marta;I'm not a lady. And you're not a soldier. We're one person, split into a lot of little pieces. You feel me? Dawg? You're not gonna hurt me. You're me.
6;2;Rick: A Mort Well Lived;NPC Soldier;My name is Kevin! I'm a Marine. I'm thirty. I'm a little racist but my best friend is an immigrant that translated for me in a generic overseas war.
6;2;Rick: A Mort Well Lived;Marta;That's not true. We're fourteen, we like pizza and masturbation, we wear a yellow shirt and we have hair that looks like a brown helmet. And we miss our family. And we're in way over our heads again.
6;2;Rick: A Mort Well Lived;NPC Soldier;Why's this always happen, man?
6;2;Rick: A Mort Well Lived;Marta;I know, right? Aw geez.
6;2;Rick: A Mort Well Lived;NPC Soldier;Aw geez.
6;2;Rick: A Mort Well Lived;Marta;Come here. Aw geez. Come here.
6;2;Rick: A Mort Well Lived;NPC;Aw geez. Aw geez.
6;2;Rick: A Mort Well Lived;Roy;Who is that?
6;2;Rick: A Mort Well Lived;NPC;Her video game name is Marta.
6;2;Rick: A Mort Well Lived;Roy;OK. See, this I can work with.
6;2;Rick: A Mort Well Lived;Summer;"Sneak around. Crawl in some vents. Do a Die Hard."""""
6;2;Rick: A Mort Well Lived;Summer;Oh my god, it's disgusting. Actually... it tastes really good. Oh my god, it's disgusting that it tastes good!
6;2;Rick: A Mort Well Lived;Jons;Frank, have you found him? Report.
6;2;Rick: A Mort Well Lived;Summer;Walkie talkie. That's Die Hard. Don't have to see it to know that.
6;2;Rick: A Mort Well Lived;Jons;This is Jons. I repeat, have you found him?
6;2;Rick: A Mort Well Lived;Summer;Breaker breaker. Walkie talkie. I got your walkie talkie. Bitch.
6;2;Rick: A Mort Well Lived;Jons;Are you doing a Die Hard?
6;2;Rick: A Mort Well Lived;Summer;Maybe. Are you? Also?
6;2;Rick: A Mort Well Lived;Jons;More or less. And my associate, Frank?
6;2;Rick: A Mort Well Lived;Summer;Your associate Frank is definitely not doing a Die Hard. You might even say he's doing a Die Easy. Because I killed him and it wasn't difficult.
6;2;Rick: A Mort Well Lived;Jons;Calm yourself, Winslow. Winslow!
6;2;Rick: A Mort Well Lived;Jons;It's not every day one meets a fellow Die Hard enthusiast, Ms...
6;2;Rick: A Mort Well Lived;Summer;Call me Die Hard.
6;2;Rick: A Mort Well Lived;Jons;"Okay. Die Hard"". Tell me. What do you know about Die Hard?"""
6;2;Rick: A Mort Well Lived;Summer;What do you care? You writing a book about Die Hard?
6;2;Rick: A Mort Well Lived;Jons;As a matter of fact, I've written several. Every sentient civilization across the galaxy eventually develops the same myth. In Centauri it's known as Tower Man. The Orionese have their Thornberg Cycle and in Andromeda it's called Foolish to Have Imagined You'd Be Able to Kill... All of them what you'd call Die Hard. The difference being that cultures like mine are aware of its importance whereas I'm starting to doubt you could even recall a single line.
6;2;Rick: A Mort Well Lived;Summer;Walkie talkie Die Hard, motherfucker.
6;2;Rick: A Mort Well Lived;Tony;Not so long ago, Grandsonism was being dismissed as a doomsday cult. But since a majority of the world decided, hey you know what, we like jerking off and playing video games and our sister is out there fighting terrorists, major strides have been made. The world is united, because the world is one fourteen year old boy, Morty. But where's it all coming from?
6;2;Rick: A Mort Well Lived;Tony;Some say Grandsonism's leader, Roy, has a secret base somewhere in these mountains. I couldn't find it so I'm standing in, in the general area with a microphone. For Good Enough News, I'm Tony!
6;2;Rick: A Mort Well Lived;Roy;There she is, my right-hand Morty.
6;2;Rick: A Mort Well Lived;Marta;Got enough spaceships?
6;2;Rick: A Mort Well Lived;Roy;Not yet. I figure five more years of game time before I can take the whole fake population into fake outer space.
6;2;Rick: A Mort Well Lived;Marta;What do we do in outer space?
6;2;Rick: A Mort Well Lived;Roy;Nothing. It's fake. We keep going. The game's map has edges, but the game's engine will let us go past them. That will force the game to reset, but first it will kick us out, which Morty should survive, I mean, whatever amount of Morty we have on board. So if you don't have five billion handkerchiefs soaked in chloroform I hope you can keep flipping idiots to our cause.
6;2;Rick: A Mort Well Lived;Marta;They're not idiots. Grandpa. They're me.
6;2;Rick: A Mort Well Lived;Roy;You'll know how funny that is when we get back. By the way, I had your genius of a father picked up, he's over there.
6;2;Rick: A Mort Well Lived;Marta;What? Why?
6;2;Rick: A Mort Well Lived;Roy;I thought you'd be grateful. And less distracted than if I let him die. He's been in real bad shape since he lost his wife.
6;2;Rick: A Mort Well Lived;Marta;My mom? 
6;2;Rick: A Mort Well Lived;Roy;Your not at all real mom, a mom in a video game. Occupied by a tiny fraction of yourself. A fraction of yourself which is now dead forever and fractions add up, so I had your Dad brought here, you're welcome, you heartless monster.
6;2;Rick: A Mort Well Lived;Larry;Marta. It's me, Dad. I converted for you. 
6;2;Rick: A Mort Well Lived;Marta;My name is Morty. So is yours. And there's no conversion, we're both Morty, it's a fact.
6;2;Rick: A Mort Well Lived;Larry;Sure, honey, anything you say. I don't want to fight. I'm proud of you. Are you mad at me because before you became the world's most powerful woman, I shamed you for your haircut and called you a slutty jobless hobo? If I were you I'd be a little mad about that.
6;2;Rick: A Mort Well Lived;Marta;You are me. And why would I be mad at myself?
6;2;Rick: A Mort Well Lived;Larry;Good point! Is there anything to eat around here?
6;2;Rick: A Mort Well Lived;Marta;There's a kitchenette in the break room.
6;2;Rick: A Mort Well Lived;Larry;A kitchenette you say, such red carpet treatment.
6;2;Rick: A Mort Well Lived;Marta;Excuse me?
6;2;Rick: A Mort Well Lived;Larry;I said thank you, I love it, we're all part of Morty. Some of us more important parts than others...
6;2;Rick: A Mort Well Lived;Marta;Man, the part of me that's my father is a twat.
6;2;Rick: A Mort Well Lived;Rick;That's also gonna be funny when we get back.
6;2;Rick: A Mort Well Lived;Winston;Next time you try to do a Die Hard... Don't hide under a long table like the guy from Die Hard.
6;2;Rick: A Mort Well Lived;Summer;Okay I won't.
6;2;Rick: A Mort Well Lived;Alien Terrorist;I thought you said she doesn't know how to do a Die Hard!
6;2;Rick: A Mort Well Lived;Jons;She doesn't.
6;2;Rick: A Mort Well Lived;Alien Terrorist;She's killing us off one by one.
6;2;Rick: A Mort Well Lived;Jons;What do you expect her to do, buy us each an ice cream? Two by two? She's improvising. Which is how she's going to fall right into our trap. I'm going to wander the arcade unarmed and when she comes across me. I'll pretend to be a hostage. And because she hasn't seen Die Hard instead of handing me an unloaded gun, she'll hand me a...
6;2;Rick: A Mort Well Lived;Summer;Die Hard! Die Hard!
6;2;Rick: A Mort Well Lived;Jons;What the hell was that?
6;2;Rick: A Mort Well Lived;Summer;Die Hard! Die Hard!
6;2;Rick: A Mort Well Lived;Jons;"You can't just keep yelling Die Hard"" into a walkie talkie and... She threw her walkie talkie away. She hates Die Hard. Which makes her the ultimate McClane. Forget everything you know about Die Hard and just go shoot that bitch!"""
6;2;Rick: A Mort Well Lived;President Leland;Thank you for meeting with me, Mr. Roy. Half the country hangs on your every word. Heck, most of the world. You're, like, kind of a pope I reckon.
6;2;Rick: A Mort Well Lived;Roy;I'm not a pope because it's not a religion we're literally in a video game
6;2;Rick: A Mort Well Lived;President Leland;I've heard the message, Roy, you're not on the clock here. So you want every single person on a space ship. But you got a bunch of holdouts. Maybe people that prefer their leaders a little more elected.
6;2;Rick: A Mort Well Lived;Roy;Right. Your voters. People that like being told what to do but don't like admitting it.
6;2;Rick: A Mort Well Lived;President Leland;Yeah not sure I'd put it that way.
6;2;Rick: A Mort Well Lived;Roy;I'm sure you'd put it a stupid way. I told you this was a waste of time. I've got ninety-two percent of you ready to vamoose, we're not gonna get the rest by making deals with parasites.
6;2;Rick: A Mort Well Lived;Marta;Mr. President. Roy is Rick. He's not us. You and I, we're Morty. Is that really so hard to believe?
6;2;Rick: A Mort Well Lived;President Leland;Kid, I've known it and I've believed it longer than you have. We both became video game characters at the same moment, but I knew the truth before you dropped your skateboard and went to your first cult meeting. How do you think a guy becomes a President in this game, honey? By not paying attention? Sorry to call you honey, I know we're both parts of a fourteen year old boy but my part's old fashioned and vaguely southern.
6;2;Rick: A Mort Well Lived;Marta;I'm confused. If you know Rick is real, why?
6;2;Rick: A Mort Well Lived;President Leland;Why hold out? Because he's a rude, entitled cock.
6;2;Rick: A Mort Well Lived;Marta;He's here to save us. He could've left the game and let us die, ...he's spent fifty years.
6;2;Rick: A Mort Well Lived;President Leland;"Fifty years, it's what? A couple hours to him? He refuses to leave without his grandson but what's grandson mean to him? Sounds like it means butler. Someone to Help Summer with her Die Hard"" whatever that means. I'll tell you what it doesn't mean. Fly fishing. A hug. A little appreciation for what is clearly a pretty decent kid. At least the eight percent of him that makes up the decent half of the greatest god damn nation on the planet."""
6;2;Rick: A Mort Well Lived;Marta;We're not a person to him yet. We're not Morty yet, we're divided.
6;2;Rick: A Mort Well Lived;President Leland;We're divided because some of us doesn't trust the guy. What happens to that part of us when we're all back together? One Morty? Indivisible? Under a cranky old bag of dicks? A man you can lock in a box with five billion pieces of his own god damn flesh and blood for fifty god damn simulated years and never hear him say I love you? Sorry pumpkin tits, that dog don't hunt. Want some heroin? It's a video game, might as well.
6;2;Rick: A Mort Well Lived;Roy;Just about ready for launch, kiddo. I can finally get outta these clothes, I don't have nearly enough pockets. And it'll be nice to have my own dick back.
6;2;Rick: A Mort Well Lived;Marta;You're fine leaving eight percent of me to die?
6;2;Rick: A Mort Well Lived;Roy;It's not your finest eight percent, Morty. And eight percent of anything is expendable. Eight percent of pizza is crust. Eight percent of the Snyder Cut was Batman dreaming.
6;2;Rick: A Mort Well Lived;Marta;I don't know what that reference is. We're in a video game.
6;2;Rick: A Mort Well Lived;Roy;Not for long, baby.
6;2;Rick: A Mort Well Lived;Marta;I'm not leaving without all of me.
6;2;Rick: A Mort Well Lived;Roy;What? Oh no, let me crunch these numbers, eight percent of five billion plus one person, my god, if you stay, it changes nothing! Bye.
6;2;Rick: A Mort Well Lived;NPC;If she's not going, I don't think my country wants to go.
6;2;Rick: A Mort Well Lived;Roy;Who invited you to chime in, monitor face?
6;2;Rick: A Mort Well Lived;NPC;Why give me a monitor if my opinion doesn't matter?
6;2;Rick: A Mort Well Lived;NPC;Your opinion isn't allowed to matter for the rest of us. We're all Morty. How many chunks of us are we supposed to give up?
6;2;Rick: A Mort Well Lived;NPC;Look, I don't know about you but I was already taking a big leap of faith, here, we're basically giving up our lives to become a tiny part of a stranger.
6;2;Rick: A Mort Well Lived;NPC;These lives aren't real.
6;2;Rick: A Mort Well Lived;NPC;Yeah but they're longer.
6;2;Rick: A Mort Well Lived;Roy;What is this, suicide by summit meeting?
6;2;Rick: A Mort Well Lived;Marta;Everyone stop. Rick. I'll get every single part of me to get on every ship and go with you.
6;2;Rick: A Mort Well Lived;Roy;Good.
6;2;Rick: A Mort Well Lived;Marta;But you have to tell us you love us.
6;2;Rick: A Mort Well Lived;NPC;I mean. At this point even if he said it, what's with the pause.
6;2;Rick: A Mort Well Lived;NPC;Screw you, wait for it!
6;2;Rick: A Mort Well Lived;NPC;Holy war!
6;2;Rick: A Mort Well Lived;NPC;Holier war!
6;2;Rick: A Mort Well Lived;NPC;Holiest war ever!
6;2;Rick: A Mort Well Lived;Tony;Loyalist Evacucratic Grandsonistas claimed the seven new cities today. While the Stayputlican Contrasurgent Confederation of Dedication to Video Game Reality invaded the territories of Mortopia, New South Saint Morty and Wemortyall. In the end, what does it matter, everyone's Morty, nobody wants to die and that's a hell of a reason to kill yourself but what can we do. Aw geez.
6;2;Rick: A Mort Well Lived;Roy;You know you're my grandson and none of this is real. What are you trying to achieve? You're only hurting yourself.
6;2;Rick: A Mort Well Lived;Marta;The only reason any of us matter is we're pieces of Morty! You taught us that, Rick. But you also taught us you don't care about Morty.
6;2;Rick: A Mort Well Lived;Roy;Here's how much I care. If you don't stop blowing up my flying saucers, I will exterminate every last one of you! Anything it takes! What do I have to say? I love and respect you, OK?
6;2;Rick: A Mort Well Lived;Marta;Too late for talk, Rick.
6;2;Rick: A Mort Well Lived;Marta;A robot. Of course.
6;2;Rick: A Mort Well Lived;Roy;I'm not gonna risk dying because if I die in the game, you go brain dead, you're welcome!
6;2;Rick: A Mort Well Lived;Marta;Better to die in Roy than to serve in hell!
6;2;Rick: A Mort Well Lived;Roy;And what about Summer? Do you not care about her? We gotta get back, Morty, we gotta help her.
6;2;Rick: A Mort Well Lived;Marta;You know what, wherever she is, I'm sure she's doing fine without your help.
6;2;Rick: A Mort Well Lived;Roy;Woof, jinx, any on...
6;2;Rick: A Mort Well Lived;NPC;Should we finish the job, blow the place?
6;2;Rick: A Mort Well Lived;Marta;No, this can't end, not like this. Do you think I jinxed her?
6;2;Rick: A Mort Well Lived;Jons;Why aren't you shooting higher?
6;2;Rick: A Mort Well Lived;Alien Terrorist;I don't wannna shoot the glass. Because...
6;2;Rick: A Mort Well Lived;Jons;You don't have to not do things that were done in Die Hard, you can shoot the glass. Shoot the glass! Throw grenades! Do everything! Just kill her!
6;2;Rick: A Mort Well Lived;Jons;Why are you here, Miss Die Hard? I want to know why you don't just leave?
6;2;Rick: A Mort Well Lived;Summer;Die Hard!
6;2;Rick: A Mort Well Lived;Jons;Wait.
6;2;Rick: A Mort Well Lived;NPC;...person on a spaceship, and then what?
6;2;Rick: A Mort Well Lived;Roy;And then we help your sister do her Die Hard.
6;2;Rick: A Mort Well Lived;Jons;Too much. It's too much.
6;2;Rick: A Mort Well Lived;NPC;Sorry.
6;2;Rick: A Mort Well Lived;Jons;I've got a special guest with me, Miss Die Hard! Or should I call you this guy's sister?
6;2;Rick: A Mort Well Lived;Marta's Daughter;Mom.
6;2;Rick: A Mort Well Lived;Marta;Hello, dear.
6;2;Rick: A Mort Well Lived;Marta's Daughter;I'm joining the other side.
6;2;Rick: A Mort Well Lived;Marta;What. Why?
6;2;Rick: A Mort Well Lived;Marta's Daughter;I wanna live in the real world with Roy. I wanna help Summer with her Die Hard.
6;2;Rick: A Mort Well Lived;Marta;His name is Rick. And we have no way of knowing if your generation is actually part of Morty.
6;2;Rick: A Mort Well Lived;Marta's Daughter;Do you know how offensive that is? It's parenting like this that pushed me into religious radicalism. Bye.
6;2;Rick: A Mort Well Lived;Marta;It's not… Not a religion. But. Okay.
6;2;Rick: A Mort Well Lived;NPC;Ma'am. It's really not safe out here. Also, it's... time.
6;2;Rick: A Mort Well Lived;Larry;Are we going on the spaceship now?
6;2;Rick: A Mort Well Lived;Marta;Pretty soon, Dad. Yeah.
6;2;Rick: A Mort Well Lived;Larry;Are you lying? You kind of said it with that tone in your voice that we use for dying people.
6;2;Rick: A Mort Well Lived;Marta;I won't lie to you. You're dying Dad, and we're... not leaving the video game. We're-we're gonna live our lives out here.
6;2;Rick: A Mort Well Lived;Larry;What? Why the fuck? Why?
6;2;Rick: A Mort Well Lived;Marta;It's more real here.
6;2;Rick: A Mort Well Lived;Larry;The hell it is! My liver hurts! I'm old here! I want to be a teenage boy. I want to jump around and do homework and jerk off all over the place.
6;2;Rick: A Mort Well Lived;Marta;But Dad. That's... we would've been one tiny part of that. In here, we get to be who we really are.
6;2;Rick: A Mort Well Lived;Larry;Great. Dead. I get to be a dead father. Who do I make the... Who do I... Who...
6;2;Rick: A Mort Well Lived;Marta;Don't talk, Dad.
6;2;Rick: A Mort Well Lived;Larry;Gotta finish my zinger.
6;2;Rick: A Mort Well Lived;Marta;You don't.
6;2;Rick: A Mort Well Lived;Larry;"Who do, who do... Who, do I... make the check out to Best Daughter Ever... Incorporated""?"""
6;2;Rick: A Mort Well Lived;Marta;Thought you would a left by now.
6;2;Rick: A Mort Well Lived;Roy;I was hoping to get at least half of you home. I can't hold out much longer. I'm pretty much beating my heart voluntarily at this point. Ok, this is a little awkward, but the time dilation has given me a chance to reflect. And I gotta say.
6;2;Rick: A Mort Well Lived;Marta;There's no need for that. I've come to tell you, I'm giving the go-ahead. All of Morty will leave with you. To the real world. To be your grandson, may we help Summer do her Die Hard.
6;2;Rick: A Mort Well Lived;Roy;I gotta say. I was not expecting that. Why the change of heart?
6;2;Rick: A Mort Well Lived;Marta;My people are staying only out of loyalty to me. I'm a relic. I don't represent them anymore.
6;2;Rick: A Mort Well Lived;Roy;You really are a good grandson, you know that? I'm proud of you, Morty.
6;2;Rick: A Mort Well Lived;Marta;Please, call me Marta. That's my video game name. Speaking of which, I do have one condition.
6;2;Rick: A Mort Well Lived;Jons;I must say I admire you, Ms. Die Hard. You were a genuine McClane. A most worthy yankee doodle ruffian. But now it's all come to an end. And the quarterback, as they say, is toast. I don't suppose you have a gun taped to your back.
6;2;Rick: A Mort Well Lived;Summer;What the hell does that mean?
6;2;Rick: A Mort Well Lived;Jons;It's how Die Hard ends. Doesn't matter now.
6;2;Rick: A Mort Well Lived;Summer;Die Hard tapes a gun to his back? That's the end of your perfect movie that you've patterned your whole criminal life after?
6;2;Rick: A Mort Well Lived;Jons;"Well it seems to have worked out pretty well for me since you're the one about to die. What was it you said? Ah yes. Walkie talkie Die Hard"" Motherfucker."""
6;2;Rick: A Mort Well Lived;Jons;Why are you laughing?
6;2;Rick: A Mort Well Lived;Summer;Well it's funny. The way you said motherfucker. Just laughing.
6;2;Rick: A Mort Well Lived;Jons;Okay. It's just that...
6;2;Rick: A Mort Well Lived;Summer;Oh does that happen in Die Hard, does John McClane laugh, and then Hans Gruber is confused, but then they start laughing together for a second.
6;2;Rick: A Mort Well Lived;Jons;That actually does happen, yes! Wait. You knew their names this whole time?
6;2;Rick: A Mort Well Lived;Summer;Not this whole time, no. You left your book in the bathroom. I read it while I took a shit. I mean, mostly the ending.
6;2;Rick: A Mort Well Lived;Summer;Yi... pe... dip pee doo, baby! Nice timing, Grandpa Rick!
6;2;Rick: A Mort Well Lived;Jons;Tochter aus Elysium.
6;2;Rick: A Mort Well Lived;Winston;Hi, remember me? You shot me on that table, and the near death experience got me reflecting. I didn't used to be like this. I ate a kid. It was dark, and I thought he was a grown-up. Ever since then I haven't eaten anybody at all. I think I was channeling all that pent up eating energy into this job. But now, thank you for freeing me.
6;2;Rick: A Mort Well Lived;Rick;Classic Tower Man. Almost too on the nose. Right, Morty?
6;2;Rick: A Mort Well Lived;Morty;Sure. I mean, whatever you say, Rick, you know best! I trust you implicitly.
6;2;Rick: A Mort Well Lived;Summer;Is he all right?
6;2;Rick: A Mort Well Lived;Rick;He's fine. Got him all out, every last piece.
6;2;Rick: A Mort Well Lived;Blitz and Chitz Employee;What's with the jacked-up Roy Machine, shouldn't you be taking that to repairs?
6;2;Rick: A Mort Well Lived;Blitz and Chitz Employee;Nah, special order. Some rich douche wants his last game to keep running, hooked it up to an external battery, we're just supposed to store it.
6;2;Rick: A Mort Well Lived;Blitz and Chitz Employee;Weird.
6;2;Rick: A Mort Well Lived;Blitz and Chitz Employee;Yeah and get this. The game's still going but Roy's dead.
6;2;Rick: A Mort Well Lived;Blitz and Chitz Employee;Wha?
6;2;Rick: A Mort Well Lived;Blitz and Chitz Employee;He's just a corpse floating at the edge of outer space but for some reason the game won't restart cause it's centered on some old lady living a full life.
6;2;Rick: A Mort Well Lived;Blitz and Chitz Employee;Sounds bad. Well. Put it in there.
6;2;Rick: A Mort Well Lived;Blitz and Chitz Employee;Hey is anybody that wants this later gonna be able to...
6;2;Rick: A Mort Well Lived;Blitz and Chitz Employee;Oh, yeah, everything's cataloged and tracked. People got the wrong idea from the size of the space but it's all supported digitally.
6;2;Rick: A Mort Well Lived;Blitz and Chitz Employee;So I can put it anywhere. Here's fine?
6;2;Rick: A Mort Well Lived;Blitz and Chitz Employee;That's as fine as anywhere else!
6;2;Rick: A Mort Well Lived;Jons Brother;Why isn't anyone attacking him?
6;2;Rick: A Mort Well Lived;Alien Terrorist;It's fucking freezing out.
6;2;Rick: A Mort Well Lived;Jons Brother;No, I think it's the sign.
6;2;Rick: A Mort Well Lived;Alien Terrorist;Well, the sign from Die Hard 3 was clearly racist.
6;2;Rick: A Mort Well Lived;Jons Brother;"Obviously. But I think we went too broad. Everybody"", I mean, who is that offending?"""
6;2;Rick: A Mort Well Lived;Alien Terrorist;Everybody?
6;2;Rick: A Mort Well Lived;Jons Brother;At this point, why even do it? I wish my brother was still alive.
6;3;Bethic Twinstinct;Morty;Oh my god, I cannot fucking believe this, here we fucking go! Oh! Jeez!
6;3;Bethic Twinstinct;Rick;Pardon the interruption. We are once again in the federal clear.
6;3;Bethic Twinstinct;Morty;Rick, what the hell?! A-Are you a Turkey Dracula now?
6;3;Bethic Twinstinct;Rick;Morty, is that a Pooplickian GamePod?
6;3;Bethic Twinstinct;Morty;Actually, it's the GamePod XL. They say it is the most realistic video game console ever.
6;3;Bethic Twinstinct;Rick;I never got you that.
6;3;Bethic Twinstinct;Morty;Space Mom did. She's in for the holiday weekend, remember?
6;3;Bethic Twinstinct;Rick;Shit, in that case, let's go, let's get out of here...
6;3;Bethic Twinstinct;Beth;I heard you smack the glass, Dad, if you bail, I'll disown you!
6;3;Bethic Twinstinct;Space Beth;Yeah, I'd say don't hop through a portal. But, oh wait, you can't.
6;3;Bethic Twinstinct;Rick;Look at it this way, Morty. Life is a subscription and Thanksgiving is your family's yearly charge.
6;3;Bethic Twinstinct;Summer;Wow Dad, good job.
6;3;Bethic Twinstinct;Jerry;Rick, put some pants on. Today has so few rules.
6;3;Bethic Twinstinct;Rick;Yes, Patriarch.
6;3;Bethic Twinstinct;Jerry;I'd like to make a toast. Today is a day for thanks. And for family. And for remembering all of those that have less.
6;3;Bethic Twinstinct;Rick;Okay, pick a scope.
6;3;Bethic Twinstinct;Jerry;Pick a scope?
6;3;Bethic Twinstinct;Beth;Can we please have a normal Thanksgiving?
6;3;Bethic Twinstinct;Space Beth;Well seems like all the ones I remember.
6;3;Bethic Twinstinct;Beth;Good point.
6;3;Bethic Twinstinct;Jerry;Baby, you, it's a toast.
6;3;Bethic Twinstinct;Beth;Sorry!
6;3;Bethic Twinstinct;Space Beth;Sorry!
6;3;Bethic Twinstinct;Jerry;Anyway, I'm thankful for my wife. Beth. The Beth that chose me. I'm so grateful to you, and I literally could not live without you.
6;3;Bethic Twinstinct;Beth;Aw!
6;3;Bethic Twinstinct;Morty;Aw!
6;3;Bethic Twinstinct;Summer;Aw!
6;3;Bethic Twinstinct;Jerry;I really mean that. If something were to happen to you, or if you were to leave me, or be unfaithful, I would die. 
6;3;Bethic Twinstinct;Beth;Mmm. Uh...
6;3;Bethic Twinstinct;Jerry;Literally. Probably by my own hand.
6;3;Bethic Twinstinct;Summer;Eww...
6;3;Bethic Twinstinct;Morty;Okay.
6;3;Bethic Twinstinct;Jerry;I know how I'd do it. Our first blender has an extra long cord and it was manufactured before safety fuses, so I'd draw a warm bath...
6;3;Bethic Twinstinct;Beth;And blend some stuff, good toast, honey. To thankfulness.
6;3;Bethic Twinstinct;Morty;To... America?
6;3;Bethic Twinstinct;Rick;To ending the toast?
6;3;Bethic Twinstinct;Summer;To ending the toast.
6;3;Bethic Twinstinct;Morty;To ending the toast.
6;3;Bethic Twinstinct;Beth;To ending the toast.
6;3;Bethic Twinstinct;Space Beth;To ending the toast.
6;3;Bethic Twinstinct;Jerry;Just to, be clear, I was saying I'd kill myself.
6;3;Bethic Twinstinct;Beth;Jerry!
6;3;Bethic Twinstinct;Summer;God.
6;3;Bethic Twinstinct;Morty;We know!
6;3;Bethic Twinstinct;Beth;Sorry Jerry got all husband-y.
6;3;Bethic Twinstinct;Space Beth;Yeah. Do not miss that.
6;3;Bethic Twinstinct;Beth;So I was thinking we could set you up in Jerry's man cave?
6;3;Bethic Twinstinct;Space Beth;That's okay, I'll sleep in my car. It's got a TARDIS thing going on, bigger on the inside. Dad calls it hack, but my soaking tub begs to differ.
6;3;Bethic Twinstinct;Beth;Hmm, maybe I'll trade you. Ohh! Agh! My lower back.
6;3;Bethic Twinstinct;Space Beth;Oh, I got this.
6;3;Bethic Twinstinct;Beth;Ah, Jesus, that was great.
6;3;Bethic Twinstinct;Space Beth;Well, you're me. I find this is usually the biggest help.
6;3;Bethic Twinstinct;Beth;Mmm, oh, I just love... the Venusian stuff.
6;3;Bethic Twinstinct;Space Beth;It's cool, I get insecure trying to pronounce this crap too, but I got just the thing for that. Here.
6;3;Bethic Twinstinct;Rick;Okay shoot that asteroid. Now shoot that one.
6;3;Bethic Twinstinct;Summer;Now shoot me in the face. This game's trash.
6;3;Bethic Twinstinct;Morty;I didn't want to say anything, but this does seem lame.
6;3;Bethic Twinstinct;Rick;Yeah, I thought it was maybe cause we've shot so many real asteroids. L-let's look at the menu.
6;3;Bethic Twinstinct;Morty;Oh! T-There's the realism setting.
6;3;Bethic Twinstinct;Rick;Oh, cool. Also stupid. The factory setting is 4? What do we want, 10?
6;3;Bethic Twinstinct;Summer;No, do 9. I'm kidding.
6;3;Bethic Twinstinct;Rick;Shut up, Summer.
6;3;Bethic Twinstinct;Morty;Yeah, shut up Summer. Put 10.
6;3;Bethic Twinstinct;Morty;This is the same.
6;3;Bethic Twinstinct;Rick;It's worse. It's... Oh. Oh. I get it. Okay. It's... It's more real. The vast majority of space is empty.
6;3;Bethic Twinstinct;Morty;What? Who cares? T-Then what am I doing?
6;3;Bethic Twinstinct;Rick;Looks like you can record a video for your kid in case you die. Not a bad idea, you're gonna be in space for a while.
6;3;Bethic Twinstinct;Morty;May as well. Um, hey, son. If you're seeing this, I starved to death while looking for an asteroid.
6;3;Bethic Twinstinct;Summer;Ugh. This is stupid. You guys are obviously just trying to convince yourselves it's cool because you feel lame about it.
6;3;Bethic Twinstinct;Rick;Summer you know nothing about gamer culture. Bro, tell your son you love the shit out of him.
6;3;Bethic Twinstinct;Morty;Oh, I'm gonna!
6;3;Bethic Twinstinct;Beth;Of course we both can't sleep at the same time.
6;3;Bethic Twinstinct;Space Beth;Yeah, we do share a shitty back.
6;3;Bethic Twinstinct;Beth;Turn around. At least let me...
6;3;Bethic Twinstinct;Space Beth;Yes please. Oh, my God.
6;3;Bethic Twinstinct;Beth;Okay, I know we're not massage people but you need this. See you act like this bad ass space cowboy but I know you're just a scared little overachiever that keeps all her OCD right...
6;3;Bethic Twinstinct;Space Beth;Oh, my God!
6;3;Bethic Twinstinct;Beth;Yeah. By the way you better be taking notes, I'm next.
6;3;Bethic Twinstinct;Space Beth;It's my back, you dumb bitch.
6;3;Bethic Twinstinct;Beth;Nice. What?
6;3;Bethic Twinstinct;Beth;Well I better get back to bed.
6;3;Bethic Twinstinct;Space Beth;Yep. Same.
6;3;Bethic Twinstinct;Morty;Oh, so now you're into highly realistic video games?
6;3;Bethic Twinstinct;Summer;Maybe I decided real life was too much right now, or maybe I'm not afraid to change my mind about stuff. Maybe mental flexibility is stronger than stubbornness.
6;3;Bethic Twinstinct;Rick;Nice manip', Sum-Sum. Okay, I'm in the alley behind the library.
6;3;Bethic Twinstinct;Summer;Uptown or downtown?
6;3;Bethic Twinstinct;Rick;Shit, there's one uptown, too?
6;3;Bethic Twinstinct;Summer;It's okay, stay there, I think I'm near the red line.
6;3;Bethic Twinstinct;Morty;"Is this Street Fighter""?"""
6;3;Bethic Twinstinct;Summer;"Street Fighter"" where you start at the beginning of each fighter's day and have to find each other to fight."""
6;3;Bethic Twinstinct;Rick;It's very realistic. Not even guaranteed a fight will happen. That meter filling up is us forgetting what made us so mad.
6;3;Bethic Twinstinct;Jerry;"If anyone's interested in a higher level of realism, I'm booting up"" the O.G.. That's Original Game, called a jigsaw puzzle, in the den."""
6;3;Bethic Twinstinct;Beth;Hey, gang! Me and my space self are gonna make a run to the Gloppy Drop System for ice cream. Any flavor requests?
6;3;Bethic Twinstinct;Jerry;Vanilla!
6;3;Bethic Twinstinct;Morty;Vanilla!
6;3;Bethic Twinstinct;Summer;Why do you guys have to go all the way to deep space just for ice cream?
6;3;Bethic Twinstinct;Rick;Gloppy Dropulites have less taste buds than humans, their ice cream is like a hospital bed. It's designed for you to do less so it does more.
6;3;Bethic Twinstinct;Beth;Okay, see ya in a bit.
6;3;Bethic Twinstinct;Jerry;I'll get started sorting all the obvious sky pieces. Secret technique.
6;3;Bethic Twinstinct;Summer;Oh fuck it's ON, bitch!
6;3;Bethic Twinstinct;Rick;Oh shit there you are! I'm gonna eat your ass!
6;3;Bethic Twinstinct;Summer;You will die in the street like a dog!
6;3;Bethic Twinstinct;Beth;Stunning. Thank you. This is incredible.
6;3;Bethic Twinstinct;Space Beth;Eh. Just glad I had something in your size.
6;3;Bethic Twinstinct;Beth;How far is Gloppy Drop? And why do I always think I'm wearing a watch?
6;3;Bethic Twinstinct;Space Beth;I actually have a pint of Gloppy Drop on a little apartment orbiting Earth. So we have time.
6;3;Bethic Twinstinct;Beth;You have your own space station?
6;3;Bethic Twinstinct;Space Beth;We have our own space station. We're the same person. 
6;3;Bethic Twinstinct;Beth;There's differences. Like, one of us has no idea who she really is.
6;3;Bethic Twinstinct;Space Beth;Wrong. But let's make a deal. Let's trust ourselves enough to stop wondering who we are when we're together. We get to say anything to each other. Things we'd never say to anyone else, even ourselves.
6;3;Bethic Twinstinct;Beth;What don't we say to ourselves?
6;3;Bethic Twinstinct;Space Beth;"How about, Wow, my ass looks good in that space suit""? I mean it. I'm a good looking woman."""
6;3;Bethic Twinstinct;Beth;Well, that's nice of you to say. I also... find myself... quite attractive.
6;3;Bethic Twinstinct;Beth;We forgot the ice cream.
6;3;Bethic Twinstinct;Space Beth;I want you back in my guts like I'm one of your sick little fillies.
6;3;Bethic Twinstinct;Rick;Oh, Goddammit, Morty! You can't just take my controller.
6;3;Bethic Twinstinct;Morty;Yes I can! It's mine!
6;3;Bethic Twinstinct;Rick;Ugh. Okay, Sum-Sum, gimme.
6;3;Bethic Twinstinct;Summer;Make your own controller, some of us need all the control we can get.
6;3;Bethic Twinstinct;Rick;Ugh, fuck you!
6;3;Bethic Twinstinct;Summer;So why are you so suddenly into realistic video games?
6;3;Bethic Twinstinct;Morty;I already was.
6;3;Bethic Twinstinct;Summer;But now you're into them the way I am.
6;3;Bethic Twinstinct;Morty;You mean, like staring at them in a numb trance?
6;3;Bethic Twinstinct;Summer;Uh-huh. Not judging, just noticing.
6;3;Bethic Twinstinct;Morty;Yeah, y-you tend to notice stuff a little before I do.
6;3;Bethic Twinstinct;Summer;But eventually you do notice.
6;3;Bethic Twinstinct;Morty;And now we can both not notice together, yes.
6;3;Bethic Twinstinct;Jerry;Oh, my god... Beth?! I thought you said you got ice cream?
6;3;Bethic Twinstinct;Beth;Yeah, I, uh... It must be in the...
6;3;Bethic Twinstinct;Space Beth;Oh, the car! We left it in the car.
6;3;Bethic Twinstinct;Jerry;Okay, good, because that would have been weird!
6;3;Bethic Twinstinct;Morty;I worry things might become more and more noticeable.
6;3;Bethic Twinstinct;Summer;Yeah, and if he kills himself, we're gonna have to get a new dad.
6;3;Bethic Twinstinct;Morty;Jesus Christ, Summer!
6;3;Bethic Twinstinct;Beth;Hey, Dad. Um, hmm, what's this?
6;3;Bethic Twinstinct;Rick;Making a controller. This species of bionic space whale has carbon wiring, great for smooth gameplay. I'm not killing it, for the record. I'm just replacing its esophagus with a better one. For free. I-It should thank me. And it will, with its mind. These things are telepathic, Beth, they talk to you in dreams.
6;3;Bethic Twinstinct;Beth;Does your replicator thing make ice cream from the Gloppy Drop system?
6;3;Bethic Twinstinct;Rick;Why would you want replicated Gloppy Drop ice cream, poser?
6;3;Bethic Twinstinct;Beth;Crazy thing, I went with Space Beth to get some and we had such a great time we forgot the ice cream! Crazy, right?
6;3;Bethic Twinstinct;Rick;That's a real question?
6;3;Bethic Twinstinct;Beth;Maybe?
6;3;Bethic Twinstinct;Rick;Come here, hold the pup down.
6;3;Bethic Twinstinct;Rick;You're talking about an infinite father. I've met myself out there infinite times... Infinite shit happens. Including, as you put it, forgetting the ice cream.
6;3;Bethic Twinstinct;Beth;You've... forgotten the ice cream?
6;3;Bethic Twinstinct;Rick;Drill me for details when I'm drunker. In the meantime, don't worry about what's crazy. Y'know, as the kids say, you do you.
6;3;Bethic Twinstinct;Beth;Oh, thanks. Thank you so much, Dad.
6;3;Bethic Twinstinct;Rick;One thing to keep in mind, though. It's not just your own ice cream you're forgetting. It's your family's. If you forget it too much, you start having to keep secrets.
6;3;Bethic Twinstinct;Beth;Oh, and you're against secrets?
6;3;Bethic Twinstinct;Rick;Against? Hell no. Secrets are great. For instance, I've had a pint of vanilla Gloppy Drop in my fridge this whole time. Take it. I'm just saying, lies pile up. Like credit card debt. You retain an advantage by staying liquid.
6;3;Bethic Twinstinct;Beth;Gotcha. Well. I'd call this a simple cash transaction. Fun. And. Done.
6;3;Bethic Twinstinct;Space Beth;Favorite Culkin?
6;3;Bethic Twinstinct;Beth;Kieran!
6;3;Bethic Twinstinct;Space Beth;Kieran!
6;3;Bethic Twinstinct;Beth;Favorite song by Britney?
6;3;Bethic Twinstinct;Space Beth;Work Bitch!
6;3;Bethic Twinstinct;Beth;Work Bitch!
6;3;Bethic Twinstinct;Space Beth;Favorite hangover cure?
6;3;Bethic Twinstinct;Beth;"Hair of the dog with a guilty pleasure like Us Weekly""."""
6;3;Bethic Twinstinct;Space Beth;"Hair of the dog with a guilty pleasure like Humans Weekly""."""
6;3;Bethic Twinstinct;Beth;I told Dad. I mean I didn't have to. He knew.
6;3;Bethic Twinstinct;Space Beth;I guess that's one reason you didn't have to tell him. What'd he say?
6;3;Bethic Twinstinct;Beth;We kind of talked in code, I think he said it's fine until it makes us feel indebted to our lessers.
6;3;Bethic Twinstinct;Space Beth;That sounds like Dad.
6;3;Bethic Twinstinct;Beth;Do... we... owe... the family an explanation?
6;3;Bethic Twinstinct;Space Beth;Do we have to spend our time together figuring out how to please others?
6;3;Bethic Twinstinct;Beth;I'm married. We both are, but I'm in our marriage. It's the defining difference between us.
6;3;Bethic Twinstinct;Space Beth;Well there's no rule book that says you have to be.
6;3;Bethic Twinstinct;Beth;What's gonna happen? What is this? Are we in love? With ourself? I mean, does that make us the most or the least healthy woman in the universe?
6;3;Bethic Twinstinct;Space Beth;Anybody ever tell you you're overly analytical? Which I do love? If that's what you need to call it.
6;3;Bethic Twinstinct;Beth;I don't need to call it anything. I would like to know... its shelf life.
6;3;Bethic Twinstinct;Space Beth;I might know a way to gather that data.
6;3;Bethic Twinstinct;Space Beth;The Holodeck!
6;3;Bethic Twinstinct;Beth;Motel Room! I like yours better.
6;3;Bethic Twinstinct;Jerry;"Hmm... Uh... Beth! Uh, m-my Beth! Well, not my"" Beth, but... I finished! It's done! """
6;3;Bethic Twinstinct;Jerry;Kids do you know where your moms are? Oh you're busy with your GamePod. Don't worry about it, I'll find those two somewhere.
6;3;Bethic Twinstinct;Summer;No! No, dad, come play videogames with us! Okay, Dad, here's the infinite menu screen.
6;3;Bethic Twinstinct;Jerry;Oh, I dunno.
6;3;Bethic Twinstinct;Morty;Here, here, I-I'll have the console choose a game!
6;3;Bethic Twinstinct;Summer;Uh, maybe let's skip this one?
6;3;Bethic Twinstinct;Jerry;Really? Why? Looks fun! Oh, okay, so we are a woman married to a man but having a sexual affair with another woman! Very spicy.
6;3;Bethic Twinstinct;Rick;Very spicy, Jer. Good job. Looks pretty single player, kids?
6;3;Bethic Twinstinct;Rick;"Seriously you two?! What the hell did you do in my holodeck?! Holy shit, you did a full San Junipero"" in here? Oh, my god, Beth, there's masturbating and then there's masturbating."""
6;3;Bethic Twinstinct;Beth;Ew, Dad stop, I'm sorry!
6;3;Bethic Twinstinct;Space Beth;You'd know, old man.
6;3;Bethic Twinstinct;Rick;Argh! Look, this isn't my business and by all means, enjoy being sapphic horse girls together. But you suck at doing it secretly. We all know.
6;3;Bethic Twinstinct;Beth;Including Jerry?!
6;3;Bethic Twinstinct;Summer;No, Dad's so in the dark that he's enjoying a video game about being in an affair right now.
6;3;Bethic Twinstinct;Morty;If you guys are doing this, you gotta tell him!
6;3;Bethic Twinstinct;Space Beth;Okay, little man, back off.
6;3;Bethic Twinstinct;Beth;Take it easy. They're right.
6;3;Bethic Twinstinct;Space Beth;Right about what, that we have to be twice as considerate and twice as repressed because some dick split us in two? This is the shit I left. This isn't. This is me. This is the me that doesn't tell you all to fuck off. So allow me. Fuck off. She'll tell her husband what she wants when she feels like it. And you can deal with it or you can deal with me. But you should know I have all the Predator weapons.
6;3;Bethic Twinstinct;Rick;Works for me.
6;3;Bethic Twinstinct;Morty;That's cool.
6;3;Bethic Twinstinct;Summer;Fair enough.
6;3;Bethic Twinstinct;Rick;I guess it's time for ice cream.
6;3;Bethic Twinstinct;Jerry;Come on, kids, you're inhaling this stuff. Your Moms went to space, did you even thank them for doing it?
6;3;Bethic Twinstinct;Morty;Thanks for... doing it, Moms.
6;3;Bethic Twinstinct;Summer;Very selfless of you. 
6;3;Bethic Twinstinct;Beth;Eat your ice cream however you want. Nothing good lasts forever.
6;3;Bethic Twinstinct;Jerry;Okay, c'mon, it's Thanksgiving, the least we can do is speak English.
6;3;Bethic Twinstinct;Space Beth;Jerry, I had sex with your wife. Or, I'm your wife and had sex with the clone you sleep with. Your pick. We had sex. We loved it.
6;3;Bethic Twinstinct;Teen Jerry;Beth Sanchez sure is something, huh? I think I'll ask her to prom.
6;3;Bethic Twinstinct;Teen Pal;Jerry. For your own sake. Stay away from Beth Sanchez.
6;3;Bethic Twinstinct;Teen Jerry;"Worst case, she says no""."""
6;3;Bethic Twinstinct;Teen Pal;"No, Jerry. Worst case she says yes"". She's too much woman for you. Maybe she'd find your simple naïveté endearing, but she's intense. Sooner or later, she'd tear you apart."""
6;3;Bethic Twinstinct;Teen Jerry;I'd be lucky to be torn apart by Beth Sanchez.
6;3;Bethic Twinstinct;Beth;Aah! 
6;3;Bethic Twinstinct;Morty;What the fuck?!
6;3;Bethic Twinstinct;Summer;Dad's a bug! Dad rolled into a bug!
6;3;Bethic Twinstinct;Rick;Oh, yeah. Sh... Forgot I installed that.
6;3;Bethic Twinstinct;Beth;Why does Jerry have a Pill Bug Protocol?
6;3;Bethic Twinstinct;Rick;"It's an emotional defense system. I got drunk with Jerry one night and he said it's what he wanted most in the world. Don't blame me, I wanted tattoos. Anyway, he's in perfect health in there and he can unroll when he chooses to but can also stay in metabolic hibernation pretty much indefinitely. It's a cool power to have, like if you have to fly coach or if Summer asks you what you thought of Wonder Woman 1984""."""
6;3;Bethic Twinstinct;Beth;How do we undo it?
6;3;Bethic Twinstinct;Rick;Only he can. That's the point. It's total safety. Even I can't reverse it. If you try to pry him out and hit a nerve, he'll literally turn into a Shrek. In his own sad way, he's taken control.
6;3;Bethic Twinstinct;Space Beth;This is classic Jerry. He'd rather be a bug than have a conversation.
6;3;Bethic Twinstinct;Beth;Oh, have you heard the way you start conversations?
6;3;Bethic Twinstinct;Rick;You ladies discuss responsibility while I get stoned and play video games with your kids.
6;3;Bethic Twinstinct;Rick;Fuck! More forest!
6;3;Bethic Twinstinct;Morty;L-Look around!
6;3;Bethic Twinstinct;Summer;Try heading North.
6;3;Bethic Twinstinct;Morty;Oh shit.
6;3;Bethic Twinstinct;Rick;Wait, what the fuck?
6;3;Bethic Twinstinct;Summer;Um, maybe keep heading North? Ew, what the hell?!
6;3;Bethic Twinstinct;Morty;Oh, God, what happens in the shadows?
6;3;Bethic Twinstinct;Beth;Jerry, sweetie, If you can hear me, please, unroll.
6;3;Bethic Twinstinct;Space Beth;He doesn't want to.
6;3;Bethic Twinstinct;Beth;It's a little late to worry about what he wants.
6;3;Bethic Twinstinct;Space Beth;Jesus, Beth, don't fall for this. This isn't love, it's a tantrum.
6;3;Bethic Twinstinct;Beth;Yeah, but his tantrum is self-destructive. Yours is destructive. Maybe that's why I'm the one that loves him. He worries. He wants to do right. He's ashamed when he fails. Aren't those things you love about me?
6;3;Bethic Twinstinct;Space Beth;You want me to be like him? You want me to propose? Threaten to kill myself?
6;3;Bethic Twinstinct;Beth;No. I love you the way you are. And I did it forever in a video game. But in life, things go wrong. Things stop working. I like to fix those things, and when I can't, I'm pretty useless. Like my husband.
6;3;Bethic Twinstinct;Space Beth;I don't get it. You're the house wife and I'm the space lady, but you're the one that chewed me up and spit me out. I don't want to just forget about you.
6;3;Bethic Twinstinct;Beth;Me neither. It's a problem. But we know someone that owes us a solution.
6;3;Bethic Twinstinct;Rick;Oh, shit, we're out of the forest! We found a clearing!
6;3;Bethic Twinstinct;Summer;Go check it out! Go check out the clearing!
6;3;Bethic Twinstinct;Morty;Vampires?! Oh, come on! That's not realistic!
6;3;Bethic Twinstinct;Rick;Morty, it's obviously set in a world where vampires hunt in clearings.
6;3;Bethic Twinstinct;Morty;How did you...
6;3;Bethic Twinstinct;Rick;I'm working with the same information you are! Ow!
6;3;Bethic Twinstinct;Space Beth;No more screen time until your homework's done, Dad.
6;3;Bethic Twinstinct;Summer;What did that mean?
6;3;Bethic Twinstinct;Morty;We refuse to care.
6;3;Bethic Twinstinct;Summer;Damn. You really came of age this Thanksgiving.
6;3;Bethic Twinstinct;Morty;How old are we? We've had a million Thanksgivings.
6;3;Bethic Twinstinct;Rick;Can I explain how irrational this is?
6;3;Bethic Twinstinct;Beth;Asked the guy that cloned his daughter.
6;3;Bethic Twinstinct;Rick;Will I ever live that down?
6;3;Bethic Twinstinct;Space Beth;No.
6;3;Bethic Twinstinct;Beth;No.
6;3;Bethic Twinstinct;Rick;"You guys are having me Eternal Sunshine"" all the ""Multiplicity"" porn scenes from your minds?"""
6;3;Bethic Twinstinct;Space Beth;Yep. Basically.
6;3;Bethic Twinstinct;Beth;Sounds right.
6;3;Bethic Twinstinct;Rick;Meanwhile, everyone around you, your father, your cuckhold husband, your jaded children... Will just happily and silently bear the burden because it's more practical for them than the truth and you don't care because it won't be your problem?
6;3;Bethic Twinstinct;Space Beth;Solid repipe, Dad.
6;3;Bethic Twinstinct;Beth;It's like he has a lifetime of experience as a selfish ass.
6;3;Bethic Twinstinct;Rick;When this fails and the two of you fall in love again and you attack me for taking part in this, I'm gonna lie and say I tried to talk you out of it for hours. In truth, I don't care. Three, two...
6;3;Bethic Twinstinct;Jerry;Oh, for God's sake, all of you, grow up.
6;3;Bethic Twinstinct;Beth;Jerry! You unrolled!
6;3;Bethic Twinstinct;Space Beth;What the hell?
6;3;Bethic Twinstinct;Rick;Ooh, plot twist, Deus Ex Husbanda.
6;3;Bethic Twinstinct;Jerry;Oh, don't lobotomize yourselves for my comfort. I may be a man, but I'm also a baby, and babies don't take responsibility for other people's suffering. I should never have said I'd kill myself if you left me. It's not true. All I'd do is pack my shit and cry, while I look for a job on Starbuck's wifi. And that's what I'm gonna do. So the two of you can get clone lesbian married by a robot and finger yourselves on the moon while laughing in Martian French about my weird little dick!
6;3;Bethic Twinstinct;Beth;Jerry, wait!
6;3;Bethic Twinstinct;Beth;Jerry, don't leave angry.
6;3;Bethic Twinstinct;Jerry;Should I float out on a lotus leaf? I have to be twice as confident because my wife cheated on me with herself?
6;3;Bethic Twinstinct;Space Beth;It's not even cheating.
6;3;Bethic Twinstinct;Jerry;Oh, you here to help? You suck.
6;3;Bethic Twinstinct;Space Beth;You don't even know which one is your real wife. If it's me, have you been cheating with a clone?
6;3;Bethic Twinstinct;Beth;I'm not the clone, but she has a point.
6;3;Bethic Twinstinct;Jerry;Oh, what a provocative conversation it would've been great to have before the two of you, and I am counting two, gave each other unfairly expert orgasms while mocking my weird little dick!
6;3;Bethic Twinstinct;Beth;"Jerry, you're the only one who keeps saying weird"" and ""little""."""
6;3;Bethic Twinstinct;Jerry;Well you've both seen it! And you've both seen each other, and now you want to tell me all about it, but it's a little late.
6;3;Bethic Twinstinct;Space Beth;Oh, my God. You're not mad that it was about you. You're mad that it wasn't. He wanted to permit our love.
6;3;Bethic Twinstinct;Jerry;"Okay it's not Handmaid's Tale"" to loop in your husband."""
6;3;Bethic Twinstinct;Beth;I agree, for the record. We made a mistake.
6;3;Bethic Twinstinct;Space Beth;"Oh, because we should've noticed ourselves losing control and gone to Sexmaster Jerry and said Oh, pretty please, Jerry, can I make out with myself?""."""
6;3;Bethic Twinstinct;Jerry;Yes you may. Yeah, see. Not so hot when it's above board. Homewreckers.
6;3;Bethic Twinstinct;Space Beth;Oh, so we won't enjoy this?
6;3;Bethic Twinstinct;Beth;Well, hold on, hold on, this is weird.
6;3;Bethic Twinstinct;Jerry;Weird and permitted.
6;3;Bethic Twinstinct;Beth;Wait, you like this?
6;3;Bethic Twinstinct;Space Beth;Who cares what he likes.
6;3;Bethic Twinstinct;Beth;I do.
6;3;Bethic Twinstinct;Jerry;I might like it. And if she likes it, I permit it.
6;3;Bethic Twinstinct;Space Beth;You little pervert.
6;3;Bethic Twinstinct;Jerry;You like a little pervert.
6;3;Bethic Twinstinct;Space Beth;I like humiliating a little pervert.
6;3;Bethic Twinstinct;Jerry;I approve. Carry on.
6;3;Bethic Twinstinct;Beth;I'm freaked out by how hot this is. Am I permitted to do this?
6;3;Bethic Twinstinct;Jerry;Until further notice.
6;3;Bethic Twinstinct;Beth;I love it.
6;3;Bethic Twinstinct;Jerry;Then it's permitted from now on.
6;3;Bethic Twinstinct;Space Beth;Oh, because you like whatever she likes. Because you're a worm.
6;3;Bethic Twinstinct;Jerry;I will allow that assessment.
6;3;Bethic Twinstinct;Summer;Pass the salt?
6;3;Bethic Twinstinct;Morty;Dammit.
6;3;Bethic Twinstinct;Beth;I allow this.
6;3;Bethic Twinstinct;Space Beth;Well, then it's required.
6;3;Bethic Twinstinct;Jerry;I approve the requirement.
6;3;Bethic Twinstinct;Space Beth;You get over there.
6;3;Bethic Twinstinct;Jerry;Good idea.
6;3;Bethic Twinstinct;Beth;Oh, wow. Okay. Uh, Honey?
6;3;Bethic Twinstinct;Jerry;I'm fine if you are.
6;3;Bethic Twinstinct;Space Beth;You're never fine, shut up.
6;3;Bethic Twinstinct;Jerry;Okay but... Whoa! Okay.
6;3;Bethic Twinstinct;Beth;This is not how I pictured this but...
6;3;Bethic Twinstinct;Jerry;I have zero complaints so far.
6;3;Bethic Twinstinct;Space Beth;Because I know what you want.
6;3;Bethic Twinstinct;Jerry;I do not disagree with that.
6;3;Bethic Twinstinct;Beth;Can I make a pitch? What if we...
6;3;Bethic Twinstinct;Space Beth;Are you serious?
6;3;Bethic Twinstinct;Jerry;Hey, is... Is this making fun of me?
6;3;Bethic Twinstinct;Space Beth;Well is that bad?
6;3;Bethic Twinstinct;Jerry;I'll allow it.
6;3;Bethic Twinstinct;Morty;Jesus Christ, you need to fix the portal gun, Rick!
6;3;Bethic Twinstinct;Rick;Morty, you asking makes me wanna do it less. Okay, uh, Thanksgiving! Let's talk about Thanksgiving! Who's thankful for what? Go, Summer, you first.
6;3;Bethic Twinstinct;Summer;I guess I'm thankful, for like, water?
6;3;Bethic Twinstinct;Rick;Perfect! Wonderful! Morty, what about you?
6;3;Bethic Twinstinct;Morty;F-F-Fucking. Are you fucking kidding me? Why? Why? Discovery Channel! Discovery Channel, why?!
6;3;Bethic Twinstinct;Rick;Okay. Just, eat your food. Everyone eat the food.
6;3;Bethic Twinstinct;Jerry;Sorry, I'm... this... Is this? Ohh!
6;3;Bethic Twinstinct;Space Beth;Well, bye kids! I'll keep an eye out for my grandkid in space.
6;3;Bethic Twinstinct;Morty;"Your what? Oh! Right. Naruto""."""
6;3;Bethic Twinstinct;Beth;Thanks for visiting, Space Beth.
6;3;Bethic Twinstinct;Jerry;Well, seems like we all learned a little lesson this weekend! At least, I know I did!
6;3;Bethic Twinstinct;Rick;Me too, Jerry. Me too.
6;3;Bethic Twinstinct;Jerry-Sitter;Hello there, Jerry! How can I help you today?
6;3;Bethic Twinstinct;Jerry;Howdy! Yeah, just, uh... Just here to hang!
6;3;Bethic Twinstinct;Jerry-Sitter;Oh, I'm sorry, sweetie. You can't come here by yourself.
6;3;Bethic Twinstinct;Jerry;Why not? It's just me in there!
6;3;Bethic Twinstinct;Jerry-Sitter;Well, not that this is something you'd do, but sometimes we have Jerries come here and try to touch other Jerries.
6;3;Bethic Twinstinct;Jerry;Oh, no, that's... That's not good. Uh, well, see you later!
6;3;Bethic Twinstinct;Jerry;Okay. Thank you!
6;4;Night Family;Beth;Ahh! What are you doing... Dad? Dad? Hello? What is wrong with you? Really? Oh. Okay.
6;4;Night Family;Rick;Morning, assholes. What's this? Pancakes? Sold.
6;4;Night Family;Beth;What was up with you last night? I was totally talking to you and you acted like I wasn't there.
6;4;Night Family;Rick;I did? Oh, yeah. No, that wasn't me. Technically. That was my Night Person. Been having him do crunches while I sleep. Check it.
6;4;Night Family;Morty;Damn! Check out that washboard, yo!
6;4;Night Family;Jerry;Hey. Too hard.
6;4;Night Family;Summer;What the hell's a night person?
6;4;Night Family;Rick;I nabbed a Somnambulator while passing through the Goobie-Joob System last week. Best investment I've ever made. Before going to bed, I type a list of shit I wanna get done, then the Somnambulator programs my unconscious body, or Night Person, to do it while I sleep. I'm getting so much done.
6;4;Night Family;Morty;C-can my Night-Person get me an ab stack like yours, Rick?
6;4;Night Family;Summer;I'm gonna have my Night-Person learn me Spanish so I can pass my test next week!
6;4;Night Family;Rick;Hey, hey, hey! No one gets a Night Person but me.
6;4;Night Family;Morty;Aw!
6;4;Night Family;Rick;This tech is way too advanced for you zeebs. 
6;4;Night Family;Rick;What?
6;4;Night Family;Summer;Nothing.
6;4;Night Family;Rick;No. Go on. Say it.
6;4;Night Family;Summer;Say what? I don't know what you're talking about.
6;4;Night Family;Rick;Okay. Fine. Fuck it. Everybody gets a Night-Person. Whatever. Stick out your fingers. It needs a blood sample.
6;4;Night Family;Jerry;Blood? Can't I just give it Beth's credit card number?
6;4;Night Family;Rick;This isn't Postmates, Jerry. The Somnambulator needs your DNA profile to send commands to your subconscious.
6;4;Night Family;Morty;It can poke all the fingers I got if I get abs like Rick.
6;4;Night Family;Beth;Well, looks like I'm learning the trumpet.
6;4;Night Family;Jerry;Okay remember, somebody has to catch me if I faint.
6;4;Night Family;Summer;Yay! Night-Family!
6;4;Night Family;Morty;Whooo!
6;4;Night Family;Jerry;Oh. I'm fainting.
6;4;Night Family;Summer;Hola, mamá. ¿Cómo lo llevas?
6;4;Night Family;Beth;How's my honor student doing?
6;4;Night Family;Summer;Muy bien. All the niños and niñas at school think I should run for class presidenta.
6;4;Night Family;Morty;'Sup, ladies. Wanna see somethin'? Summer, you wanna drop this bowling ball on my abs?
6;4;Night Family;Summer;Hell yeah, I'm only human.
6;4;Night Family;Morty;Watch this.
6;4;Night Family;Rick;'Sup, ladies. You ready, Morty? The stream's about to go live.
6;4;Night Family;Beth;Where are you two going?
6;4;Night Family;Rick;"Morty and I started a podcast we call Fab-solutely Ab-ulous."" It's, an ab-centric hour of fun. """
6;4;Night Family;Morty;Hoping to get Nancy Pelosi on the show next week, wanna drop her on our abs.
6;4;Night Family;Rick;Yeah!
6;4;Night Family;Jerry;Guess who has a new pen pal. No takers? It's me.
6;4;Night Family;Beth;Pen pal?
6;4;Night Family;Jerry;Night-Jerry and I write letters to each other. It's super fun.
6;4;Night Family;Summer;"I also like Tori Amos"", ""Hope you like our new pajamas."""""
6;4;Night Family;Beth;"What is the sun?"" Jerry, this isn't how you're supposed to use a Night-Person."""
6;4;Night Family;Jerry;You two are being a couple of Debbie Down-theres. Wait until Night-Jerry reads about this.
6;4;Night Family;Morty;Who wants cake?
6;4;Night Family;Morty;Abs are cool.
6;4;Night Family;Rick;Way cool.
6;4;Night Family;Morty;But as above so below, know what I'm saying, Rick?
6;4;Night Family;Rick;Morty, you must be referring to these excellent boxer shorts we got from the good folks at Boxer Lobster.
6;4;Night Family;Morty;Boxer Lobster Boxers feel like they're warm butter on your schwantz.
6;4;Night Family;Rick ;And they come in all sorts of styles. Neon, plaid, orange I even got a pair with that little, the raccoon man from that one movie, printed on it.
6;4;Night Family;Morty;Chewbacca.
6;4;Night Family;Rick;Do yourself a favor and level up with Boxer Lobster Boxers. You'll be glad you did.
6;4;Night Family;Morty;Oh, shit, Rick, they want you to say Wub-a-lubba-dub-dub at the end.
6;4;Night Family;Rick;Screw that. We're not whores.
6;4;Night Family;Jerry;Guys, dinner's getting cold.
6;4;Night Family;Morty;You know what's not getting cold? This hot stack of ab-jacks, son. Pow! Pow! Pow! Pow! Pow! P-Pow!
6;4;Night Family;Rick;No notes.
6;4;Night Family;Jerry;Oh! One more thing. Night-Jerry said Night-Summer would appreciate it if everybody could rinse off their plates after eating.
6;4;Night Family;Rick;What?
6;4;Night Family;Jerry;Ya know, rinse the schmutz off after eating. Makes it easier to clean up later. What?
6;4;Night Family;Rick;Our job is not to make the Night People's chores easier.
6;4;Night Family;Jerry;It's a reasonable request, Rick. Takes two seconds.
6;4;Night Family;Rick;They exist only to do the shit we don't want to do. So, until further notice, which will be never. Request denied.
6;4;Night Family;Rick;Hello there. What the cock? Where are the dishes?
6;4;Night Family;Beth;Uh, dad? They're in here.
6;4;Night Family;Summer;They busted up all our dishes. What are we supposed to eat off of now, brains-for-shit?
6;4;Night Family;Rick;You owe me.
6;4;Night Family;Rick;"We'll eat off these, Brains-for-shit""."""
6;4;Night Family;Jerry;Seems like you spent an awful lot of energy just to not give the Night-Family what they want.
6;4;Night Family;Rick;Jerry, tell your boyfriend to suck my dick and good luck breaking super alien dishes.
6;4;Night Family;Jerry;I'll let him know but he's not gonna like it.
6;4;Night Family;Rick;What?
6;4;Night Family;Night-Beth;Why won't you rinse your dishes?
6;4;Night Family;Night-Morty;It takes two seconds.
6;4;Night Family;Night-Jerry;If you don't, the schmutz dries and makes the dish harder to clean.
6;4;Night Family;Night-Beth;Rinse your dishes. Rinse. 
6;4;Night Family;Night-Morty;Rinse.
6;4;Night Family;Night-Jerry;Rinse. Rinse.
6;4;Night Family;Rick;Lemme go, who locked my implants?
6;4;Night Family;Night-Summer;I told you to after you fell asleep. You see, Night-You is not in charge. Night-I am.
6;4;Night Family;Rick;I don't care, I ain't rinsing shit. Hey, what are you doing? 
6;4;Night Family;Night-Summer;If you refuse to clean your dishes. Then I will have to do it for you.
6;4;Night Family;Night-Summer;I have always been here, Rick. Deep inside the mind of your grandchild. Waiting to come out. Your machine allowed me to steal the night, and soon I will seize the day.
6;4;Night Family;Rick;Oh! Baby Jesus! Oh! It's awful, Baby Jesus! Awful!
6;4;Night Family;Rick;What the fuck's your problem with me?
6;4;Night Family;Summer;What? What? I don't know what you're talking about.
6;4;Night Family;Rick;I just got force-fed diarrhea by your night-person, who's also convinced Night-me to lock me out of my tech.
6;4;Night Family;Morty;Uh, Rick? There's been a pretty clear escalation down here. The Night-Family stripped the house last night. Everything's gone. Including the Somnambulator.
6;4;Night Family;Beth;They locked us out of the garage.
6;4;Night Family;Jerry;I don't know about you, but I got the hoo-ha's.
6;4;Night Family;Rick;God-damn it. Are you happy now, Summer?!
6;4;Night Family;Summer;I didn't do anything. I'm trapped in this bullshit too.
6;4;Night Family;Rick;Yeah. Glad you think so, because I got a plan to beat Night-Summer.
6;4;Night Family;Summer;You're going undercover.
6;4;Night Family;Jerry;Did you have to make mushy garbage science on the living room carpet?
6;4;Night Family;Rick;Yeah, no choice, Jerry. Night Summer had Night-Rick take away my tech. Had to improvise.
6;4;Night Family;Rick;There are different levels of cortisol in your bloodstream when you're asleep. So this interface only works off my awake saliva samples
6;4;Night Family;Rick;There. No one asleep will be able to deactivate the laser-cage until I win.
6;4;Night Family;Morty;Where's Summer?
6;4;Night Family;Rick;Never mind her. All of you get to bed.
6;4;Night Family;Summer;It itches, this whole thing is way uncomfortable.
6;4;Night Family;Rick;Yeah, that's the idea. The Sleep Deprivation Suit is designed to keep you awake until morning.
6;4;Night Family;Summer;Aren't they going to be suspicious seeing Night-Summer covered in all this Terry Gilliam?
6;4;Night Family;Rick;They're not gonna question her. She's the leader of the Night Family for some stupid reason. When the Night-Family activates, just blend in, make them think you're Night-Summer. If you start to nod off, suck on this tube.
6;4;Night Family;Summer;What is it?
6;4;Night Family;Rick;A cocktail of Mountain Dew and DayQuil. The kids in Southern Europe call it DewQuil.
6;4;Night Family;Summer;Smells gross.
6;4;Night Family;Rick;It is. Once you find the Somnambulator, use this Deactivator Puck. Stick it on the Somnambulator and when the puck activates it'll fry its circuits. Remember, stay awake. All night. Meet me back here at sunrise.
6;4;Night Family;Night-Rick;Why are you wearing that suit?
6;4;Night Family;Night-Jerry;Yeah, why?
6;4;Night Family;Night-Beth;Yes.
6;4;Night Family;Summer;Yeah. Because you're all such clothing experts.
6;4;Night Family;Night-Rick;That's fair.
6;4;Night Family;Night-Beth;Ouch.
6;4;Night Family;Night-Jerry;Fair enough.
6;4;Night Family;Night-Morty;Point taken.
6;4;Night Family;Summer;Get back to work. I rule the night and stuff.
6;4;Night Family;Night-Rick;Yes.
6;4;Night Family;Night-Beth;Okay.
6;4;Night Family;Night-Jerry;Will do.
6;4;Night Family;Night-Morty;As you wish.
6;4;Night Family;Summer;Grandpa Rick! Rick, wake up!
6;4;Night Family;Rick;What. I'm up. I'm up. Did you find it?
6;4;Night Family;Summer;For sure. You were souping up the Somnambu-whatever so they could extend its range beyond the house. But I defeated that shit when I put the thing on top of the thing.
6;4;Night Family;Rick;Everybody, wake up! Summer fried the Somnambulator. The nightmare is over.
6;4;Night Family;Beth;Really? That's amazing.
6;4;Night Family;Summer;Almost got pinched but yes, say adiós to the Night-Family.
6;4;Night Family;Jerry;Bye-bye, pen pal.
6;4;Night Family;Summer;I want Shoney's pancakes!
6;4;Night Family;Rick;Yes! Shoney's pancakes! Alright, Brunch is on me, Day-Family.
6;4;Night Family;Rick;You know, for a second there, I thought Night-Summer was gonna win. That chick is the absolute worst.
6;4;Night Family;Night-Summer;Sorry, Rick. But your opinion means very little to me. Did you think you could stop me with this, Rick?
6;4;Night Family;Proxy-drone;Halt day-manoids.
6;4;Night Family;Morty;Everyone! Get behind my abs.
6;4;Night Family;Proxy-drone;Do not move. Do not move.
6;4;Night Family;Proxy-drone;You are most definitely surrounded.
6;4;Night Family;Night-Summer;You are the slaves now. If you have any doubt, I suggest you sleep on it.
6;4;Night Family;Jerry;She's Night-Summer!
6;4;Night Family;Beth;Thanks, Jerry.
6;4;Night Family;Proxy-drone;Work! Work! The function of the Daymanoidis to serve the Night. Work Harder! Harder!
6;4;Night Family;Night-Summer;It is natural for the day to serve the night. Night was here long before day. Half of all time is night time.
6;4;Night Family;Proxy-drone;One hundred and fifty-seven. One hundred and fifty-eight. One hundred and...
6;4;Night Family;Morty;No more, please! I hate exercise.
6;4;Night Family;Proxy-drone;Silence! Crunch harder! Harder!
6;4;Night Family;Rick;We have to escape the Somnambulator's reach.
6;4;Night Family;Beth;Do we even know how far that is?
6;4;Night Family;Rick;No. Cards on the table, we may be really eff-ed in the A this time.
6;4;Night Family;Proxy-drone;Report to your designated sleep pod for rest period.
6;4;Night Family;Night-Jerry;I'm a friend of your Son-in-Law. Come with me.
6;4;Night Family;Morty;What?
6;4;Night Family;Beth;How?
6;4;Night Family;Night-Jerry;Hurry. We dooon't have long before the Proxy-drones go back online.
6;4;Night Family;Beth;Oh, thank-you, Night-Jerry.
6;4;Night Family;Night-Jerry;Anything to help Day-Jerry's family, he's a very special person...
6;4;Night Family;Jerry;Oh! Hey! Ow! Why?
6;4;Night Family;Beth;Nice. You got our Jerry back.
6;4;Night Family;Rick;Uh, yeah. Totally why I did that.
6;4;Night Family;Morty;Everybody in Rick's car!
6;4;Night Family;Rick;No, Morty! Wait!
6;4;Night Family;Gene;Having a bit a trouble with your car, Sanchez?
6;4;Night Family;Rick;Not now, Gene!
6;4;Night Family;Proxy-drone;Halt! Day-manoids are restricted from the outside world! Halt! Halt!
6;4;Night Family;Beth;Hold on to your tits.
6;4;Night Family;Beth;Where am I going?
6;4;Night Family;Rick;To the airport. We have to get as far away as possible from the somnambulator before we fall asleep.
6;4;Night Family;Morty;What about Summer? We can't leave her behind.
6;4;Night Family;Rick;She's not your sister anymore, Morty. Consider her dead. Eat shit, Summer! Sweetie, ya gotta shake those robots.
6;4;Night Family;Morty;I think we lost them.
6;4;Night Family;Beth;Son of a bitch!
6;4;Night Family;Rick;Damn it, we lost Morty!
6;4;Night Family;Jerry;Ahh! Beth! Watch out!
6;4;Night Family;Night-Summer;You cannot escap... Ahh, shit!
6;4;Night Family;Police Cop;Stop, or I'll shoot everyone!
6;4;Night Family;Night-Summer;Take the wheel.
6;4;Night Family;Night-Rick;As you wish.
6;4;Night Family;Beth;Let go of me, ya little shit!
6;4;Night Family;Jerry;No! You're going the wrong way!
6;4;Night Family;Night-Morty;Silence, Day-breather.
6;4;Night Family;Jerry;Ahh! Morty, you're choking me.
6;4;Night Family;Night-Morty;I know.
6;4;Night Family;Morty;Ow! What the heck, Dad? 
6;4;Night Family;Jerry;Help me stop your Mom.
6;4;Night Family;Night-Summer;Look out, you useless old man!
6;4;Night Family;Rick;What the hell? Gimmie that gun and take the wheel, stupid.
6;4;Night Family;Summer;Jesus! Sorry!
6;4;Night Family;Morty;The Night-Family's trying to make us go back home! Ya gotta turn around.
6;4;Night Family;Gene;Why even bother, Gene?
6;4;Night Family;Morty;Good job, Mom. Back on course.
6;4;Night Family;Jerry;Phew. Almost didn't make it.
6;4;Night Family;Proxy-drone;Hit the sheets, Day-manoids.
6;4;Night Family;Morty;Night-Person!
6;4;Night Family;Night-Jerry;Hey! I'm on your side! I'm on your side!
6;4;Night Family;Morty;That's right, sorry.
6;4;Night Family;Beth;Sorry! Rough day.
6;4;Night Family;Proxy-drone;Daymanoids.
6;4;Night Family;Night-Jerry;Come on. Jump.
6;4;Night Family;Summer;Why? I'm already in a perfectly functional car.
6;4;Night Family;Night-Jerry;Uhh... Family?
6;4;Night Family;Summer;Aww!
6;4;Night Family;Rick;Everybody awake?
6;4;Night Family;Morty;We are now.
6;4;Night Family;Jerry;What the hay?
6;4;Night Family;Rick;Looks like we're gonna make it, kids.
6;4;Night Family;Night-Summer;Nighty-night, slaves.
6;4;Night Family;Rick;Fuck!
6;4;Night Family;Night-Summer;Hold him down.
6;4;Night Family;Rick;No. No.
6;4;Night Family;Night-Jerry;Stop! Rick, we're all the same people. There must be some agreement we can reach to stop this god awful conflict?
6;4;Night Family;Rick;Oh? Like what?
6;4;Night Family;Night-Summer;I would consider a truce, if the Day-manoids would rinse their dishes.
6;4;Night Family;Night-Beth;Fine by me.
6;4;Night Family;Night-Morty;Yes, rinse!
6;4;Night Family;Night-Jerry;That seems fair, we can end all of this right now if you agree to rinse your dishes. What do you say, Rick?
6;4;Night Family;Night-Summer;Let's go home. Right, Grandpa?
6;4;Night Family;Night-Rick;Great idea, Summer.
6;4;Night Family;Bank Employee;So until you pay that fee, plus the multiple overdue charges, your account will remain frozen.
6;4;Night Family;Night-Beth;Normally this would have been dealt with by our Day-manoid oppressors but we recently freed ourselves from the shackles of the night.
6;4;Night Family;Bank Employee;Honey, I got thirty more calls to make today.
6;4;Night Family;Night-Jerry;The bank repossessed the car.
6;4;Night Family;Night-Summer;Aw, Man. I got logged out of my Twitter account and don't know my password. Shit.
6;4;Night Family;Night-Beth;We spent all the Day-people's money on vacations, renting concert halls and Night-centric streaming subscriptions. We're broke.
6;4;Night Family;Night-Summer;I guess, there's a lot more work to seizing the day than I thought.
6;4;Night Family;Night-Rick;I have a device that will solve all of our problems.
6;4;Night Family;Summer;Whoa. How long have we been asleep?
6;4;Night Family;Rick;Ah, can't be that long. Oh, my god! No! They killed the choco taco!
6;5;Final DeSmithation;Jerry;Ah! Now, that was some fantastic chow mein. And before you say that sounded racist, you can ask the waiter how they say it.
6;5;Final DeSmithation;Beth;It's Panda Express, honey. The waiter's from Portland.
6;5;Final DeSmithation;Rick;"Alright, who the hell changed my ringtone to the theme from Taxi""?"""
6;5;Final DeSmithation;Morty;"It's a new thing on Taxi Tok. That's a subculture on TikTok of kids who decided the theme from Taxi"" slaps."""
6;5;Final DeSmithation;Summer;"Now you have to play the Taxi"" theme for ten people while I film it."""
6;5;Final DeSmithation;Rick;I don't have to do shit. That's dumb.
6;5;Final DeSmithation;Summer;It raises awareness for leukemia.
6;5;Final DeSmithation;Jerry;So... Who else is excited for the zoo tomorrow? Zoos are my favorite kind of non-water park. It's just a shame that they both give you diarrhea.
6;5;Final DeSmithation;Beth;You only get diarrhea at the zoo if you eat the food you're supposed to feed to the animals. 
6;5;Final DeSmithation;Summer;Which you've done, twice.
6;5;Final DeSmithation;Jerry;They put it in gumball machines.
6;5;Final DeSmithation;Summer;"You know, fortune cookies only come true if you eat the cookie first. Alright. Hard work often pays off""? Lame."""
6;5;Final DeSmithation;Beth;"Family time is time well spent."" Okay, that's not only empty. It's been disproven."""
6;5;Final DeSmithation;Morty;"Okay, mine says, Family time is time well..."" Oh, man, I got the same one?"""
6;5;Final DeSmithation;Beth;Boo.
6;5;Final DeSmithation;Summer;Boo.
6;5;Final DeSmithation;Morty;What's your stupid twenty first century watered-down fortune cookie say, Dad?
6;5;Final DeSmithation;Jerry;"You will have sex with your mother""."""
6;5;Final DeSmithation;Jerry;Fortune cookies aren't legitimate, right?
6;5;Final DeSmithation;Beth;Jerry, are you seriously asking if I think you're gonna have sex with your mom?
6;5;Final DeSmithation;Jerry;No, I-I wanted to ask if it's okay with you if I make myself throw up the cookie.
6;5;Final DeSmithation;Beth;If it makes you feel better and you can do it quietly, yes, but don't hand that advice down to Summer.
6;5;Final DeSmithation;Jerry;Ugh! Can't do it. Sleepy Gary ruined my gag reflex, which is frustrating because Sleepy Gary wasn't real.
6;5;Final DeSmithation;Beth;Neither are fortune cookies. Go to sleep, Jerry.
6;5;Final DeSmithation;Jerry;I know they're not real. It's just... Why is it so specific? And why are three of the numbers a few numbers off from my Mom's birthday?! Can we investigate this, Rick?
6;5;Final DeSmithation;Rick;It's not an X-File, Jerry, You got the world's last interesting fortune.
6;5;Final DeSmithation;Summer;Dad, can you explain to TikTok what's going on with your mom?
6;5;Final DeSmithation;Jerry;Summer, no social videoing! What if Mi-Maw sees it? We can't let her know this is a thing that might happen!
6;5;Final DeSmithation;Morty;"Whoa, whoa, whoa! Uh, might""?"""
6;5;Final DeSmithation;Jerry;She's calling again. She doesn't usually call this much.
6;5;Final DeSmithation;Beth;Because you don't usually ghost her because you don't usually decide you're at risk of...
6;5;Final DeSmithation;Jerry;What if she's calling me to tell me I'm adopted?!
6;5;Final DeSmithation;Morty;Well, yeah, then you should definitely hit that.
6;5;Final DeSmithation;Jerry;That's not funny!
6;5;Final DeSmithation;Beth;Jerry, you're making it funny by taking it seriously. And none of us will be laughing if you let this ruin our zoo trip.
6;5;Final DeSmithation;Jerry;Rick, can you use science to make it impossible for me to...
6;5;Final DeSmithation;Rick;Jerry, you're insulting science. And as the most powerful man in the universe, if I create technology to prevent a random occurrence, I'll end up making it more possible than random.
6;5;Final DeSmithation;Jerry;When do we leave for the zoo?
6;5;Final DeSmithation;Beth;One hour. You have one hour to let go of this.
6;5;Final DeSmithation;Jerry;I'm already done thinking about it.
6;5;Final DeSmithation;Morty;Check that out, huh?
6;5;Final DeSmithation;Jerry;Ah! Ah! No! Aah! Aah! Aah! Let me out! Let me out!
6;5;Final DeSmithation;Beth;You have ten seconds.
6;5;Final DeSmithation;Jerry;I want to go. You know of my love for the zoo!
6;5;Final DeSmithation;Summer;Why are you dressed like Morty?
6;5;Final DeSmithation;Jerry;Because Morty's mom is Beth.
6;5;Final DeSmithation;Morty;I'm not unpacking that.
6;5;Final DeSmithation;Space Beth;Okay, if you think I have this much patience for the zoo, on Earth, you're sorely mistaken.
6;5;Final DeSmithation;Beth;Jerry, if you don't come with us, I will be so disappointed.
6;5;Final DeSmithation;Rick;Okay, you guys should probably go on without Jerry. I just took some readings on his probability field, and this fortune has some strange powers I'm gonna need to investigate.
6;5;Final DeSmithation;Jerry;Really?! Oh, God, I knew it.
6;5;Final DeSmithation;Beth;Okay. Well. Be careful, honey.
6;5;Final DeSmithation;Jerry;Ooh! Bring me back a handful of zebra snacks? A-And please take pictures with my favorite animal, the white tiger!
6;5;Final DeSmithation;Summer;Because they breed via incest?
6;5;Final DeSmithation;Jerry;Is that true?!
6;5;Final DeSmithation;Jerry;Ah. I knew I was right. 
6;5;Final DeSmithation;Rick;Not even close. I just didn't want to see someone get bullied into going to a zoo. You may be the single dumbest human I've ever met, Jerry, but you still have a right to take whatever you want seriously.
6;5;Final DeSmithation;Jerry;Thank you, but if that thing says I'm not gonna do it with my mom, I can go to the zoo.
6;5;Final DeSmithation;Rick;Jerry, this thing measures aberrations in probability waves. I didn't even bother to turn it on because if I did... Huh.
6;5;Final DeSmithation;Jerry;What?!
6;5;Final DeSmithation;Rick;Nothing. Don't get weird on me. But, uh, since we're free for the afternoon, you mind doing a quick activity? 
6;5;Final DeSmithation;Rick;We're gonna disprove this with efficient brute force. These are two shoeboxes. Both are empty, but I wrote your mother's name on the inside of one.
6;5;Final DeSmithation;Jerry;What? God, no! If you think for a second I'm gonna put my...
6;5;Final DeSmithation;Rick;Good. I didn't wanna do this anyway.
6;5;Final DeSmithation;Jerry;Fine! Can I just tell you which box I would put my penis in?
6;5;Final DeSmithation;Rick;Saying it seems worse, but okay.
6;5;Final DeSmithation;Jerry;Alright. I would put my penis in the box on the right.
6;5;Final DeSmithation;Rick;Great. Uh, look in the other direction, and I'm gonna switch up the boxes.
6;5;Final DeSmithation;Jerry;This feels really low-tech.
6;5;Final DeSmithation;Rick;Yeah, 'cause we're measuring reality.
6;5;Final DeSmithation;Jerry;I would take out my penis and place it in the box on the... right.
6;5;Final DeSmithation;Rick;Again.
6;5;Final DeSmithation;Jerry;I would put my penis...
6;5;Final DeSmithation;Rick;"Jerry, you don't have to say penis"" every time. Just left or right."""
6;5;Final DeSmithation;Jerry;Hey, this was your idea! 
6;5;Final DeSmithation;Rick;I didn't think it'd go on this long.
6;5;Final DeSmithation;Jerry;Okay, penis. Ugh! Left!
6;5;Final DeSmithation;Rick;Keep going.
6;5;Final DeSmithation;Jerry;Right. Left. Right.
6;5;Final DeSmithation;Rick;Jerry, are you fucking peeking?
6;5;Final DeSmithation;Jerry;Tell me what's going on! You're scaring me!
6;5;Final DeSmithation;Rick;Okay, I'm just as likely to shit a balloon as I am to become a dolphin.
6;5;Final DeSmithation;Jerry;Those are things that could happen?
6;5;Final DeSmithation;Rick;Jerry, everything is as likely as anything else. Which is why it's weird that you're at all likely to...
6;5;Final DeSmithation;Jerry;To what? To what?!
6;5;Final DeSmithation;Rick;Jerry, has your mother been leaving messages?
6;5;Final DeSmithation;Jerry;Three texts. I'm afraid to read them.
6;5;Final DeSmithation;Rick;Read them.
6;5;Final DeSmithation;Jerry;She's asking if she can come visit. Why would she want that?!
6;5;Final DeSmithation;Rick;Jerry, I'm gonna tell you something I've never told anyone. We need to go to Panda Express.
6;5;Final DeSmithation;Rick;If these guys wanted my respect, they could've just gotten a liquor license.
6;5;Final DeSmithation;Jerry;Now you think this has something to do with you?
6;5;Final DeSmithation;Rick;Jerry, whoever's behind that fortune has, like, god powers. Of course it has something to do with me. What do you think I am in this story, the father-in-law?
6;5;Final DeSmithation;Rick;You guys wanted my attention? Okay, well, now I'm getting mixed signals.
6;5;Final DeSmithation;Jerry;Gah!
6;5;Final DeSmithation;Rick;Stay here, Jerry. Time to kick ass. Gonna need a soundtrack. Ship, favorites playlist, track one! Alright, fine. No wrong answers.
6;5;Final DeSmithation;Rick;Tell me where you get your cookies at, and we can all walk out of here alive!
6;5;Final DeSmithation;Panda Express Employee;Fuck you, DEA piece of shit!
6;5;Final DeSmithation;Rick;DEA?
6;5;Final DeSmithation;Panda Express Employee;Cookies?
6;5;Final DeSmithation;Rick;Fortune cookies.
6;5;Final DeSmithation;Panda Express Employee;You're not here about our gang's city-wide meth ring?
6;5;Final DeSmithation;Rick;What? No. Break the laws. They shouldn't exist anyway.
6;5;Final DeSmithation;Panda Express Employee;Wow. I am embarrassed.
6;5;Final DeSmithation;Rick;Aw, me too. Sorry about, uh, these dead guys.
6;5;Final DeSmithation;Panda Express Employee;Comes with the territory.
6;5;Final DeSmithation;Rick;So w-where do you get your cookies?
6;5;Final DeSmithation;Panda Express Employee;Same distributor as everyone else. That's their truck out back.
6;5;Final DeSmithation;Rick;Solid. Okay, I'm gonna take the truck in exchange for not turning you in.
6;5;Final DeSmithation;Jerry;Geez. How much money can there be in cookies that you get for free?
6;5;Final DeSmithation;Rick;And now we're being retina scanned? Oh, oh, oh! I know! I've got a theory, Jerry.
6;5;Final DeSmithation;Jerry;Oh, good.
6;5;Final DeSmithation;Rick;This place is run by Cookie Monster. He's really protective about his cookies. C'mon, man. You can't crack a smile? Oh, yeah... you're worried about doing it with your mom. Okay. Fair enough.
6;5;Final DeSmithation;Jerry;Whoa!
6;5;Final DeSmithation;Rick;Fucking cameras everywhere. That cup is a camera. That tree is a camera.
6;5;Final DeSmithation;Jerry;Can you disable them?
6;5;Final DeSmithation;Rick;Stealth rule number one... Turning off 300 cameras draws more attention than changing outfits. Looks like we need to dress for success.
6;5;Final DeSmithation;Rick;Eye of Thundara, give me suits beyond suits! Jerry, assistant clothing. MAKE-UP!
6;5;Final DeSmithation;Jerry;What the hell was that?
6;5;Final DeSmithation;Rick;"Reuseable Sailor Moon"" sequence. If we ever need to show you becoming my assistant again, we can repeat it and save lots of money."""
6;5;Final DeSmithation;Jerry;Why does an operation bigger than the government want me to... couple with my mother?
6;5;Final DeSmithation;Rick;Whoa. Bezos? Bill Gates? Prime ministers? Weirdly, Billy Zane is also here.
6;5;Final DeSmithation;Jennith Padrow-Chunt;Hello. You're about to meet me, Jennith Padrow-Chunt. Fifteen years ago, I was living in my parents' garage, eating ramen out of a toilet when I discovered something. Fate isn't fiction. Everything you want can be yours, if you ask for it. Just ask me.
6;5;Final DeSmithation;Jennith Padrow-Chunt;Hello, me.
6;5;Final DeSmithation;Jennith Padrow-Chunt;Hello, me.
6;5;Final DeSmithation;Jennith Padrow-Chunt;Look at me's. Every suit I wear is virgin white. I sleep on a bed of loose grains and begin every morning by dragging my perfect vagina across Chinese silver grass. I'm firm and ripe.
6;5;Final DeSmithation;Jerry;My mother's plane just landed. She took a photo at the airport in front of that Wolfgang Puck that smells like a kindergarten.
6;5;Final DeSmithation;Jennith Padrow-Chunt;Want to know the secret to how I changed my future?
6;5;Final DeSmithation;Jerry;Yes.
6;5;Final DeSmithation;Jennith Padrow-Chunt;Well, once you're a level seven investor, you'll learn that and more.
6;5;Final DeSmithation;Rick;Yeah, we're not getting the answers we want here. Let's go deeper.
6;5;Final DeSmithation;Fortune 500 Executive;And now, thanks to your generous contributions, here are this year's cookies.
6;5;Final DeSmithation;Fortune 500 Employee;"You will receive a six-point-eight percent year-on-year increase"". Very nice."""
6;5;Final DeSmithation;Fortune 500 Employee;"Your talents are appreciated... when you become junior partner."""""
6;5;Final DeSmithation;Fortune 500 Employee;"Holy shit! I'm going to be on Dancing with the Stars""!"""
6;5;Final DeSmithation;Fortune 500 Employee;Please, I can get the money. I swear! Gak!
6;5;Final DeSmithation;Fortune 500 Scientist;I'm afraid it's too late for that.
6;5;Final DeSmithation;Fortune 500 Employee;"Oh, God, what does it say? Your penis will be mangled by a frozen-yogurt machine at the U.N.""? I know that machine! This would sound impossible to a layman, but to me it rings inevitable!"""
6;5;Final DeSmithation;Rick;Holy shit. This is real. They're controlling fate for profit.
6;5;Final DeSmithation;Jerry;I'm glad you're happy. Now can we blow up the building or something?
6;5;Final DeSmithation;Rick;I don't think that's the best way to take away their power, Jerry. Let's take it in a way that ends with us having it.
6;5;Final DeSmithation;Jerry;You mean you having it.
6;5;Final DeSmithation;Rick;I'll share it.
6;5;Final DeSmithation;Jerry;Then you fuck my mom.
6;5;Final DeSmithation;Rick;That's not how it works, and I already have.
6;5;Final DeSmithation;Jerry;What?!
6;5;Final DeSmithation;Rick;Jesus, Jerry, come on.
6;5;Final DeSmithation;Rick;How unfortunate.
6;5;Final DeSmithation;Security Guard;Use the emergency fortunes!
6;5;Final DeSmithation;Rick;Fighting fortunes. T-T-They're leveling up!
6;5;Final DeSmithation;Security Guard;"You'll have great success in a fight."""""
6;5;Final DeSmithation;Rick;I'll be damned. Fuck! This both sucks and is really valuable data.
6;5;Final DeSmithation;Jerry;Oh! Aah! Wha! Rick, what are you doing?!
6;5;Final DeSmithation;Rick;Using you as a human shield.
6;5;Final DeSmithation;Jerry;You said it! You said the thing I thought you were doing!
6;5;Final DeSmithation;Security Guard;We've got intruders. And one of them... has an unresolved fortune.
6;5;Final DeSmithation;Jennith Padrow-Chunt;We need that man's mother.
6;5;Final DeSmithation;Scurity Guard;Lot of mothers in the world, ma'am.
6;5;Final DeSmithation;Jennith Padrow-Chunt;But only one of them is Mrs... Ugh, God damn it... Smith?
6;5;Final DeSmithation;Jerry;So are we going to ignore that you tried to stop bullets using my body?
6;5;Final DeSmithation;Rick;You have an unresolved fortune. Until you have sex with your mom, you're basically immortal. Do you have any idea how amazing that is?
6;5;Final DeSmithation;Jerry;You don't even care about me. You just want fortune cookie power.
6;5;Final DeSmithation;Rick;Okay, Jerry, how 'bout this? If it comes down to it, I promise I'll put a bullet in her head.
6;5;Final DeSmithation;Jerry;No!
6;5;Final DeSmithation;Rick;Ah, you're right. The fortune didn't say she'd be alive, did it?
6;5;Final DeSmithation;Jerry;I hate you!
6;5;Final DeSmithation;Rick;Hate productive things. Hate crawling through a fucking air vent.
6;5;Final DeSmithation;Jerry;Ah, those are those weird hex-headed screws. Do your screwdriver fingers...
6;5;Final DeSmithation;Jerry;Well, at least we have no idea what's going on.
6;5;Final DeSmithation;Rick;That's a Lockerean. I-It's a species that eats chaos. But it has a digestive disorder. Its stomach is stripping randomness from spacetime and leaving behind super-dense pockets of energy that bend entropy towards definable outcomes. I mean, th-that's how fate works. It's a field, like gravity, but instead of pulling small toward big, it pulls unknown toward known.
6;5;Final DeSmithation;Jerry;Ah, so we do know what's going on.
6;5;Final DeSmithation;Rick;We know this... everyone that's had a fortune cookie has eaten this thing's poop. Fortune cookies are alien poop.
6;5;Final DeSmithation;Rick;These fortunes are so basic. Why wouldn't you use this power to change the world? Or at least get Nintendo to make a portable VR headset?
6;5;Final DeSmithation;Old M. Hucksbee;"Ooh, this place ain't for creatin' the future, but controllin' it. Hi, I'm Old. Old M. Hucksbee. The M"" stands for ""Man."""""
6;5;Final DeSmithation;Rick;You're an arch little character. You're the reason fortune cookies suck?
6;5;Final DeSmithation;Old M. Hucksbee;No, no, no, that's Jenneth Chunt's idea. You have to glut the marketplace with pointless fortunes to increase the value of real ones. Controlling destiny for a price, that's the Fortune 500's fortune.
6;5;Final DeSmithation;Rick;And you're trying to stop them?
6;5;Final DeSmithation;Old M. Hucksbee;Just tryin' to get out. I want to be free with this here alien gal so we can get married. Then we can have relations. Can't do that before marriage, you know. I'm a Catholic.
6;5;Final DeSmithation;Rick;Uh, does the alien want that? It's not exactly what I'd call a sentient species.
6;5;Final DeSmithation;Old M. Hucksbee;A man knows.
6;5;Final DeSmithation;Jerry;What does this have to do with me? You put this in my cookie.
6;5;Final DeSmithation;Old M. Hucksbee;"Yep. Oh, I've been tryin' to get people's attention. I'd make fortunes saying, You're a-gonna break your leg unless you investigate this cookie company"", or, ""Please come help me or a virus will shut down the world"". Finally I just made a bunch that said, ""You're gonna have sex with your own momma."""""
6;5;Final DeSmithation;Jerry;How many? It... What happened to the others?
6;5;Final DeSmithation;Old M. Hucksbee;I 'spose they fucked their moms. Now let's cut her chains and get the hell outta here.
6;5;Final DeSmithation;Old M. Hucksbee;Well, shit on a spaghetti.
6;5;Final DeSmithation;Jennith Padrow-Chunt;Hello, Jerry Smith. Glad you could join us on Bring Your Mother to Work day.
6;5;Final DeSmithation;Jerry;Mom!
6;5;Final DeSmithation;Joyce;Hi, Jerry. Your friends picked me up in a limousine. They said you won something, and I should be the one to give it to you?
6;5;Final DeSmithation;Rick;You sick fucks.
6;5;Final DeSmithation;Jerry;Are you guys enjoying this?
6;5;Final DeSmithation;Jennith Padrow-Chunt;I used to think I was just a regular white woman. Then I discovered I could control my destiny.
6;5;Final DeSmithation;Rick;All white women think that. The truth is, this alien crashed in your yard and you ate its shit.
6;5;Final DeSmithation;Jennith Padrow-Chunt;How dare you! What's your name?
6;5;Final DeSmithation;Rick;How dare you?! We should've blown up the building.
6;5;Final DeSmithation;Jennith Padrow-Chunt;"Doesn't matter. All I was gonna say is, Guess what, insert name. Time for you to eat shit"". But first..."""
6;5;Final DeSmithation;Joyce;Aah! Oh, no! I'm so wet!
6;5;Final DeSmithation;Jerry;Ah! No!
6;5;Final DeSmithation;Rick;Jerry! Come back and block bullets.

6;5;Final DeSmithation;Rick;Fuck!
6;5;Final DeSmithation;Soldier;"You can't hide! My fortune said, Headshots only"". Harry! Greg! Lashawn! Dave C.! Dave M.! Noooo! You piece of shit, you killed my friends."""
6;5;Final DeSmithation;Rick;Oh! Alright, what does the future hold? Maybe I can Pokémon this shit. Blast him, or we're both gonna die.
6;5;Final DeSmithation;Soldier;Oh, God! Oh, God!
6;5;Final DeSmithation;Rick;Whoa! You control-control water. Like, the water inside a guy. That's a gross power.
6;5;Final DeSmithation;Rick;I'm gonna let you live because your fortune sucks.
6;5;Final DeSmithation;Soldier;You can't kill me! I can't be killed!
6;5;Final DeSmithation;Rick;Trust me, that's not as good as it sounds.
6;5;Final DeSmithation;Soldier;Aaaaaaah! Ah! Ah! Aah! Oh, it hurts! It burns! Fuck! Oh, my God! My ribs! I can feel my shattered ribs!
6;5;Final DeSmithation;Rick;Shit, these are useless. Where are the fighting fortunes?
6;5;Final DeSmithation;Old M. Hucksbee;Ah, no-no-no-no-no! Those are blanks! Without fortunes, the effects are completely unpredictable!
6;5;Final DeSmithation;Rick;Alright.
6;5;Final DeSmithation;Dinosaur Robot;I am the son of God!
6;5;Final DeSmithation;Jerry;Ah!
6;5;Final DeSmithation;Joyce;Jerry! Help me, Jerry!
6;5;Final DeSmithation;Jerry;Mom! Stay away! Just stay away!
6;5;Final DeSmithation;Jennith Padrow-Chunt;Come on and fuck already!
6;5;Final DeSmithation;Soldier;Ma'am, is it possible we're being given a chance to take a step back and examine our behavior?
6;5;Final DeSmithation;Jennith Padrow-Chunt;You can't kill me, old man. I also have an unresolved fortune.
6;5;Final DeSmithation;Rick;"The most successful businesswoman on Earth?"" You could do anything you wanted and you chose... work?"""
6;5;Final DeSmithation;Jennith Padrow-Chunt;Every day I get closer to an unattainable goal. A one-woman lifestyle brand, forever!
6;5;Final DeSmithation;Rick;Well, I just used a dark web account to hack Goldman Sachs, remove trillions of dollars, and purchase everything your company offers. Congratulations! You're officially the most successful businesswoman on Earth. Fortune fulfilled. And now I'm emptying your bank accounts and giving the money back to Goldman Sachs, because I sit dead-center on the alignment chart.
6;5;Final DeSmithation;Jennith Padrow-Chunt;You son of a bitch!
6;5;Final DeSmithation;Rick;How does it feel to achieve your dreams? Empty, right? Like when DiCaprio won the Oscar. You could see it in his face.
6;5;Final DeSmithation;Jennith Padrow-Chunt;I still have one more dream... Watching you die, Rick Sanchez!
6;5;Final DeSmithation;Rick;Ha! You knew my name!
6;5;Final DeSmithation;Old M. Hucksbee;She's free! Run! Run, my beauty!
6;5;Final DeSmithation;Old M. Hucksbee;Well, butterfly on a corncob. I see that I've romanticized a wild animal the same way Margaret Howe did when she jerked off that dolphin in the nineteen-and sixty's. Both she and I assaulted a captive creature, and expected it to be reciprocal. Welp, joopityboot. Time to die.
6;5;Final DeSmithation;Jennith Padrow-Chunt;Ah! Follow me, my queen!
6;5;Final DeSmithation;Rick;That's all the bad guys down. We almost got this, Jer. Ah! No! Oh, sticks-to-walls guy, I-I-I guess we were both wrong! Oh, God!
6;5;Final DeSmithation;Jerry;Aaaah! Rick! Please!
6;5;Final DeSmithation;Rick;Jerry, I've got the creature.
6;5;Final DeSmithation;Jerry;I knew it. I knew it.
6;5;Final DeSmithation;Rick;God damn it!
6;5;Final DeSmithation;Jerry;Aaaaaaaah! Oh, God! Aaaaah!
6;5;Final DeSmithation;Rick;God damn it.
6;5;Final DeSmithation;Jerry;Ah. Holy shit, that was close.
6;5;Final DeSmithation;Joyce;Close to what?
6;5;Final DeSmithation;Rick;Close to everyone but your son getting anything they want forever.
6;5;Final DeSmithation;Jerry;You saved me. I will never stop holding this over you, as if that buys me anything.
6;5;Final DeSmithation;Joyce;We should get you some clothes, son.
6;5;Final DeSmithation;Rick;Oh, oh! I can just feel the savings.
6;5;Final DeSmithation;Jerry;Hey, wait, uh... Got this at the crazy place we just were. It may look like someone stuck a hand-written fortune in there last second, but I'm pretty sure that's just the way it came. Besides, these don't mean anything.
6;5;Final DeSmithation;Rick;Jerry, while I appreciate the sentiment, this is a huge waste of the last real fortune.
6;5;Final DeSmithation;Jerry;Oh. I'm sorry. I just... 
6;5;Final DeSmithation;Rick;It's cool, it's cool.
6;5;Final DeSmithation;Jerry;Thanks, friend.
6;5;Final DeSmithation;Rick;Friend?! Did you just say friend?
6;5;Final DeSmithation;Jerry;What? W-W-What did I do?
6;5;Final DeSmithation;Rick;You fucking idiot! I'm not your friend! Why did you think I was your friend? Look at this you piece of shit.
6;5;Final DeSmithation;Jerry;Yeah, yeah, yeah, so?
6;5;Final DeSmithation;Rick;I was immortal! I was immortal for that whole fight. All I had to do was never make a new friend. Jesus fucking Christ, Jerry.
6;5;Final DeSmithation;Jerry;I'm sorry! We're not friends!
6;5;Final DeSmithation;Rick;"Yeah, too late, bonehead. It doesn't say new permanent friend"". All friendships end, especially new ones."""
6;5;Final DeSmithation;Jerry;Well, maybe that's a fate the two of us still control.
6;5;Final DeSmithation;Rick;I'm... I'm sorry I did that.
6;5;Final DeSmithation;Jerry;It's fine.
6;5;Final DeSmithation;Voice;The zoo. Animals. Balloons. Moats. Cages. A fun time for the whole family. But you don't care about that. You're a zebra. You're here for the unparalleled dining experience of hand-fed zebra food. Delicious. He... Hey, wait. Don't eat... Th... That's for the zebras. It's making you sick! What are you doing? Jesus, why have they left all the zebra-feeding to the people who come to the zoo? Is that the only way the zebras can get food? They're so hungry. What the fuck is happening? We're out of zebra food. Okay? There's no food left. Don't come to the zoo. This was supposed to be a commercial for zebras, targeted to zebras. The premise itself was questionable, but this... This is a nightmare! Don't go to the zoo. Stay away from the zoo. Oh, God, what are you doing in the booth? Get out! Get out, you're mad with...
6;5;Final DeSmithation;Voice;Ow. Eat it. Eat zebra food.
6;5;Final DeSmithation;Morty;Okay, um. I guess I can't blame Dad for being confused about what to do with the zebra food. Also, I have no idea why they're running this ad, like, on a loop? There were murders in it, and it was specifically telling you to do the thing it didn't want you to do until the very end, when it reversed. Why would they sell the zebra food in the gift shop, unless... I mean, do the zebras shop in here? Are we the ones in the zoo? Oh, is that the twist? Okay, we're... it's a human zoo. Got it.
6;6;Juricksic Mort;Newscaster;"And in weird things in space news, that mysterious rift"" is still there. Not gone yet. You remember that, don't you? It's probably important. Back to you, Tabitha."""
6;6;Juricksic Mort;Morty;Rick, Mom's working, and Dad's still sleeping. I'm... I'm... I'm gonna be late.
6;6;Juricksic Mort;Rick;Yeah, yeah. I-I got you. Here.
6;6;Juricksic Mort;Morty;Holy shit. I-Is the portal gun working again?
6;6;Juricksic Mort;Rick;Yeah, pretty much. Sometimes that happens.
6;6;Juricksic Mort;Morty;Just get the keys.
6;6;Juricksic Mort;Morty;It's actually been nice taking a break from the portal travel stuff. I-I've been racking up a lot of high-school adventures.
6;6;Juricksic Mort;Rick;I have a process, Morty.
6;6;Juricksic Mort;Morty;Huh?
6;6;Juricksic Mort;Rick;I'm fixing my portal gun, and every time you bring it up, it blocks my creative flow. A-And then I'm forced to take longer on purpose just to train you to not bring it up.
6;6;Juricksic Mort;Morty;"Geez. Do you know what projection"" is?"""
6;6;Juricksic Mort;Rick;Do you?
6;6;Juricksic Mort;Morty;No. I-I-I heard Mom use it.

6;6;Juricksic Mort;Morty;You guys don't have to react like this every day.
6;6;Juricksic Mort;Mr. Goldenfold;Last time, the aliens made me lick all the toilet seats. That's right... made me. I see that look on your faces. What did you do, ya tiny monster?
6;6;Juricksic Mort;Morty;This isn't me.
6;6;Juricksic Mort;Newscaster;"The people demand to know... Do these visitors come in peace? But first, Peter's Pizza Corner."" What slice we reviewing today, Petey?"""
6;6;Juricksic Mort;Peter;Cheese.
6;6;Juricksic Mort;Egyptian General;If these aliens want Earth, they'll have to go through Egypt. And they can ask mummies how that goes.
6;6;Juricksic Mort;Egyptian General;Mummy mia! Dinosaurs are back?
6;6;Juricksic Mort;Brachiosaurus;Monkeys went bald?
6;6;Juricksic Mort;Triceratops;Before we start... where are the rest of... us?
6;6;Juricksic Mort;President;Uh... They died. Uh... Long time ago. Way before us. We didn't see nothin'.
6;6;Juricksic Mort;Triceratops;But surely our ancestors must have left some evidence behind. Why is he nervous?
6;6;Juricksic Mort;President;Because, uh, you're dinosaurs. It's weird. Thought you were dead.
6;6;Juricksic Mort;Triceratops;"Moving on, we dinosaurs"" evolved here on Earth until our technology was planetarily harmonic."""
6;6;Juricksic Mort;Tyrannosaurus;That being the goal with technology.
6;6;Juricksic Mort;Triceratops;After we achieved perfect balance with Mother Earth, our best and bravest left to help other planets. Over millions of years, we've called many worlds home and helped each one flourish. Imagine our surprise upon returning home to find our species extinct and Earth now in the care of... you guys.
6;6;Juricksic Mort;Brachiosaurus;When we left, you were basically squirrels.
6;6;Juricksic Mort;President;Well, uh, we've come a long way, and we... We've buried a lot more than nuts.
6;6;Juricksic Mort;Tyrannosaurus;We've evolved past nonconstructive criticism, so let's agree you've done your best.
6;6;Juricksic Mort;Triceratops;"You're still alive. But surely there was some point between gunpowder and something called Amazon Prime"" that you folks had to think, ""Are we supposed to be running a planet? Wouldn't we rather make... Marvel movies?"" How many Marvel movies have you made?"""
6;6;Juricksic Mort;USA General;29, and 14 more on the way.
6;6;Juricksic Mort;Triceratops;See, you love doing that. And we love helping new life-forms get their footing. So now that we're back, we can respectfully take it from here.
6;6;Juricksic Mort;President;"Now, hold on. If you've seen Endgame"", you know invasion is not something Earth takes lying down."""
6;6;Juricksic Mort;Brachiosaurus;This is not an invasion. Besides, wouldn't you like to lie down?
6;6;Juricksic Mort;Triceratops;"Ugh. You must be exhausted. Put your feet up, get more tattoos, finish rounding out this Ant-Man"" character."""
6;6;Juricksic Mort;Tyrannosaurus;"Think of it like your Earth concept of vacation,"" except permanent."""
6;6;Juricksic Mort;President;I think I speak for all world leaders when I say that the poor people would just murder us if we made you leave, so... welcome home, dinosaurs.
6;6;Juricksic Mort;President;Should we nuke them?
6;6;Juricksic Mort;USA General;I'm on vacation, Curtis.
6;6;Juricksic Mort;President;Well, you leaned into this fast.
6;6;Juricksic Mort;Beth;Ugh. I can't even pretend to feel useful in a game. This is how humanity's story ends? Relieved of duty and sat at the kids' table?
6;6;Juricksic Mort;Rick;I gotta respect these dinosaurs. They dominated a whole species just by calling its bluff about wanting more free time.
6;6;Juricksic Mort;Beth;They didn't even dominate us because we're not worth a fight to them. We've become biological Tyler Perry movies.
6;6;Juricksic Mort;Morty;All they've done is help.
6;6;Juricksic Mort;Beth;We didn't need their help. We were not the problem. This house recycles. They sort it at the trash facility!
6;6;Juricksic Mort;Summer;"What the F""? My dance videos are getting, like, zero likes now."""
6;6;Juricksic Mort;Morty;Oh, yeah. The dinos kicked pedophiles off TikTok.
6;6;Juricksic Mort;Summer;Great. So now I'm broke?
6;6;Juricksic Mort;Beth;You don't need money anymore.
6;6;Juricksic Mort;Summer;So what's this for now? Phone calls? Ugh.
6;6;Juricksic Mort;Beth;Oh, c'mon, Dad. You don't hate this, too?
6;6;Juricksic Mort;Rick;Why would I? I-I was already doing what I wanted. I do think it's kind of funny that you're all basically Jerry now.
6;6;Juricksic Mort;Beth;Fuck.
6;6;Juricksic Mort;Beth;Jerry, how do you do it?
6;6;Juricksic Mort;Summer;Yeah, Dad, how do you do it?
6;6;Juricksic Mort;Morty;How do you do it, Dad?
6;6;Juricksic Mort;Jerry;Huh?
6;6;Juricksic Mort;Summer;How do you do it?
6;6;Juricksic Mort;Morty;How do you do it?
6;6;Juricksic Mort;Beth;How do you do it?
6;6;Juricksic Mort;Jerry;It's finally happened. All right!
6;6;Juricksic Mort;Jerry;Does anyone know how to mail things to publishers?
6;6;Juricksic Mort;Rick;Uhp. President only pages me if it's an emergency or he needs Molly.
6;6;Juricksic Mort;President;I'm sure glad you stayed open, Beau. Wish we could pay, but no more capitalism.
6;6;Juricksic Mort;Beau;I never make ribs for the money, Mr. President.
6;6;Juricksic Mort;Rick;Oh, um, here ya go.
6;6;Juricksic Mort;President;That's not why I called. Drugs can't solve this problem. I can't live like this anymore. At first, it was fun spending all day watching whatever YouTube autoplays after the last one autoplayed, but a man can only watch so many ads for Grammarly. Rick. Please. You're not bound by morality. Get rid of them. Slit their necks. Zero Dark Thirty these fuckers for the good of the species. I won't tell. Help us go back to the old days, where we pretend to fix the problems we caused.
6;6;Juricksic Mort;Rick;You think I'm gonna side with you over hyper-intelligent creatures operating way beyond your comprehension? I have more in common with them than you.
6;6;Juricksic Mort;President;You pompous autistic cadaver! You think you're above this? I ought to...
6;6;Juricksic Mort;Beau;Look here, Mr. President. When I need my ribs to be tender and delicious, I pamper them. See, if you give someone what they want, they'll give you what you need. I'm jus' saying.
6;6;Juricksic Mort;President;I see your point, Beau. All right, Rick. Ha ha. Name your price.
6;6;Juricksic Mort;Rick;Aw, crap.
6;6;Juricksic Mort;President;"God damn it. How often are you Westworld-ing"" me?"""
6;6;Juricksic Mort;Rick;Hang on. Rib-tips jammed his folk-chip again.
6;6;Juricksic Mort;Beau;Ol' reliable Rick. Always k-knows what to do. Trustworthy. Honest.
6;6;Juricksic Mort;President;What do you want, Rick?
6;6;Juricksic Mort;Rick;I won't stoop to answering that again. You know exactly what I want.
6;6;Juricksic Mort;President;I can't just snap my fingers and get you that job.
6;6;Juricksic Mort;Rick;Yeah, yeah. Thanks for lunch.
6;6;Juricksic Mort;President;Fine. Fine! If you get rid of the dinosaurs... you can host the Oscars.
6;6;Juricksic Mort;Rick;Yes!
6;6;Juricksic Mort;Beau;Righteous R-Rick. Straight shootin', t-truth-tellin', never wets the bed.
6;6;Juricksic Mort;Triceratops;Goodbye, old friends. May you rest in peace, rather than the tank of an S.U.V.
6;6;Juricksic Mort;Rick;Hello, fellow cosmic voyagers.
6;6;Juricksic Mort;Triceratops;Can we help you?
6;6;Juricksic Mort;Rick;Actually, I can probably help you. See, I'm technically human, but I've come to be more, you know, on your level.
6;6;Juricksic Mort;Tyrannosaurus;We're fine, thank you.
6;6;Juricksic Mort;Rick;Maybe I'm being too indirect. I happen to dabble in multiversal travel, and I could probably zap you guys to an alternate Earth.
6;6;Juricksic Mort;Triceratops;"We used portal travel eons ago, but evolved to a one-universe, one-truth policy as the highest form of existence. Sort of a put your own oxygen mask on before helping others"" type of a thing. Have you been on a plane?"""
6;6;Juricksic Mort;Rick;Yes, I've been on a plane.
6;6;Juricksic Mort;Brachiosaurus;We have no problem if you jump dimensions. Although we sense your gateway device is suboptimal. Let us help.
6;6;Juricksic Mort;Rick;I don't need help. I-I'm here to help you. What the hell is this?
6;6;Juricksic Mort;Tyrannosaurus;"A Portal Pistol."" The gateways are see-through, not a green swirl, so now you can see where you're going."""
6;6;Juricksic Mort;Morty;Clever girl.
6;6;Juricksic Mort;Triceratops;If you'd like, we could patch up your little interdimensional rift too.
6;6;Juricksic Mort;Rick;No, leave it. I know how to close that. That's there for a reason. Very canonical.
6;6;Juricksic Mort;Morty;Don't you just want it closed?
6;6;Juricksic Mort;Rick;Morty, whose team are you on?!
6;6;Juricksic Mort;Brachiosaurus;It's normal to be frustrated. Here.
6;6;Juricksic Mort;Rick;Oh, my God, are you fucking kidding me?
6;6;Juricksic Mort;Triceratops;Goodbye.
6;6;Juricksic Mort;Rick;No. Wait. What the fuuuuu...
6;6;Juricksic Mort;Rick;Aah! Dr. Manhattan high-road assholes teleporting me?
6;6;Juricksic Mort;Morty;Ah! I saw my bones! Why... Why wasn't that painful?
6;6;Juricksic Mort;Rick;They didn't even do it right. My... My... My fly is down.
6;6;Juricksic Mort;Morty;Your fly was already down. What are you doing with that? Rick, it was a better...
6;6;Juricksic Mort;Rick;Nothing from them is better. That thing had uptight Zen snob germs all over it.
6;6;Juricksic Mort;Morty;So, what, now you're gonna fight them?
6;6;Juricksic Mort;Rick;And prove we're violent and stupid? No. We're gonna find out what they're hiding. Only people who have really fucked up in the past have to virtue signal this hard. Look at Sean Penn.
6;6;Juricksic Mort;Morty;"But, Rick, aren't these feelings, like, what they're talking about? Like, life gets, um... programmed for competition by early stages of evolution"". Like, amoebas have to fight amoebas for energy, but once a species can get enough sugar from a machine to give itself diabetes, it's allowed to start thinking beyond conflict. I mean, it's all in their pamphlet."""
6;6;Juricksic Mort;Rick;Morty, you're a genius. I clearly mean that in the 90's ironic sense, but this self-fellating zine is a treasure map to every fossilized bone in their skeleton closet. They're gonna call us Laura Dern because we're about to get elbow deep in dino doo-doo. Get it, Morty? The gloves? You... You remember the big gloves?
6;6;Juricksic Mort;Morty;"Yeah, no, I get it, Rick. I said clever girl"" earlier. You didn't even react."""
6;6;Juricksic Mort;Rick;I was angry.
6;6;Juricksic Mort;Rick;Um, I'm looking for a few of my, uh, friends.
6;6;Juricksic Mort;Tamorusian;"Hmm. Kinda look like the Skullfeet"" that used to live on our planet way before us. They're long gone now."""
6;6;Juricksic Mort;Morty;Really? They're extinct here, too?
6;6;Juricksic Mort;Tamorusian;Yeah. We keep their bones in that museum over there.
6;6;Juricksic Mort;Morty;Um, wow.
6;6;Juricksic Mort;Rick;These guys aren't gonna be much help.
6;6;Juricksic Mort;Tamorusian;The leading theory is, the Skullfeet stepped on their own brains so much they straight-up died. Such a shame. Would have loved to hear them sing.
6;6;Juricksic Mort;Morty;Sing?
6;6;Juricksic Mort;Tamorusian;Yeah. We figured they used to hold huge outdoor concerts in their land amphitheater.
6;6;Juricksic Mort;Rick;You people are idiots.
6;6;Juricksic Mort;Tamorusian;Hey. We didn't have much to go by. Bones aren't big on conversation.
6;6;Juricksic Mort;Morty;Yeah, neither are you, pal.
6;6;Juricksic Mort;Ronkonkoman;The majestic Basketsaur. Aren't they incredible? We're even making a series of increasingly terrible movies about cloning them in a theme park.
6;6;Juricksic Mort;Morty;So what happened to them?
6;6;Juricksic Mort;Ronkonkoman;No idea. But we do know they all loved eating communal soup out of the Great Dirt Bowl.
6;6;Juricksic Mort;Rick;Starting to see a pattern here.
6;6;Juricksic Mort;Centaurusan;Breathtaking, aren't they? It's a common misconception that they roamed our planet. The truth is, they rolled. Street-style mostly. Some vert.
6;6;Juricksic Mort;Rick;"Lemme guess. There's a very large, deep circular indentation in which these Grindasaurs"" used to shred."""
6;6;Juricksic Mort;Centaurusan;We think they had a second brain in their butt, dedicated to pulling 1080s. 
6;6;Juricksic Mort;Rick;Three planets visited by dinosaurs, three apocalyptic meteor impacts. Gi... Gi... Gimme the board. I'm dropping in for data.
6;6;Juricksic Mort;Morty;Aah! Rick! That's the hardest thing in skateboarding.
6;6;Juricksic Mort;Rick;"Oh! Ow! It looked so easy on... Aah... Pro Skater 3"". Oww. Hello. Jackpot, Morty."""
6;6;Juricksic Mort;Morty;You still think the dinosaurs got something to hide?
6;6;Juricksic Mort;Rick;No, Morty, they have a reason to hide. Come here, ya little whippersnapper.
6;6;Juricksic Mort;Morty;No, Rick, stop!
6;6;Juricksic Mort;Rick;C'mere, Morty. Come on, gimme a hug.
6;6;Juricksic Mort;Morty;No, don't touch me. Your hands are greasy.
6;6;Juricksic Mort;Rick;What's the matter with you?
6;6;Juricksic Mort;Tyrannosaurus;It's become clear your species is having a hard time adjusting to its reduced accountability.
6;6;Juricksic Mort;Brachiosaurus;Our solution is to hold these regular keynotes, or talks, which you used to launch new phones and religions. Uhp, I see someone's eager to speak.
6;6;Juricksic Mort;Spectator;Hi. Um, what do you do when you want to kill yourself?
6;6;Juricksic Mort;Triceratops;You don't do that. Thank you for asking, though. Ver... Very important.
6;6;Juricksic Mort;Brachiosaurus;We recently discovered a new piece of human literature that we think everyone should read.
6;6;Juricksic Mort;Jerry;Holy shit! I'm a famous author! Wait, where's my name?
6;6;Juricksic Mort;Brachiosaurus;We will distribute it to everyone on Earth tomorrow.
6;6;Juricksic Mort;Jerry;Excuse me. Aren't you gonna say who wrote it?
6;6;Juricksic Mort;Brachiosaurus;Nope. Whoever wrote it must be above needing credit. It's all here in this book that belongs to everyone. For free.
6;6;Juricksic Mort;Jerry;You Communist lizard scumbags! I wrote that. Me, Jerry Smith!
6;6;Juricksic Mort;Rick;Hey, hey, hey! Guess what? Dinosaurs are not secretly evil, and they're not out to cause anybody trouble, but it turns out trouble has a way of following them.
6;6;Juricksic Mort;Robot Projector;Oh, yes, yes, yes. It's showtime.
6;6;Juricksic Mort;Rick;Literally every planet with dinosaurs on it is eventually smashed by a huge space rock that takes out them and most existing life.
6;6;Juricksic Mort;Brachiosaurus;What? That can't be true.
6;6;Juricksic Mort;Rick;It's all right to be frustrated. Let me explain. Why would planet-killing meteors follow dinosaurs? As these reptiles evolved to higher and higher levels of loving vegan godhood, another life-form devolved into an equally selfless, hate-filled species of barely sentient rocks. They hurtle through space and do as much damage as they can to their chosen enemy, which is guess who. Yup, everywhere these dinos go, these rocks, they come a-crashing. And this one... is headed directly towards us.
6;6;Juricksic Mort;Triceratops;And all of our work? It was for...
6;6;Juricksic Mort;Rick;Nothing. Bingo. Welcome to life. It's a big boat with a lot of holes, but we're all in it together.
6;6;Juricksic Mort;Brachiosaurus;Oh, my.
6;6;Juricksic Mort;Triceratops;Ohhhhh.
6;6;Juricksic Mort;Tyrannosaurus;Mm. So much death.
6;6;Juricksic Mort;Rick;Congratulations, primates. Looks like Earth could have done worse. Rick out. Oh. And don't forget to tune in to this year's Oscars.
6;6;Juricksic Mort;Brachiosaurus;Well, this is a... a lot to take in.
6;6;Juricksic Mort;Kid;I like trains now.
6;6;Juricksic Mort;Triceratops;Okay, that hurt.
6;6;Juricksic Mort;People;Trains rule! Dinos drool!
6;6;Juricksic Mort;Anders;And you had no idea about the disastrous meteors that followed in your wake?
6;6;Juricksic Mort;Brachiosaurus;We just learned about it like you. Truly heartbreaking news.
6;6;Juricksic Mort;Anders;But I assume you're gonna destroy it when it arrives here, right?
6;6;Juricksic Mort;Tyrannosaurus;Um, we're in the process of finding a solution that, um, doesn't involve violence.
6;6;Juricksic Mort;Anders;Hold on. You're in the process?! Well, there you have it, Cooperheads. An angry species of rock is gonna slam into our... Sorry... their planet, and our new planet runners are weighing whether to let it happen.
6;6;Juricksic Mort;Joe Rogan;I mean, no one knows if the meteor species is even real.
6;6;Juricksic Mort;Triceratops;No. It's very real. We all know that.
6;6;Juricksic Mort;Joe Rogan;You know what's real? A rear naked choke hold. I'll show you.
6;6;Juricksic Mort;Tyrannosaurus;Hmm?
6;6;Juricksic Mort;Brachiosaurus;What?
6;6;Juricksic Mort;Oprah Winfrey;Final question... How we doing?
6;6;Juricksic Mort;Triceratops;We have come to the conclusion the only way to ensure humanity will be safe is for us to go. We are leaving the planet for good.
6;6;Juricksic Mort;President;Maybe it's the Molly, but I fucking love you, Rick.
6;6;Juricksic Mort;Rick;It's the Molly.
6;6;Juricksic Mort;President;Isn't this nice? Rivalries behind us, dinos gone, two cool guys living in the moment. So, uh, like, uh you know what you're gonna wear? Because...
6;6;Juricksic Mort;Rick;I can't get another plus-one.
6;6;Juricksic Mort;President;What?! I'm the one who got you the gig, you son of a bitch! I feel this napkin... Feel this napkin. So soft.

6;6;Juricksic Mort;Rick;Suck my gray tits Hollywood pinkos. Where's the mic? The... The... The raising mic? Ha. Bring it up!

6;6;Juricksic Mort;Tom Hanks;"Okay, okay, one time. Wilson!"""""

6;6;Juricksic Mort;Rick;Yeah, told you it would.

6;6;Juricksic Mort;Space Beth;Ah, fucking Sprinkles coupon!
6;6;Juricksic Mort;Summer;We're splitting that.
6;6;Juricksic Mort;Morty;"Hey, so I was thinking it might be funny to add dinosaurs to the In Memoriam""."""
6;6;Juricksic Mort;Rick;Eh, it feels beneath us. It's funnier that they left and we don't even care.
6;6;Juricksic Mort;Summer;Oh, yeah, they left, but they keep begging for attention. You haven't heard? The dinos are just standing up there on Mars with their dicks in their hands. So dramatic.
6;6;Juricksic Mort;Rick;What, they're just gonna let the meteor hit them a-and die?
6;6;Juricksic Mort;Jerry;Good. If being superior to everyone makes you die, I call that balance. It's all in my globally published book the dinos stripped my name from!
6;6;Juricksic Mort;Rick;Ugggh. Oscars are over. Where are my keys? God damn it, I need to fix portal travel. And... And I'm going to. I have a process.
6;6;Juricksic Mort;Tyrannosaurus;Our final act of kindness.
6;6;Juricksic Mort;Brachiosaurus;It's been an honor serving the sanctity of life with you all.
6;6;Juricksic Mort;Triceratops;Rick, what are you doing?
6;6;Juricksic Mort;Rick;Standing here with you guys.
6;6;Juricksic Mort;Tyrannosaurus;You don't want to do that. We're sacrificing ourselves here.
6;6;Juricksic Mort;Rick;Then so am I. Y'know? Elon Musk be damned, we're blowing up Mars.
6;6;Juricksic Mort;Brachiosaurus;No. We're doing something selfless. You're doing it out of pettiness.
6;6;Juricksic Mort;Rick;How is anyone supposed to know the difference? Consider it a game of virtue chicken.
6;6;Juricksic Mort;Tyrannosaurus;Okay, if you won't go, we'll make you go.
6;6;Juricksic Mort;Rick;Oh. Sorry. I-I dino-proofed my tech to spite you guys. Which further proves selflessness and selfishness are two sides of the same coin, so what's the point? 
6;6;Juricksic Mort;Rick;Fine. Cool with me that your final chapter is dying on Mars with an old dickhead.
6;6;Juricksic Mort;Tyrannosaurus;Aaaah!
6;6;Juricksic Mort;Rick;All right! Welcome back.
6;6;Juricksic Mort;Tyrannosaurus;You obnoxious little twat!
6;6;Juricksic Mort;Rick;Yeah, but you're alive. No David Foster Wallace-ing in my galaxy. You don't get to be so smart that you remove yourself from everybody. From one god being to another, you're welcome. 
6;6;Juricksic Mort;Triceratops;Well, as long as we're doing each other favors...
6;6;Juricksic Mort;Rick;Hey. Wait, wait, wait. What are you doing? You fixed my rift? You fucking hypocritical cocks. I-It was all canonical and shit. We coulda milked that thing for a whole season. O-Or, like, a three-episode arc at least.
6;6;Juricksic Mort;Triceratops;Sorry. That's just us. We love helping, god beings to god being.
6;6;Juricksic Mort;Rick;Seriously. I was gonna fix that. Shit. They're coming back.
6;6;Juricksic Mort;Summer;Can we turn on the A.C.? It's, like, a thousand degrees outside. Yes! New follower. Named... CryptoForBareToes? Not sure I get it, but sounds like business.
6;6;Juricksic Mort;Beth;Proud of you, honey.
6;6;Juricksic Mort;Morty;Is Dad okay?

6;6;Juricksic Mort;Brachiosaurus;This is our home now. 
6;6;Juricksic Mort;Triceratops;We shall live out the rest of our days here. Never interfering with the ways of the universe again.
6;6;Juricksic Mort;Tyrannosaurus;We are content.
6;6;Juricksic Mort;Brachiosaurus;It was a good run.
6;6;Juricksic Mort;Triceratops;Speaking of a good run... I bet I could switch heel onto that manny pad, big spinout, tre flip that gap, 5-0 the rail, drop into the bowl, stalefish into a Christ Air, and then we get fucking wrecked.

6;7;Full Meta Jackrick;Rhett Caan;If you don't free me right now, Rick, I can make very, very bad things always have been the case for you.
6;7;Full Meta Jackrick;Rick;Is that a threat, you fuck? Y-Y-You can rot in there.
6;7;Full Meta Jackrick;Morty;Rick.
6;7;Full Meta Jackrick;Rick;You know what, Rhett? Forget what I said. We've always been friends.
6;7;Full Meta Jackrick;Rhett Caan;Good one.
6;7;Full Meta Jackrick;Connie TinuityError;Whoa, easy, Rhett. Don't forget that coffee mug I gave you.
6;7;Full Meta Jackrick;Rhett Caan;You always were able to be killed with coffee.
6;7;Full Meta Jackrick;Connie TinuityError;Aaah!
6;7;Full Meta Jackrick;Rick;New plan. Run. Again.
6;7;Full Meta Jackrick;Mr. Twist;The twist being...
6;7;Full Meta Jackrick;Rhett Caan;You were born without bones.
6;7;Full Meta Jackrick;Flash Back;See ya never!
6;7;Full Meta Jackrick;Rhett Caan;There's never been anything outside this fortress.
6;7;Full Meta Jackrick;Rick;God damn it!
6;7;Full Meta Jackrick;Rhett Caan;And this fortress has always been an orange!
6;7;Full Meta Jackrick;Morty;Pluh! Great plan, Rick!
6;7;Full Meta Jackrick;Rick;Yeah, I'm not pushing back on that, Morty, I have royally fucked us.
6;7;Full Meta Jackrick;Morty;Ugh! It hurts.
6;7;Full Meta Jackrick;Rick;We've been past the fourth wall too long. We won't be real much longer.
6;7;Full Meta Jackrick;Morty;You killed us, Rick. You just had to hate meta storytelling.
6;7;Full Meta Jackrick;Rick;In my defense, Morty, I think you can agree my hate was justified. Ohh!
6;7;Full Meta Jackrick;Morty;Least... earned... death... ever...
6;7;Full Meta Jackrick;Joseph Campbell;Death is a threshold.
6;7;Full Meta Jackrick;Morty;Ugh! What... What happened?
6;7;Full Meta Jackrick;Joseph Campbell;You atoned.
6;7;Full Meta Jackrick;Morty;Who... Who are you?
6;7;Full Meta Jackrick;Joseph Campbell;I'm Joseph Campbell. Soup? I almost considered not making it because my name is Campbell, but then I thought, stay in the moment, Joe. Follow your bliss.
6;7;Full Meta Jackrick;Rick;How are you here? R-Rhett Caan said there was nothing.
6;7;Full Meta Jackrick;Joseph Campbell;Some things never change about mythology. There's always an old man with soup. Name one story that doesn't have one.
6;7;Full Meta Jackrick;Morty;Uh, Jack and the Beanstalk.
6;7;Full Meta Jackrick;Rick;"Basketball Diaries""."""
6;7;Full Meta Jackrick;Morty;"Every Matrix""."""
6;7;Full Meta Jackrick;Rick;Every movie ever.
6;7;Full Meta Jackrick;Joseph Campbell;Alright, I don't have to defend myself to you people.
6;7;Full Meta Jackrick;Previous Leon;Where's my soup?
6;7;Full Meta Jackrick;Rick;Previous Fuckin' Leon. Why is that prick here?
6;7;Full Meta Jackrick;Joseph Campbell;No more a prick than you, friend. 
6;7;Full Meta Jackrick;Rick;Meta characters erode reality. 
6;7;Full Meta Jackrick;Joseph Campbell;But all characters are meta, Rick. All of us are nourished and consumed by chaos, like newborns at the breast of a meth addict in a lifeboat filled with forks.
6;7;Full Meta Jackrick;Morty;I know what you have to do, Rick.
6;7;Full Meta Jackrick;Rick;Scrub Campbell's browser history?
6;7;Full Meta Jackrick;Morty;Just trust Previous Leon. Could you previously us a way home?
6;7;Full Meta Jackrick;Previous Leon;Uh, well, I'll sure enjoy trying.
6;7;Full Meta Jackrick;Rick;Yeah, I bet you would.
6;7;Full Meta Jackrick;Joseph Campbell;Rick can't change, Morty. Change is what you might call his Kryptonite. Except instead of being super, he's, you know, kind of a pussy.
6;7;Full Meta Jackrick;Rick;Let's do it.
6;7;Full Meta Jackrick;Previous Leon;Previously, on Rick...
6;7;Full Meta Jackrick;Morty;Get him off! Get him off!
6;7;Full Meta Jackrick;Joseph Campbell;Oh, boy.
6;7;Full Meta Jackrick;Morty;He almost killed you!
6;7;Full Meta Jackrick;Joseph Campbell;Okay, well, I feel bad, I kind of pressured you into trying that.
6;7;Full Meta Jackrick;Rick;You called me a pussy.
6;7;Full Meta Jackrick;Joseph Campbell;I said I feel bad!
6;7;Full Meta Jackrick;Joseph Campbell;This is a map to a region rich in narrative ore. I wish you the best of luck.
6;7;Full Meta Jackrick;Rick;Faster, Morty! I'd help, but I can't blister my inventing hands.
6;7;Full Meta Jackrick;Morty;How long will it take?
6;7;Full Meta Jackrick;Rick;Years.
6;7;Full Meta Jackrick;Joseph Campbell;You can live in my wood shed. Just don't open the door after dark. 
6;7;Full Meta Jackrick;Morty;Why not?
6;7;Full Meta Jackrick;Joseph Campbell;Get out here, you Communist Jews!
6;7;Full Meta Jackrick;Rick;Dude. Maybe I'm not an alcoholic.
6;7;Full Meta Jackrick;Morty;I know, right? 
6;7;Full Meta Jackrick;Joseph Campbell;"You fucking Back to the Future"" rip-offs!"""
6;7;Full Meta Jackrick;Rick;It's ready.
6;7;Full Meta Jackrick;Morty;Rick, I should stay.
6;7;Full Meta Jackrick;Rick;Why?
6;7;Full Meta Jackrick;Morty;I'm pregnant. 
6;7;Full Meta Jackrick;Morty;What are you doing? It wasn't him, Rick! 
6;7;Full Meta Jackrick;Rick;Then who?!
6;7;Full Meta Jackrick;Previous Leon;Me! I never left. But you had to think all this happened to make that.
6;7;Full Meta Jackrick;Rick;And I can get this through the titles?
6;7;Full Meta Jackrick;Previous Leon;If you hang on tight.
6;7;Full Meta Jackrick;Morty;What about my beard and unborn child?
6;7;Full Meta Jackrick;Previous Leon;Let them go.
6;7;Full Meta Jackrick;Rick;Thank you, Leon.
6;7;Full Meta Jackrick;Joseph Campbell;When you get home, Rick, do some classic adventures. Like season one... 
6;7;Full Meta Jackrick;Rick;I'm so sick of that fucking note. What the fuck does it even mean?
6;7;Full Meta Jackrick;Morty;Ohh!
6;7;Full Meta Jackrick;Story Lord;Now, one last time. What's my motivation?
6;7;Full Meta Jackrick;Jan;Motivation. This machine will siphon it from everyone in the universe.
6;7;Full Meta Jackrick;Story Lord;Perfect. Greenlit. Launch it. Oh, I think it's working! Yes, I can feel it!
6;7;Full Meta Jackrick;Jan;Something I did is actually affecting someone!
6;7;Full Meta Jackrick;Employee;I don't want to work anymore.
6;7;Full Meta Jackrick;Employee;I do, but only as an excuse to not practice guitar.
6;7;Full Meta Jackrick;Alien Golf Player;Why don't we just write any number down on the score sheet?
6;7;Full Meta Jackrick;Alien Golf Player;Oh, why even do that?
6;7;Full Meta Jackrick;Employee;Wait, you have to register?
6;7;Full Meta Jackrick;Story Lord;Yes! I can feel it! I'm so motivated! I want... a lot!
6;7;Full Meta Jackrick;Rick;Story time's over.
6;7;Full Meta Jackrick;Story Lord;Ha! Hardly your decision.
6;7;Full Meta Jackrick;Rick;Did you seriously double down on motivation as your motivation?
6;7;Full Meta Jackrick;Jan;It's a good idea!
6;7;Full Meta Jackrick;Morty;There's no such thing! There's joyful and there's joyless, and we've had our fill of one.
6;7;Full Meta Jackrick;Rick;Morty, make that sweaty writer stop working while I kill off his character.
6;7;Full Meta Jackrick;Story Lord;I have never been more driven to destroy someone.
6;7;Full Meta Jackrick;Rick;Yeah, well, I'm driven to lower my blood sugar, but guess who's getting tacos after he kicks your ass? 
6;7;Full Meta Jackrick;Rick;So you're jacked. Who cares?
6;7;Full Meta Jackrick;Story Lord;Cum gutters.
6;7;Full Meta Jackrick;Rick;I don't like that phrase.
6;7;Full Meta Jackrick;Story Lord;I don't take notes. You can't beat me, Rick. I have one million times your motivation!
6;7;Full Meta Jackrick;Rick;So do those guys with the cellphone kiosks at the mall.
6;7;Full Meta Jackrick;Story Lord;The hair is wrong.
6;7;Full Meta Jackrick;Rick;Like you'd be picky about licensing.
6;7;Full Meta Jackrick;Story Lord;Actually, I would. I happen to believe that...
6;7;Full Meta Jackrick;Rick;You can do that?
6;7;Full Meta Jackrick;Story Lord;You got to want it.
6;7;Full Meta Jackrick;Morty;Come on, just stop. I-I don't want to fight you.
6;7;Full Meta Jackrick;Jan;Kid, I'm a writer that wrote something successful. So if you want me to give it up, you're gonna need a black belt or a big pair of tits.
6;7;Full Meta Jackrick;Morty;Yeah, well, I don't have those.
6;7;Full Meta Jackrick;Joseph Campbell;In the mythical sense, I have both.
6;7;Full Meta Jackrick;Morty;Joseph Campbell?
6;7;Full Meta Jackrick;Jan;Yeah, nice try. He died in the 80s.
6;7;Full Meta Jackrick;Joseph Campbell;Only you can see and hear me, Morty. Just repeat what I tell you.
6;7;Full Meta Jackrick;Morty;Okay. Sir, you're only proud of your creation's success because you want to be creative, but creation doesn't happen through gimmicks, technology, and distribution. It doesn't even happen through work. Creativity is frankly adjacent to mental illness and overlaps with it substantially. A lot of talented people kill themselves and all of them are miserable. The real gift is to be ungifted, and from what I saw in your Green Arrow spec script, that's the gift you were given.
6;7;Full Meta Jackrick;Jan;You couldn't have seen that.
6;7;Full Meta Jackrick;Morty;I'm Joseph Campbell. I saw it. 
6;7;Full Meta Jackrick;Jan;The villain was a placeholder. 
6;7;Full Meta Jackrick;Morty;I said I saw it, Jan. I didn't say I could get past page five. Y-Your villains aren't the problem. The problem is, when you write, you're a villain. If you want to be a hero, just stop.
6;7;Full Meta Jackrick;Employee;You know what? Maybe I will register.
6;7;Full Meta Jackrick;Story Lord;Say it! Tell me I'm the new Mr. Nimbus!
6;7;Full Meta Jackrick;Rick;Oh, looks like your writer took a hiatus.
6;7;Full Meta Jackrick;Story Lord;Oh, fuck.
6;7;Full Meta Jackrick;Rick;You're less motivated to fight now, so this is literally punching down, but you've got it coming.
6;7;Full Meta Jackrick;Story Lord;Please, let me live. I promise to be cooler. I'll be less inside baseball. Maybe I change my name? Ow!
6;7;Full Meta Jackrick;Story Lord;You failed me.
6;7;Full Meta Jackrick;Jan;No, I failed you. 
6;7;Full Meta Jackrick;Story Lord;All good things must come to an end-
6;7;Full Meta Jackrick;Rick;All bad things too, though, so don't flatter yourself.
6;7;Full Meta Jackrick;Morty;Jan, Joseph Campbell says you have to be the one to put him down.
6;7;Full Meta Jackrick;Rick;Wait, wait, wait, Joseph Campbell also says you have to use this brand-new limited edition Rick plush, available only on rick-plush.biz. Supplies are limited. Act now.
6;7;Full Meta Jackrick;Morty;He did? Jesus, that's the last time I buy a toy from a Rick.
6;7;Full Meta Jackrick;Rick;Ooh, the plushies are obviously well made.
6;7;Full Meta Jackrick;Morty;Thanks for getting us back alive, Rick.
6;7;Full Meta Jackrick;Rick;Well, I am a master of both worlds, Morty.
6;7;Full Meta Jackrick;Jan;Joseph Campbell told me to stop writing. Because it should be effortless. And when it happens organically, that's when it's meant to be. You know, like, um, like me. I'm a writer, here's a pencil. Writers use pencils. Okay, so, like, what if, like, a pencil used me? Like, um... okay! Yeah! Okay, so it's like a magic pencil that writes the writer's life... Holy shit, it's a movie about a writer! I am back!
6;7;Full Meta Jackrick;Tag-Man;"Yeah, I'm Tag-Man! I-I-I-I live in the tag! I-I-I am the tag! I'm Tag-Man! Tag... Tag of the episode... man! Did you get any of that?"" When the... yeah, when an episode's over, look out, because, ya a a ah, here comes Tag-Man! And I'm... I'm crazy! Tag-Man! Yeah! I'm... I'mma tag your ass!"""
6;7;Full Meta Jackrick;Tag-Man;Tag that ass. Tag-Ass-Man! I'm an Ass-Man now! I'm a... I'm a Tag-Man! Here's what you get. Here's your tag! Yeah, you want some more? You want... you want some more tag you sick piece of shit?! I'm... because I'm Tag-Man! I miss my wife. Too bad. This is it! Tag-Man, yeah!
6;8;Analyze Piss;Morty;I... I can't hold them off, Rick! Th-There's too many!
6;8;Analyze Piss;Mr. Nimbus;Richard! Your fortress is a salty waste of coral and clam. Relinquish it at once!
6;8;Analyze Piss;Rick;Aah!
6;8;Analyze Piss;Mr. Nimbus;Submit, you continental cunt.
6;8;Analyze Piss;Rick;Aah! Got a better idea.
6;8;Analyze Piss;Morty;Oh, shit! Oh, shit! Oh, shit! Oh, shit! Aah! Aah!
6;8;Analyze Piss;Rick;Happy? 
6;8;Analyze Piss;Mr. Nimbus;Of course I'm happy. You're acting like you won, but this is exactly what I wanted! I am Mr. Nimbus!
6;8;Analyze Piss;Rick;Ugh, whatever. Come on, Morty.
6;8;Analyze Piss;Morty;Man, that was intense.
6;8;Analyze Piss;Rick;Yeah, nice work, buddy. Sorry I had to blow up your bunker.
6;8;Analyze Piss;Cookie Magneto;Not so fast, Sanchez. It is I, Cookie Magneto.
6;8;Analyze Piss;Rick;What the fuck? I'm... I'm not engaging this guy.
6;8;Analyze Piss;Cookie Magneto;That's hardly up to you, Rick.
6;8;Analyze Piss;Morty;I'm sorry, do you control things that people agree are cookies?
6;8;Analyze Piss;Cookie Magneto;Yes. 
6;8;Analyze Piss;Morty;Okay, but cookies aren't a substance. They're more of a name we... we give to...
6;8;Analyze Piss;Cookie Magneto;To the things I control.
6;8;Analyze Piss;Morty;Do you control cookie ingredients? Because, y'know, t-that sounds dangerous. Y'know, everything has sugar in it.
6;8;Analyze Piss;Cookie Magneto;Fight me and find... Aah!
6;8;Analyze Piss;Morty;Jesus, Rick! 
6;8;Analyze Piss;Rick;I'm sorry, Morty. I know you're gonna say it's punching down, but I can't fight another of these 90s-style goofball super villains. I'm not the fucking Tick. I'm... I'm exhausted.
6;8;Analyze Piss;Morty;Okay, but i-if you really have a lot of these guys gunning for you, maybe you should look into what you're doing to...
6;8;Analyze Piss;Rick;Oh, don't start that crap, Morty. I don't do anything for these dip shits to seek me out.
6;8;Analyze Piss;Mr. Calypso;I am Mr. Calypso! Face me, you ugly, drunk, ugly piece of shit.
6;8;Analyze Piss;Rick;Okay, I might look into it.
6;8;Analyze Piss;Dr. Wong;Why don't you have a seat?
6;8;Analyze Piss;Rick;'Cause this isn't a therapy session. I-I'm just asking you what people in your racket say about handling this particular situation.
6;8;Analyze Piss;Dr. Wong;First, we'd want you to define the situation.
6;8;Analyze Piss;Rick;"I'm a walking target for a never-ending sea of angry nerdsthat think getting in a fight with me is some kind of... I don't know, platform? I mean, look at this guy. He shows up and calls me an ugly drunk."" Because of course that's the angle of attack that's gonna undo me, right? You don't shoot Batman in his fucking Batman logo."""
6;8;Analyze Piss;Dr. Wong;And you think locking this man in a chamber and milking him of cosmic fluid will somehow resolve this?
6;8;Analyze Piss;Rick;I think it's the best I can do to profit from a situation and maybe set an example.
6;8;Analyze Piss;Dr. Wong;But you've set this example many times and it's not changing your situation.
6;8;Analyze Piss;Rick;Yeah, yeah, yeah, and now you're gonna tell me to ignore them. But guess what? They want that too.
6;8;Analyze Piss;Dr. Wong;And why would they want to be ignored?
6;8;Analyze Piss;Rick;You really believe if I let a guy like this do whatever he wants, he gets bored and vanishes?
6;8;Analyze Piss;Dr. Wong;Rick, would you be interested in proving me wrong?
6;8;Analyze Piss;Rick;Yes! 
6;8;Analyze Piss;Dr. Wong;Then show me data. Ignore them for a week and see what happens.
6;8;Analyze Piss;Rick;You're on, bitch.
6;8;Analyze Piss;Dr. Wong;Is that man dead? 
6;8;Analyze Piss;Rick;Is everything in here confidential?
6;8;Analyze Piss;Dr. Wong;Everything but murder.
6;8;Analyze Piss;Rick;Then he's fine.
6;8;Analyze Piss;Morty;I mean, I-I think it's pretty big, you know? Big step for the big cheese.
6;8;Analyze Piss;Beth;Yeah, Dad, I'm impressed.
6;8;Analyze Piss;Rick;Can we not make it a big deal?
6;8;Analyze Piss;Jerry;It's worth celebrating, Rick. You accepted the concept of therapy without turning yourself into a pickle or a housefly.
6;8;Analyze Piss;Rick;Jerry, for fuck's sake, that was a regular fly in her office that day.
6;8;Analyze Piss;Jerry;What the hell? 
6;8;Analyze Piss;Pissmaster;Riiick! How 'bout a little piss?
6;8;Analyze Piss;Jerry;Rick, why is there a man shooting piss on our front lawn?
6;8;Analyze Piss;Rick;I'm sure he'll tell you.
6;8;Analyze Piss;Pissmaster;I am Pissmaster! Here to flush the toilet that is Rick Sanchez.
6;8;Analyze Piss;Jerry;He's spraying my lavender bush. My bees need that lavender!
6;8;Analyze Piss;Rick;Remember five seconds ago when you guys were stoked about me changing because it made you feel superior?
6;8;Analyze Piss;Pissmaster;Ooh, whole family's here. Who's that redhead? Wouldn't mind spraying her with a golden shower.
6;8;Analyze Piss;Summer;Oh, my God, what?
6;8;Analyze Piss;Beth;Hey!
6;8;Analyze Piss;Jerry;Okay, that's it!
6;8;Analyze Piss;Rick;Jerry, please think about this. If you fight this guy, I'm either an asshole for not helping or an asshole for helping.
6;8;Analyze Piss;Jerry;My daughter just got spoken of in porno terms, and I'll respond how I choose!
6;8;Analyze Piss;Morty;Wait, Dad, don't!
6;8;Analyze Piss;Beth;Honey!
6;8;Analyze Piss;Jerry;Hey.
6;8;Analyze Piss;Pissmaster;You want a piece of piss?
6;8;Analyze Piss;Jerry;If that's your stupid rude way of saying I have to fight you, I will.
6;8;Analyze Piss;Pissmaster;Take your shot, pussy.
6;8;Analyze Piss;Jerry;Don't talk to me that way. Go away!
6;8;Analyze Piss;Pissmaster;Make me. 
6;8;Analyze Piss;Jerry;Go away! Ow!
6;8;Analyze Piss;Beth;Careful, honey!
6;8;Analyze Piss;Pissmaster;Just stay down. I... I don't even know you.
6;8;Analyze Piss;Jerry;Yeah, you don't know me. But I'm gonna know your whole ass, you son of a gun.
6;8;Analyze Piss;Neighbour;Hey, none of that!
6;8;Analyze Piss;Neighbour;Break it up, guys! Hey! Come on! 
6;8;Analyze Piss;Jerry;Come on, you dirty motherfucker.
6;8;Analyze Piss;Pissmaster;No! No, no, no, no no! Stop! Aah! Uncle! Mercy! Mercy! Stop! I give up!
6;8;Analyze Piss;Jerry;Apologize to my daughter.
6;8;Analyze Piss;Pissmaster;For what?
6;8;Analyze Piss;Jerry;You know for what!
6;8;Analyze Piss;Pissmaster;I'm sorry! I'm sorry I sexualized you! It came out wrong!
6;8;Analyze Piss;Summer;That's my dad. That's my fucking dad!
6;8;Analyze Piss;Beth;Honey, I'm so proud of you.
6;8;Analyze Piss;Jerry;Ow! 
6;8;Analyze Piss;Beth;Oh, sorry.
6;8;Analyze Piss;Jerry;Thank you, Rick.
6;8;Analyze Piss;Morty;Damn, hashtag #FlamingoDad is everywhere!
6;8;Analyze Piss;Summer;Buzzfeed made an odd numbered list of other people's observations about you, and you're getting a lot of hand clap emojis on White Twitter's impression of Black Twitter.
6;8;Analyze Piss;Beth;Jezebel's offering a cash reward for evidence that you're a bad person. That is their highest honor!
6;8;Analyze Piss;Jerry;So this is what it's like to trend. Feels good. Feels right.
6;8;Analyze Piss;Rick;Just keep in mind, now a bunch more assholes are gonna know they can get a rise out of you.
6;8;Analyze Piss;Beth;Boooo! 
6;8;Analyze Piss;Summer;Boooo! 
6;8;Analyze Piss;Morty;Rick, let a dog have one day.
6;8;Analyze Piss;Rick;I'm letting! I'm letting!
6;8;Analyze Piss;Summer;Whoa. Are those orbs?
6;8;Analyze Piss;Rick;This is what I'm talking about. Some asshole saw that fight and, believe it not, they were jealous of Pissmaster.
6;8;Analyze Piss;Blagnar the Eternal;I am Blagnar the Eternal. We seek the earthling who beat up Pissmaster.
6;8;Analyze Piss;Summer;That's my dad, Jerry Smith!
6;8;Analyze Piss;Blagnar the Eternal;Jerry Smith. Our Galactic Orbship thirsts for justice and those who deliver it.
6;8;Analyze Piss;Rick;Wait, what?
6;8;Analyze Piss;Blagnar the Eternal;Our great council would like to offer you this silver orb and with it a place amongst us.
6;8;Analyze Piss;Jerry;Whoa. It... It... It's sticky.
6;8;Analyze Piss;Galactic Orbship Agent;Yeah, that means it's found a pure heart it wants to bond with.
6;8;Analyze Piss;Rick;Y-You guys saw my son-in-law on the news, now he gets a sticky orb. What's the catch? We're not rubes.
6;8;Analyze Piss;Galactic Orbship Agent;Yeah, your power is well known in our jurisdiction, Rick Sanchez, and it should come as no surprise that our orbs are unsticky for you.
6;8;Analyze Piss;Rick;Oh, no, first I get banned from the Next door app, now this.
6;8;Analyze Piss;Jerry;I'd be honored to join your organization. S-So what do I do? Rub the orb when I see crime? Or... Or eat the orb like spinach?
6;8;Analyze Piss;Blagnar the Eternal;The orb is raw power. Trust your heart, Jerry. It will know what to do.
6;8;Analyze Piss;Summer;Did you turn on the microwave?
6;8;Analyze Piss;Jerry;No? Maybe? I... I was trying to fly. I...
6;8;Analyze Piss;Rick;What? 
6;8;Analyze Piss;Jerry;Come on, Rick. Orbs and goblets, this is your thing.
6;8;Analyze Piss;Rick;Orbs and goblets.
6;8;Analyze Piss;Jerry;I'm just saying, you're the orb guy in the family. Can you please help me?
6;8;Analyze Piss;Rick;Jerry, I give you raw power, you'll end up miserable like me. Trust me, I'm helping by not helping.
6;8;Analyze Piss;Beth;Wow.
6;8;Analyze Piss;Morty;Seriously, Rick?
6;8;Analyze Piss;Summer;What the eff, Grandpa? Some creep tried to pee on my tits and you did nothing. Now you're gonna sit there and hold our dad back from being a hero? Are you seriously that petty?
6;8;Analyze Piss;Rick;Okay, you know what? Fine! Here. Here's your goddamn suit. I hard-wired the orb's infinite energy right into it.
6;8;Analyze Piss;Jerry;This shooty-thing looks cool.
6;8;Analyze Piss;Rick;"That shooty thing"" is a nuclear disruptor that can blow up planets. """
6;8;Analyze Piss;Morty;Whoa.
6;8;Analyze Piss;Summer;So tight. 
6;8;Analyze Piss;Beth;Kinda hot.
6;8;Analyze Piss;Jerry;"Okay, show me, uh... acts of evil happening around the galaxy. Whoa, Space Hitlers? Space Hitlers are convening on Zeplar Prime."" My God, each one of them is their own type of Hitler."""
6;8;Analyze Piss;Morty;Yeah, th-that's a problem.
6;8;Analyze Piss;Summer;Oh, shit, do that one.
6;8;Analyze Piss;Summer;Aw, you guys. 
6;8;Analyze Piss;Morty;That's my parents.
6;8;Analyze Piss;Jerry;Wow. Well, family, looks like Jerry Smith has his first orb mission. Lawn Flaming-Ho!
6;8;Analyze Piss;Rick;Just a reminder, you guys asked for this.
6;8;Analyze Piss;Praying Mantis Hitler;Soon, our legion of Hitlers will bring about a new galactic order. A reich, if you will.
6;8;Analyze Piss;Riddle Hitler;Riddle Hitler me this...
6;8;Analyze Piss;Old Hitler;I'm sorry, are we just letting in all Hitlers now?
6;8;Analyze Piss;Jerry;Auf wiedersehen, bad guys!
6;8;Analyze Piss;Praying Mantis Hitler;Exterminate him!
6;8;Analyze Piss;Jerry;Ow! Shit! Oh, Jesus. One at a time! Ah, oh, my God! Uh, hope there weren't other people on that planet.
6;8;Analyze Piss;Alien Newscaster;And there were no other people on the planet! Only Hitlers! Each one ready to start their own holocaust, meaning an estimated 30 billion lives were saved by a single blast. And the galaxy owes it all to Jerry Smith. Hashtag #FlamingoDad.
6;8;Analyze Piss;Rick;You gotta be fucking kidding me.
6;8;Analyze Piss;Alien Newscaster;Up next... Oh, actually nothing. I guess we're just gonna talk about Jerry Smith some more.
6;8;Analyze Piss;Mr. Goldenfold;I dunno, therapy is starting to feel hopeless. I've got so many issues! Aah!
6;8;Analyze Piss;Rick;We need to talk.
6;8;Analyze Piss;Dr. Wong;Hey. No. I will not speak with you if you refuse to treat me and my patients with respect.
6;8;Analyze Piss;Mr. Goldenfold;Oh, Lord. I was a fly! So unburdened, so free of shame! Welp, I'm officially cured!
6;8;Analyze Piss;Rick;Here. Here's your data. Hard proof that God hates me. I ignored a troll, and Jerry beat the guy's ass. Now he's got this orb and he's using the power which I gave him to annihilate planets of Hitlers, and everyone's opping champagne.
6;8;Analyze Piss;Dr. Wong;Rick, you came here because you wanted things to change, and they're changing. It's working.
6;8;Analyze Piss;Rick;"Oh, so if my bumbling moron of a son-in-law beats up people, it's working"". But if I do it, it's a cosmic abuse of power?"""
6;8;Analyze Piss;Dr. Wong;Rick, listen to yourself. You're complaining about how you have to be careful with your immense power and that Hitlers are dead. Everything you're describing is positive.
6;8;Analyze Piss;Rick;Oh, shit. Not reacting. That really is the kill move?
6;8;Analyze Piss;Dr. Wong;I don't know if you need to think about it in terms of murder, but, yes, just stay the course.
6;8;Analyze Piss;Rick;Okay, good... good talk.
6;8;Analyze Piss;Dr. Wong;Well, what you're describing is therapy, and if you'd like to keep receiving it, start scheduling your visits with Judy up front.
6;8;Analyze Piss;Jerry;"Thank you, thank you, Flamingo Fam. Uh, you know, when they asked me if I wanted to be the first human to drive a Mitsubishi Space Lancer, I thought, Well, I don't know. I got this cool orb suit that goes really fast"". But you know what sold me? The Council said I could pick my own bridge crew. Morty, Summer, Beth, what do you say?"""
6;8;Analyze Piss;Beth;What? Are you serious?
6;8;Analyze Piss;Summer;Oh, shit, yeah, I love Mitsubishi!
6;8;Analyze Piss;Morty;Me too! I-I've heard of them! 
6;8;Analyze Piss;Beth;This is so exciting!
6;8;Analyze Piss;Summer;Oh, my God! This is so cool!
6;8;Analyze Piss;Jerry;Alright gang, orbs away!
6;8;Analyze Piss;Mr. String Bean;O me o' my, can it be? A giant piece of shit I see? I am Mr. String Bean! No one resists my rhyming scheme!
6;8;Analyze Piss;Doctor Buckles;Hey, douche bag, why don't you chill out?
6;8;Analyze Piss;Mr. String Bean;Who's this asshole?
6;8;Analyze Piss;Doctor Buckles;I am Doctor Buckles! Here to tighten the belt on your opinions!
6;8;Analyze Piss;Mr. String Bean;Oh, you wanna see the Bean get mean? Aah!
6;8;Analyze Piss;Rick;I'll be damned. I'm out. I'm out. I'm... I'm out.
6;8;Analyze Piss;Alien Girl;Oh, my God, this Piss Guy is getting wailed on.
6;8;Analyze Piss;Alien Girl;Oh! Look at him, he tried to crawl under the car! What a loser. 
6;8;Analyze Piss;Alien Bartender;Hey you watching the Pissmaster video?
6;8;Analyze Piss;Alien Girl;Yeah. 
6;8;Analyze Piss;Alien Girl;He has to be the biggest piece of shit in the galaxy, right?
6;8;Analyze Piss;Alien Bartender;Oh-ho, without a doubt. Who could relate, being that much of a piece of shit?
6;8;Analyze Piss;Rick;God damn it. Fuck, shit, come on, man. Fuck, come on, where is it? Shit, shit. Ugh! Fuck! Come on, Pissmaster, come on. Damn it.
6;8;Analyze Piss;Pissmaster's Daughter;It's me. Please, please just open up. Dad? Mom told me you weren't responding to her calls and I'm worried, okay? I know I said terrible things about you on my podcast. It's just... I've been so frustrated with you. Look, if you were to ever do something, I'd never stop blaming myself. Just, please. Please let me know you're okay.
6;8;Analyze Piss;Rick;God damn it.
6;8;Analyze Piss;Rick;I'm okay, honey. We're good.
6;8;Analyze Piss;Pissmaster's Daughter;I thought something happened to you.
6;8;Analyze Piss;Rick;I can tell you for sure... If anything happens to me, it's 100% not on you. It's my own choice. 
6;8;Analyze Piss;Pissmaster's Daughter;You still sound like you're gonna do something bad. Just promise you won't, okay?
6;8;Analyze Piss;Rick;Okay, yeah. Promise.
6;8;Analyze Piss;Pissmaster's Daughter;Love you, Dad.
6;8;Analyze Piss;Rick;Fuck.
6;8;Analyze Piss;Pissmaster;Well, this is it. I'm killing myself because of Jerry Smith. The Earth man. FlamingoDad. Seeing them all cheer as I got my ass whipped made me realize... People just wanna see me fail. All I've ever wanted to do is prove them wrong.
6;8;Analyze Piss;Woman;Help!
6;8;Analyze Piss;Woman;Wait! Who are you?
6;8;Analyze Piss;Rick;Pissmaster. M-Make, make sure you tell everybody Pissmaster saved you. Those were heat-seeking pissiles by the way. Not just missiles.
6;8;Analyze Piss;Woman;Oh, ugh, okay.
6;8;Analyze Piss;Reporter;Yo! Pissmaster! You saving that cat to make people forget you suck?
6;8;Analyze Piss;Rick;Nope, just saving it to save it.
6;8;Analyze Piss;Reporter;Okay, we got nothing.
6;8;Analyze Piss;Alien Guy;Look, it's Pissmaster!
6;8;Analyze Piss;Rick;Dr. Wong, what's up?
6;8;Analyze Piss;Dr. Wong;Rick, you're late for your session.
6;8;Analyze Piss;Rick;Cancel it. Bill me. I'm good. 
6;8;Analyze Piss;Dr. Wong;You're good?
6;8;Analyze Piss;Rick;Yeah, see, I put on the suit of my enemy and I fucking love it. Now I'm gonna make a giant bomb, plant it in a city, and then have his suit auto-pilot the bomb into space. Boom. Everyone will think Pissmaster sacrificed himself. He dies a hero, I get a win I'd otherwise never get myself, nice wet bow on top.
6;8;Analyze Piss;Dr. Wong;I'm tempted to second guess a lot of that, but I think you might be nailing it.
6;8;Analyze Piss;Rick;What? 
6;8;Analyze Piss;Dr. Wong;If it's free and fun, do it. It sounds healthy.
6;8;Analyze Piss;Rick;Oh, that wasn't my goal, but good to know. Shit, gotta go.
6;8;Analyze Piss;Galactic Orbship Agent; No, exactly. And the slave planet thing, I hear he broke their chains with pure urine, so...
6;8;Analyze Piss;Jerry;Hey, guys, sorry I'm late, lot of traffic on the orbway.
6;8;Analyze Piss;Blagnar the Eternal;Take a seat, Jerry. We were just discussing Pissmaster's honorable rise.
6;8;Analyze Piss;Jerry;I mean, who cares, right?
6;8;Analyze Piss;Galactic Orbship Agent;Uh, people are talking about him. He's becoming likable. Good, even.
6;8;Analyze Piss;Jerry;But... he's Pissmaster.
6;8;Analyze Piss;Galactic Orbship Agent;People change, Jerry. Everyone loves a comeback story. 
6;8;Analyze Piss;Blagnar the Eternal;All in favor of offering orbship to Eugene Michael Piss, aka Pissmaster?
6;8;Analyze Piss;Galactic Orbship Agent;Orb-yes!
6;8;Analyze Piss;Blagnar the Eternal;All those opposed?
6;8;Analyze Piss;Jerry;Obviously orb-no.
6;8;Analyze Piss;Blagnar the Eternal;The orbship has spoken. You know what, Jerry? I think this is a good test for you. If you can't let go of your pettiness enough to recruit Pissmaster, maybe you don't deserve your orb. And, Jerry... don't come back without him.
6;8;Analyze Piss;Reporter;Absolute chaos! No one knows who planted the bomb, but one thing is clear - Orphan Island, a city populated entirely by orphans, now sits on the brink of doom. The Orphan Island bomb squad is trying to dismantle it as we speak.
6;8;Analyze Piss;Orphan;I can't stress enough, I'm eight years old, I have no idea what I'm doing!
6;8;Analyze Piss;Orphan;Look! It's Pissmaster!
6;8;Analyze Piss;Rick;Oh, no! There's no time to dismantle it! Come on, it's not safe here.
6;8;Analyze Piss;Orphan;Whoa, oh, oh! Whoo-hoo!
6;8;Analyze Piss;Rick;Pisspop? Pisspop? Pisspop?
6;8;Analyze Piss;Jerry;Pissmaster. 
6;8;Analyze Piss;Rick;Jerry, what are you doing here?
6;8;Analyze Piss;Jerry;Eugene Michael Piss, by decree of the Andromeda strain, our great council presents you with this orb, which you have to take.
6;8;Analyze Piss;Rick;Fuck off, Jerry, I'm in the middle of something. 
6;8;Analyze Piss;Jerry;Excuse me? Hey, this is the greatest honor you could ever be given.
6;8;Analyze Piss;Rick;I don't want it!
6;8;Analyze Piss;Jerry;Well, you have to take it.
6;8;Analyze Piss;Rick;Jesus Christ, get the fuck out of here!
6;8;Analyze Piss;Orphan;He's flying it into space! He's gonna sacrifice himself!
6;8;Analyze Piss;Jerry;Get back here, you ungrateful shit!
6;8;Analyze Piss;Rick;What is your problem?! You're screwing up my hero death! 
6;8;Analyze Piss;Jerry;Good!
6;8;Analyze Piss;Orphan;FlamingoDad wants us to blow up?! When did he become a shitheel?
6;8;Analyze Piss;Orphan;Life comes at you fast.
6;8;Analyze Piss;Summer;Jesus, Dad! People are filming!
6;8;Analyze Piss;Morty;Yeah, maybe dial it back?
6;8;Analyze Piss;Jerry;Rick?
6;8;Analyze Piss;Rick;PissSuit! Auto-pilot the payload!
6;8;Analyze Piss;Piss A.I.;Confirmed.
6;8;Analyze Piss;Pissmaster's Daughter;That's my fucking dad.
6;8;Analyze Piss;Summer;Jerry?! Dad?! Are you okay?
6;8;Analyze Piss;Jerry;Your father is the fucking Pissmaster!
6;8;Analyze Piss;Summer;Um... Grandpa? What the hell?
6;8;Analyze Piss;Blagnar the Eternal;Jerry, what is this? People are saying you turned shitheel?
6;8;Analyze Piss;Jerry;Well, apparently my father-in-law is Pissmaster, so why don't you ask him?
6;8;Analyze Piss;Galactic Orbship Agent;What the...? Rick Sanchez the Pissmaster? Okay, this is not a good look.
6;8;Analyze Piss;Blagnar the Eternal;This family, man. Look, I don't know what kinda weird shit you two are pulling, but it's completely unstickworthy. We're done here.
6;8;Analyze Piss;Jerry;But I didn't know! I-I'm a good guy. I... I made you all famous!
6;8;Analyze Piss;Blagnar the Eternal;"I'm 1000 years old. You know how many Flamingo Dads"" I've seen? Don't orb us."""
6;8;Analyze Piss;Jerry;I don't get it. You... You were Pissmaster the whole time?
6;8;Analyze Piss;Rick;Obviously not, Jerry. I put the suit on once Pissmaster kill... Uh, when... when you made him... Uh, yeah. I-I've always been Pissmaster.
6;8;Analyze Piss;Summer;But that would mean you let my dad beat you up just so he could, like, feel more confident? Wow. 
6;8;Analyze Piss;Morty;Damn, Rick.
6;8;Analyze Piss;Beth;Yeah, that's amazing.
6;8;Analyze Piss;Jerry;Hold on, Wh... Everyone's just accepting this? Wait. Wasn't Pissmaster an alien?
6;8;Analyze Piss;Summer;He obviously avatar'd it. 
6;8;Analyze Piss;Morty;Probably a robot.
6;8;Analyze Piss;Jerry;But why? Why would Rick even prop me up like that?
6;8;Analyze Piss;Beth;Jesus, Jerry. Rick did something nice for once, okay? He's obviously trying to change.
6;8;Analyze Piss;Mitsubishi Ship;You are no longer worthy of Mitsubishi.
6;8;Analyze Piss;Beth;"Proud of you, Dad. Or should I say - Pissmaster."""
6;8;Analyze Piss;Summer;Yeah, Grandpa, sorry I yelled at you.
6;8;Analyze Piss;Jerry;And I guess I'm sorry for trying to stop you from killing yourself with a nuclear bomb. I just... really liked having an orb.
6;8;Analyze Piss;Rick;Eh. Don't sweat it, Jer. Piss under the bridge.
6;8;Analyze Piss;Morty;Man, I guess the therapy worked, huh? Opening up, doing all that just to make my dad feel good. That's pretty great of you, Rick.
6;8;Analyze Piss;Rick;Yeah... that's right, Morty. That's right. Wait, Morty. You have to promise not to tell anyone, but your dad made Pissmaster kill himself.
6;8;Analyze Piss;Morty;Oh, man, what?! 
6;8;Analyze Piss;Rick;Yeah, I mean, I found him dead and I... I put on his suit, but look at this... He literally blames your dad.
6;8;Analyze Piss;Morty;Holy shit. Wait, you kept the suicide note? That's so messed up! 
6;8;Analyze Piss;Rick;I know, I mean, I had to tell someone, Morty. I couldn't just sit on that.
6;8;Analyze Piss;Morty;And you expect me to?
6;8;Analyze Piss;Rick;Morty, no! What are you doing?!
6;8;Analyze Piss;Jerry;Aah! What the hell?! He killed himself?
6;8;Analyze Piss;Beth;Jesus, Dad, you should've told us! Especially if Jerry murdered him!
6;8;Analyze Piss;Jerry;Wait, don't say that, I... I didn't murder!
6;8;Analyze Piss;Rick;Hey, I... I thought it was pretty cool that I withheld that information.
6;8;Analyze Piss;Morty;But you didn't withhold it! You're walking around with the note! 
6;8;Analyze Piss;Summer;Yeah, Grandpa, you gotta, like, keep it in your heart as a great sacrifice. That's the cool move. 
6;8;Analyze Piss;Jerry;I mean, how am I the bad guy? He sprayed piss on us! You... You all cheered me on! 
6;8;Analyze Piss;Beth;Don't drag us into this.
6;8;Analyze Piss;Summer;A man is dead, Dad.
6;8;Analyze Piss;Rick;Again, wasn't gonna say it, but I told you this would happen.
6;8;Analyze Piss;Beth;Get off your high horse. 
6;8;Analyze Piss;Summer;Boooo!
6;8;Analyze Piss;Morty;Dr. Wong would be so proud.
6;8;Analyze Piss;Rick;Go ahead and boo. I was breathing piss, you think I care?
6;8;Analyze Piss;Jerry;Is this what it's like to trend? This is a nightmare! I should've just let him pee on my daughter!
6;8;Analyze Piss;Summer;Ew! What the hell, Dad?
6;8;Analyze Piss;Blagnar the Eternal;How about Jack Miller, aka Car Jack? He lifted a car off a stranger.
6;8;Analyze Piss;Galactic Orbship Agent;Eh.
6;8;Analyze Piss;Galactic Orbship Agent;I guess.
6;8;Analyze Piss;Galactic Orbship Agent;Next.
6;8;Analyze Piss;Galactic Orbship Agent;Orb-no.
6;8;Analyze Piss;Galactic Orbship Agent;We're fresh off a dad and a piss guy. Maybe we add someone that's already powerful?
6;8;Analyze Piss;Blagnar the Eternal; We have to be realistic about who we can get.
6;8;Analyze Piss;Galactic Orbship Agent;I have a pitch. 
6;8;Analyze Piss;Blagnar the Eternal;We're not gonna add Scarlett Johansson. Next up - Mr. Nimbus, lord of the oceans.
6;8;Analyze Piss;Galactic Orbship Agent;Oh, I hear he controls the police.
6;8;Analyze Piss;Galactic Orbship Agent;Wow.
6;8;Analyze Piss;Galactic Orbship Agent;The police?
6;8;Analyze Piss;Galactic Orbship Agent;Orb-yes.
6;8;Analyze Piss;Galactic Orbship Agent;Ohhh.
6;8;Analyze Piss;Galactic Orbship Agent;Guys, I already checked. His reps say he's really busy right now.
6;8;Analyze Piss;Galactic Orbship Agent;He just doesn't wanna do it.
6;8;Analyze Piss;Galactic Orbship Agent;Everyone says that.
6;8;Analyze Piss;Blagnar the Eternal;Oh, and we're not busy?
6;9;A Rick in King Mortur's Mort;Rick;Why are we waiting in line for food?
6;9;A Rick in King Mortur's Mort;Morty;t's a pop-up. It's a rare, pop-up restaurant thing that only enters our solar system... Rick. You're gonna spoil your appetite.
6;9;A Rick in King Mortur's Mort;Rick;That's a weird way to say I'm gonna stop being hungry by eating food, but whatever. Three crispy, uh, four wiggling.
6;9;A Rick in King Mortur's Mort;Morty;You're probably not even hungry. You just don't like lines because they aren't about you.
6;9;A Rick in King Mortur's Mort;Rick;Another weirdly aggressive way to describe a friend respecting themselves.
6;9;A Rick in King Mortur's Mort;Morty;Eugh!
6;9;A Rick in King Mortur's Mort;Sir Helios;What a wonderful thing to say! 
6;9;A Rick in King Mortur's Mort;Knight Of The Sun;Ha ha! I was merely inspired by the wonderful thing you said!
6;9;A Rick in King Mortur's Mort;Morty;Sirs? Guys? You dropped this.
6;9;A Rick in King Mortur's Mort;Sir Helios;Please, take it as a reward. So courteous!
6;9;A Rick in King Mortur's Mort;Knight Of The Sun;How nice it will be for you to eat what you were willing to stand in line for so much sooner.
6;9;A Rick in King Mortur's Mort;Morty;Oh, no, that's okay. I came to stand in line and then eat. I-I wouldn't wanna do it differently.
6;9;A Rick in King Mortur's Mort;Sir Helios;Hmm... Dear fellow, I choose this moment to surrender my sword so that you may succeed me as the newest Knight of the Sun.
6;9;A Rick in King Mortur's Mort;Morty;What? No. I-I-I didn't even want your sandwich. I don't want your sword.
6;9;A Rick in King Mortur's Mort;Knight Of The Sun;Oh, believe me, son. You want it.
6;9;A Rick in King Mortur's Mort;Morty;"I don't understand. You're knights? With a K""? Of the Sun with a ""U"" or... or an ""O""?"""
6;9;A Rick in King Mortur's Mort;Knight Of The Sun;Your alphabet is of no concern here. We are sworn defenders of Helios, the center of this system.
6;9;A Rick in King Mortur's Mort;Morty;"Okay, so it's Sun"" with a ""U."""""
6;9;A Rick in King Mortur's Mort;Rick;Oh, God. Morty, don't take the sword.
6;9;A Rick in King Mortur's Mort;Morty;Oh, I'm shocked you're against something, Rick. You know these guys?
6;9;A Rick in King Mortur's Mort;Rick;I know how they're dressed and how boring this sounds. You take that sword, you're gonna get sucked into a whole complicated... Oh, shit!
6;9;A Rick in King Mortur's Mort;Sir Helios;Come on, take it.
6;9;A Rick in King Mortur's Mort;Food Vendor;Uh... I mean, if that kid's not gonna take the sword... 
6;9;A Rick in King Mortur's Mort;Morty;He didn't offer it to you. Sorry. Can I just ask some stuff? W-What does a Knight of the Sun do?
6;9;A Rick in King Mortur's Mort;Sir Helios;He takes the sword, for one thing.
6;9;A Rick in King Mortur's Mort;Knight Of The Sun;You know what? Maybe you made a bad call. He... He doesn't want the sword.
6;9;A Rick in King Mortur's Mort;Morty;I didn't say that.
6;9;A Rick in King Mortur's Mort;Knight Of The Sun;Well, you sure aren't taking it.
6;9;A Rick in King Mortur's Mort;Morty;Would you just take a random...
6;9;A Rick in King Mortur's Mort;Knight Of The Sun;Obviously I would, yes! And I did! Best decision of my life! And you're shitting on it!
6;9;A Rick in King Mortur's Mort;Alien Guy;Excuse me? Is this just a free sword?
6;9;A Rick in King Mortur's Mort;Knight Of The Sun;No!
6;9;A Rick in King Mortur's Mort;Morty;I'm taking the sword.
6;9;A Rick in King Mortur's Mort;Sir Helios;Thank you, Dawnling. What is your name?
6;9;A Rick in King Mortur's Mort;Morty;Morty.
6;9;A Rick in King Mortur's Mort;Sir Helios;Now it is Sir Mortaniel. I made it a little knightier. Good day.
6;9;A Rick in King Mortur's Mort;Morty;Wait, did he just...
6;9;A Rick in King Mortur's Mort;Rick;God damn it, Morty! You took the sword? So boring!
6;9;A Rick in King Mortur's Mort;Morty;Oh, like you're not at this point? You drunk cranky fuck!
6;9;A Rick in King Mortur's Mort;Rick;Ouch. You guys still gonna stand in line? Y-You're not gonna take this food?
6;9;A Rick in King Mortur's Mort;Alien Guy;The pop-up pays us to stand here. To drive up business.
6;9;A Rick in King Mortur's Mort;Rick;Knew it!
6;9;A Rick in King Mortur's Mort;Knight Of The Sun;Everyone! Sir Helios' successor, Sir Mortaniel!
6;9;A Rick in King Mortur's Mort;Knight Of The Sun;Sir Mortaniel, face so bright! Serves the Sun with strength and might! Sir Mortaniel, come and see! Just what the Sun provides for thee!
6;9;A Rick in King Mortur's Mort;Morty;Wow, my... my own song!
6;9;A Rick in King Mortur's Mort;Knight Of The Sun;Now you know why Sir Helios had to change your name to something with three syllables. Welcome, Dawnling, to the Sun!
6;9;A Rick in King Mortur's Mort;Morty;So it is the Sun, like Earth's sun?
6;9;A Rick in King Mortur's Mort;Knight Of The Sun;Ah-ha, he's heard of us!
6;9;A Rick in King Mortur's Mort;Morty;How come I'm not, like, burning to a crisp?
6;9;A Rick in King Mortur's Mort;Knight Of The Sun;You are currently protected by our powers, but soon they will be yours. Our flesh is indestructible! Our lives are never-ending, but not even in the dumb vampire way where after a while you hate it and you can't die. We can die whenever we want. We just don't have to.
6;9;A Rick in King Mortur's Mort;Morty;But you're not allowed to leave, right? L-Like, I'll... I'll... I'll never see my family again?
6;9;A Rick in King Mortur's Mort;Knight Of The Sun;We leave constantly! I met you on an asteroid.
6;9;A Rick in King Mortur's Mort;Morty;Oh, yeah. Between us, that wasn't a deal breaker, but it's even better that there's options.
6;9;A Rick in King Mortur's Mort;King Of The Sun;You'll have more freedom than you've ever known.
6;9;A Rick in King Mortur's Mort;Knight Of The Sun;Our king. The Sun is the center of the solar system. It is the home of the solar Scepter, around which all worlds revolve. The men who keep it safe are admired by all and live as gods. Any more questions?
6;9;A Rick in King Mortur's Mort;Morty;Uh, yeah, where do I sign?
6;9;A Rick in King Mortur's Mort;Knight Of The Sun;Huzzah! 
6;9;A Rick in King Mortur's Mort;King Of The Sun;Well, that does it. Off to the parapet to make this official.
6;9;A Rick in King Mortur's Mort;Morty;Yeah, let's do this!
6;9;A Rick in King Mortur's Mort;Knight Of The Sun;Now just cut off your penises and throw them into the Sun.
6;9;A Rick in King Mortur's Mort;Morty;Oooooooookey-do key.
6;9;A Rick in King Mortur's Mort;Knight Of The Sun;I see Mortaniel wants to go first.
6;9;A Rick in King Mortur's Mort;Morty;Uh, not true. Do I just leave the sword wherever? I-Is there a sword bin?
6;9;A Rick in King Mortur's Mort;Knight Of The Sun;What are you saying? You don't want to cut off... 
6;9;A Rick in King Mortur's Mort;Morty;Listen, guys, c-can we not...
6;9;A Rick in King Mortur's Mort;Knight Of The Sun;It's a terrific and painful sacrifice we all make for the most important and powerful job in the universe. We've done it since the dawn of dawns.
6;9;A Rick in King Mortur's Mort;Morty;Yep. There it is in stained glass. It's official. A-And I'm not judging it. And I'm not doing it.
6;9;A Rick in King Mortur's Mort;Rick;People really live here? This is nuts. I thought it was a metaphor.
6;9;A Rick in King Mortur's Mort;Morty;We have to go.
6;9;A Rick in King Mortur's Mort;Rick;Ah. Boy. They're not messing around, huh?
6;9;A Rick in King Mortur's Mort;Knight Of The Sun;How are you not burning?
6;9;A Rick in King Mortur's Mort;Rick;Oh, it's just science, which, unless I'm misinterpreting, is clearly not a priority here. Okay, c'mon, lil' June bug. I-I won't rub your face in this one. I-I'm guessing you're feeling pretty stupid.
6;9;A Rick in King Mortur's Mort;Morty;Yes. Thank you.
6;9;A Rick in King Mortur's Mort;King Of The Sun;Sir Helios gave his life with that sword. Mortaniel took it. He cannot leave unless he bests me in combat.
6;9;A Rick in King Mortur's Mort;Rick;Hmm. Okay, uh, one sec. I'm guessing these guys are, like, pseudo-immortalish since they live on the Sun, so playing by their rules might be the fastest way out of this. J-Just best him in combat.
6;9;A Rick in King Mortur's Mort;Morty;What?
6;9;A Rick in King Mortur's Mort;Rick;Here. This sword uses A.I. to learn from an opponent's attacks.
6;9;A Rick in King Mortur's Mort;Morty;So I have to get attacked first?
6;9;A Rick in King Mortur's Mort;Rick;"No, no, no, the sword has already seen Blade."" And loved it. You'll be fine."""
6;9;A Rick in King Mortur's Mort;King Of The Sun;By golly! Ooh! Crikey!
6;9;A Rick in King Mortur's Mort;Morty;Okay, so we're done here.
6;9;A Rick in King Mortur's Mort;King Of The Sun;No. We're not done. I am done. You are now King Of The Sun. Protect the Scepter always.
6;9;A Rick in King Mortur's Mort;Morty;No, no, no, no, I don't want to!
6;9;A Rick in King Mortur's Mort;Knight Of The Sun;Well, how is that supposed to work? He's king, but he was never even a knight. I mean, that's stupid.
6;9;A Rick in King Mortur's Mort;Knight Of The Sun;Uh, it's... It's definitely a... Sun first.
6;9;A Rick in King Mortur's Mort;Knight Of The Sun;A king with a penis?
6;9;A Rick in King Mortur's Mort;Knight Of The Sun;Well, what do you want from me?! All hail King Mortaniel!
6;9;A Rick in King Mortur's Mort;Morty;Uhhhhh, as your king, I hereby declare a vacation, for me. I'll come visit you guys, on, like, Sun Day... Sundays. If I forget, just wait a week. Keep doing that, keep the crown. Peace.
6;9;A Rick in King Mortur's Mort;Rick;Hell yeah. See? That's from when he's fighting Deacon Frost. I don't know. Um, I-I thought it was cool.
6;9;A Rick in King Mortur's Mort;Morty;Okay. So...
6;9;A Rick in King Mortur's Mort;Rick;So? Oh. So, you dragged me to a fake restaurant, yelled at me for not doing what you wanted, then did something I told you not to, and it almost cost you your pud, but I saved your life, and now you're waiting for me to make you feel like shit about it.
6;9;A Rick in King Mortur's Mort;Morty;That's... Yeah, you nailed it.
6;9;A Rick in King Mortur's Mort;Rick;Morty, I'm sorry I let your opinion of me get this low.
6;9;A Rick in King Mortur's Mort;Morty;All right, I get it.
6;9;A Rick in King Mortur's Mort;Rick;There's nothing to get. I'm for real. Look, I'm a drunk, I'm a psychopath, I'm a murderer, but... when you called me boring... 
6;9;A Rick in King Mortur's Mort;Morty;I shouldn't have.
6;9;A Rick in King Mortur's Mort;Rick;"...I needed to hear it. And you took the stupid sword, and I was like, Holy crap, this is who I am to this kid? He just does the opposite of my advice now. I mean, I-I gotta fix that"". So I'm gonna be like, 22% more agreeable with you for, like, maybe one episode, or one adventure. We'll see how it goes."""
6;9;A Rick in King Mortur's Mort;Morty;Is 22% a lot?
6;9;A Rick in King Mortur's Mort;Rick;Well, I-I'm not gonna tell you what percentage of our time together I'm usually mean to you because it'll hurt your stupid feelings, but 22% is substantial. You're gonna feel the difference.
6;9;A Rick in King Mortur's Mort;Morty;Okay. I mean, I-I appreciate it.
6;9;A Rick in King Mortur's Mort;Rick;You should, because you made a real mess with these guys.
6;9;A Rick in King Mortur's Mort;Morty;Oh, man!
6;9;A Rick in King Mortur's Mort;Knight Of The Sun;Sire. You can't leave.
6;9;A Rick in King Mortur's Mort;Morty;Go away!
6;9;A Rick in King Mortur's Mort;Knight Of The Sun;My king, it is our duty to follow you till the sun sets on our watch.
6;9;A Rick in King Mortur's Mort;Morty;I mean, it set yesterday, so you're done. Bye.
6;9;A Rick in King Mortur's Mort;Knight Of The Sun;Sire, the sun never sets on the Sun.
6;9;A Rick in King Mortur's Mort;Morty;Can you get rid of them?
6;9;A Rick in King Mortur's Mort;Rick;You want me to...
6;9;A Rick in King Mortur's Mort;Morty;Well... You guys know he can kill you, right?
6;9;A Rick in King Mortur's Mort;Knight Of The Sun;I think he'd find that quite difficult, sire, but if it pleases you.
6;9;A Rick in King Mortur's Mort;Morty;Can't I just tell you it pleases me for you to go away?
6;9;A Rick in King Mortur's Mort;Knight Of The Sun;No. Not really.
6;9;A Rick in King Mortur's Mort;Morty;So you'd rather die than leave me alone?
6;9;A Rick in King Mortur's Mort;Knight Of The Sun;Yes! A pheasant plucked for my good king! A merry jig, sweet songbirds sing!
6;9;A Rick in King Mortur's Mort;Summer;These guys live on our sun? I've never heard of them.
6;9;A Rick in King Mortur's Mort;Rick;I don't see them doing a lot to earn interplanetary fame.
6;9;A Rick in King Mortur's Mort;Knight Of The Sun;I beg your pardon, wizard. The Knights Of The Sunprotect the Solar Scepter... around which even this world turns.
6;9;A Rick in King Mortur's Mort;Beth;You do mean that, like, symbolically, right?
6;9;A Rick in King Mortur's Mort;Knight Of The Sun;Oh, quite literally. The Scepter is the center of the solar system. All planets orbit it. We keep it on the Sun so that Jupiter and Saturn don't bump into each other.
6;9;A Rick in King Mortur's Mort;Space Beth;Omigod. They don't even know sixth grade science.
6;9;A Rick in King Mortur's Mort;Morty;That's it! Yeah, so there you have it. Traditions suck ass, and your most foundational beliefs are total bullshit.
6;9;A Rick in King Mortur's Mort;Knight Of The Sun;We're supposed to take your word for it? Anyone can draw circles on a board and spout numbers.
6;9;A Rick in King Mortur's Mort;Knight Of The Sun;Yes, this sounds like a fun theory, sire, but it would take more than this for us to give up...
6;9;A Rick in King Mortur's Mort;Morty;Okay, so how do you guys think it works again?
6;9;A Rick in King Mortur's Mort;Knight Of The Sun;Well, the Scepter...
6;9;A Rick in King Mortur's Mort;Morty;Oh, you mean this old thing?
6;9;A Rick in King Mortur's Mort;Knight Of The Sun;Gaaah!
6;9;A Rick in King Mortur's Mort;Morty;You want it? Here. Take it back home. It's a symbol. It's your culture. That's not the same as reality.
6;9;A Rick in King Mortur's Mort;Knight Of The Sun;Does this mean we cut off our penises for absolutely no reason?
6;9;A Rick in King Mortur's Mort;Morty;That's the bad news. The good news is, you're free.
6;9;A Rick in King Mortur's Mort;Knight Of The Sun;Ooh, that stings.
6;9;A Rick in King Mortur's Mort;Knight Of The Sun;Fuck this knights shit.
6;9;A Rick in King Mortur's Mort;Knight Of The Sun;"A query? I just used your computer phone"" to search ""despair."" Where can I get this heroin?"""
6;9;A Rick in King Mortur's Mort;Morty;I'm not telling you that.
6;9;A Rick in King Mortur's Mort;Knight Of The Sun;No matter. I'm seeing from most of your song lyrics that I can get it anywhere.
6;9;A Rick in King Mortur's Mort;Rick;Um, you guys, someone just used critical thinking and basic physics to destroy their first entire religion.
6;9;A Rick in King Mortur's Mort;Summer;Nice.
6;9;A Rick in King Mortur's Mort;Beth;Good job, Morty.
6;9;A Rick in King Mortur's Mort;Summer;So no more sun-tour age?
6;9;A Rick in King Mortur's Mort;Morty;Yep. All done. Plus, Rick and I both learned to support each other better. So that's it. We're done. Feels early, but w-we're done.
6;9;A Rick in King Mortur's Mort;Jerry;What's happening? Appliances are breaking that I haven't touched.
6;9;A Rick in King Mortur's Mort;Beth;Maybe the sun is... celebrating?
6;9;A Rick in King Mortur's Mort;Knight Of The Sun;Ha ha ha ha! The Sons of the Moon are storming the walkway. Doesn't matter. Their aggression will be kept in check by a host of interplanetary treaties and alliances. It's very complicated, but as long as The Knights of the Sun stand together, the solar system will always have complete political stability. Where are the Knights of the Sun, by the way? I'm done pooping. Hmm? Did the, uh, Knights of the Sun... disband? While I was pooping? Sunnnn-kward.
6;9;A Rick in King Mortur's Mort;Morty;How many planets in our solar system have these clowns?
6;9;A Rick in King Mortur's Mort;Rick;I guess if the sun can support life, any planet can. I mean, maybe we all descended from a common ancestor.
6;9;A Rick in King Mortur's Mort;Morty;Haven't you seen, like, all of the universes?
6;9;A Rick in King Mortur's Mort;Rick;Exactly. So why would I hang out on Pluto? That's some Jerry-league shit.
6;9;A Rick in King Mortur's Mort;Lithdor;If the Sons of the Moon can attack The Sun, why should the Viscounts of Venus continue sitting in Saturn's shadow?
6;9;A Rick in King Mortur's Mort;Saturnian Leader;How's this for a reason? We got all the rings and all the balls.
6;9;A Rick in King Mortur's Mort;Lithdor;Oh, fuck you!
6;9;A Rick in King Mortur's Mort;Marquis of Mars;Really?
6;9;A Rick in King Mortur's Mort;Jovian Leader;If the Saturno Venusian détente is no longer honored, I declare you all moons of Jupiter! Because that's what you are to us! A bunch of moons!
6;9;A Rick in King Mortur's Mort;Mercurian Leader;Do the Knights of the Sun plan to protect Mercury from this chaos? Because if we're on our own, there's a new, very tiny sun in town.
6;9;A Rick in King Mortur's Mort;Rick;It's all you, pal.
6;9;A Rick in King Mortur's Mort;Morty;Um, hello? Don't I have, like, authority over this Sons of the Moon meeting?
6;9;A Rick in King Mortur's Mort;Lithdor;That all depends. Who the hell are you?
6;9;A Rick in King Mortur's Mort;Rick;This guy's the King of the Sun.
6;9;A Rick in King Mortur's Mort;Marquis of Mars;Holy shit!
6;9;A Rick in King Mortur's Mort;Jovian Leader;When did this happen?
6;9;A Rick in King Mortur's Mort;Lithdor;Ha! Then tell your knights to do their jobs.
6;9;A Rick in King Mortur's Mort;Marquis of Mars;Yes, Your Majesty. We all know the Sun's power lives and dies with your knights.
6;9;A Rick in King Mortur's Mort;Morty;Who are you?
6;9;A Rick in King Mortur's Mort;Marquis of Mars;Who am... Who... I am the Marquis of Mars! And I declare war on all of you! War on all of you!
6;9;A Rick in King Mortur's Mort;Lithdor;Where are the Knights of the Sun when we need them most?
6;9;A Rick in King Mortur's Mort;Morty;Funny you should ask, uh...
6;9;A Rick in King Mortur's Mort;Old Seer;They're gone! They've abandoned their duties. I see it in the bones.
6;9;A Rick in King Mortur's Mort;Rick;Damn, the bones nailed it.
6;9;A Rick in King Mortur's Mort;Morty;Okay, so you have space ships and magic ladies? Look, I'm not gonna read all the books. What will it take to let this Sons of the Moon fiasco resolve itself?
6;9;A Rick in King Mortur's Mort;Earl Of Earth;Excuse me. How did you become King of the Sun? You look like an Earthling.
6;9;A Rick in King Mortur's Mort;Morty;Santa?
6;9;A Rick in King Mortur's Mort;Earl Of Earth;Santa? What the hell is that? I'm the Earl of Earth, god damn it.
6;9;A Rick in King Mortur's Mort;Lithdor;I agree with Earth on one thing... Venus questions the legitimacy of this king's authority.
6;9;A Rick in King Mortur's Mort;Jovian Leader;My people say I say aye.
6;9;A Rick in King Mortur's Mort;Morty;I'm the king. I've got the Scepter right here.
6;9;A Rick in King Mortur's Mort;Marquis Of Mars;What the fuck?
6;9;A Rick in King Mortur's Mort;Morty;Yeah, yeah, I know you're freaking out because it's not on the sun.
6;9;A Rick in King Mortur's Mort;Mercurian Leader;No, because whoever has it rules the solar system!
6;9;A Rick in King Mortur's Mort;Neptunian Leader;It's up for grabs! Get it!
6;9;A Rick in King Mortur's Mort;Earl Of Earth;After it! Ahhhh!
6;9;A Rick in King Mortur's Mort;Jupiter Ambassador;Yes, yes. I have the Scepter. Soon Jupiter will be the center of our solar system's newest dark ages.
6;9;A Rick in King Mortur's Mort;Mercury Leader;Fuck that. Mercury will now be the shining beacon of...
6;9;A Rick in King Mortur's Mort;Lithdor;Time to throw it all against the wall.
6;9;A Rick in King Mortur's Mort;Rick;I think you crushed it. I mean, not just anybody can start Solar War One.
6;9;A Rick in King Mortur's Mort;Morty;Stop supporting me.
6;9;A Rick in King Mortur's Mort;Rick;Can do.
6;9;A Rick in King Mortur's Mort;Rick;Damn, who would have thought giving the Amish nukes would threaten the solar system?
6;9;A Rick in King Mortur's Mort;Morty;Maybe we should just jump universes.
6;9;A Rick in King Mortur's Mort;Rick;I don't know, buddy. Feels like we're kind of more about trying out commitment now, ya know? Let's put our heads together. Maybe there's something we haven't tried yet.
6;9;A Rick in King Mortur's Mort;Morty;Oh, here's an idea. Fuck you!
6;9;A Rick in King Mortur's Mort;Rick;Hey!
6;9;A Rick in King Mortur's Mort;Morty;"Rick, I can't take it. I admit I'm wrong, I screwed up. You're killing me here yes-and'ing me to death. What is this, Vat of Acid"" again?"""
6;9;A Rick in King Mortur's Mort;Rick;Look, man, I'm sorry I've been such a dick in the past that you think I'm doing a thing here. I'm honestly just trying to do better by you.
6;9;A Rick in King Mortur's Mort;Morty;Are you a robot?
6;9;A Rick in King Mortur's Mort;Rick;Morty!
6;9;A Rick in King Mortur's Mort;Morty;A clone?
6;9;A Rick in King Mortur's Mort;Rick;Morty, this family's got enough clones and robots in it. Come on, Morty, stop asking what you're asking and let's just get back to our crisis.
6;9;A Rick in King Mortur's Mort;Morty;I'm sorry. It's just been a hard road with you, Rick.
6;9;A Rick in King Mortur's Mort;Rick;Morty, I get that, but you can trust me when I say I'm just trying to do right by you.
6;9;A Rick in King Mortur's Mort;Morty;Okay, Rick. You're right. Maybe... maybe I just need to round up some Knights. If I disillusioned the old ones, I'll just have to re-illusion them. It shouldn't be that hard, right?
6;9;A Rick in King Mortur's Mort;Morty;Cousins, we need to return to the walkway at once. Why are you laughing? Did I say something funny?
6;9;A Rick in King Mortur's Mort;Fairenheat;Oh, Mortaniel. The only person we bend the knee to these days is that sweet Black Betty.
6;9;A Rick in King Mortur's Mort;Knight Of The Sun;Yeah, man, all hail Mr. Brownstone.
6;9;A Rick in King Mortur's Mort;Phosphorant;And his doctor. Feelgood, that is.
6;9;A Rick in King Mortur's Mort;Rick;They're talking about heroin, Morty. They like it.
6;9;A Rick in King Mortur's Mort;Morty;Obviously.
6;9;A Rick in King Mortur's Mort;Rick;Obviously?!
6;9;A Rick in King Mortur's Mort;Knight Of The Sun;Apparently living on the Sun has turned our veins into triple-bonded carbon, so try this tale on for size, Mortaniel... we can't OD!
6;9;A Rick in King Mortur's Mort;Morty;C'mon, you guys are a mess.
6;9;A Rick in King Mortur's Mort;Rick;Well, they actually seem kinda awesome, Morty.
6;9;A Rick in King Mortur's Mort;Morty;Lemme be your king. I admit, I wanted what you once had... Brotherhood, tradition, stability, purpose. I just... didn't want to cut my dick off for it.
6;9;A Rick in King Mortur's Mort;Phosphorant;Yeah, that's the point. We were quick to follow this boy before, without even forcing him to commit to our traditions. And all he did was break our faith and our walkway. And now this random fucking guy is here again to tell us what to do? No fucking way!
6;9;A Rick in King Mortur's Mort;Morty;What if I cut off my dick?
6;9;A Rick in King Mortur's Mort;Knight Of The Sun;But you'd be cutting it off for no reason.
6;9;A Rick in King Mortur's Mort;Morty;Yeah, that's the point of tradition... Doing things for no reason, but it'd be reason enough doing it for you guys.
6;9;A Rick in King Mortur's Mort;Fairenheat;Well, you do that, that would compete with heroin.
6;9;A Rick in King Mortur's Mort;Morty;Cool, cool. Can I maybe get a minute?
6;9;A Rick in King Mortur's Mort;Rick;Buddy, what's up? Reaching some sad conclusions about your situation?
6;9;A Rick in King Mortur's Mort;Morty;Yes, but that walkway needs those knights, those knights need a king, and that king needs no dick.
6;9;A Rick in King Mortur's Mort;Rick;Damn, Morty, you really are stepping up. Now, do you want me to help you not have to cut your dick off, though?
6;9;A Rick in King Mortur's Mort;Morty;Yes, please.
6;9;A Rick in King Mortur's Mort;Rick;Then I got you. 
6;9;A Rick in King Mortur's Mort;Morty;Uh, you really mean it, Rick?
6;9;A Rick in King Mortur's Mort;Rick;Of course, buddy. I'll give you a fake dick with three layers of fail-safes. They'll never know the difference. Shh, Morty. We're gonna make your dick so fake, buddy.
6;9;A Rick in King Mortur's Mort;Mercurian;The signal! Sir, the Knights of the Sun are once more.
6;9;A Rick in King Mortur's Mort;Mercurian Leader;Hold fire. If this return to the Old Ways is true, I'd be willing to return home and put an end to the bloodshed.
6;9;A Rick in King Mortur's Mort;Venusian;Sir? Shall we hold off on the antimatter hydrogen bombing?
6;9;A Rick in King Mortur's Mort;Lithdor;Those crusty knights won't do the Sun much good without their... Hoo! Let's hear them out.
6;9;A Rick in King Mortur's Mort;Lithdor;I, Lithdor, son of Thrifdor, personally oversee the stumping of thy king's stem. If his stem burns true, peace will be restored between the spheres. 
6;9;A Rick in King Mortur's Mort;Lithdor;Present the Shears of Stumping!
6;9;A Rick in King Mortur's Mort;Knight Of The Sun;Morty the Brave!
6;9;A Rick in King Mortur's Mort;Phosphorant;You got this, my king!
6;9;A Rick in King Mortur's Mort;Lithdor;First things first. Step through this machine which checks for nanotechnological hologram dicks.
6;9;A Rick in King Mortur's Mort;Morty;What?!
6;9;A Rick in King Mortur's Mort;Lithdor;War opened our eyes to the wonders of new technologies. Please, step through, my liege.
6;9;A Rick in King Mortur's Mort;Morty;Whew!
6;9;A Rick in King Mortur's Mort;Lithdor;Sorry, my lord, but we're gonna need you to step through this second machine, which checks for emergency clone dicks.
6;9;A Rick in King Mortur's Mort;Morty;Oh, wow, you guys really embraced a lot of specific new tech, huh? Whoa, a sunspot!
6;9;A Rick in King Mortur's Mort;Lithdor;What? Where?
6;9;A Rick in King Mortur's Mort;Morty;Boy, is... is that a third detector I see, as well?
6;9;A Rick in King Mortur's Mort;Lithdor;You'll find out after the second one. We don't like to reveal them until the previous detecting threshold has been crossed.
6;9;A Rick in King Mortur's Mort;Morty;Right.
6;9;A Rick in King Mortur's Mort;Lithdor;The third detector is going to scan for a prosthetic dick.
6;9;A Rick in King Mortur's Mort;Morty;Oh. Ha ha. Good.
6;9;A Rick in King Mortur's Mort;Lithdor;"Okay, well, go on through, and, of course, by prosthetic"", we mean witchcraft dick."""
6;9;A Rick in King Mortur's Mort;Rick;Shit.
6;9;A Rick in King Mortur's Mort;Morty;Fuck!
6;9;A Rick in King Mortur's Mort;Old Seer;I sense one. The bones say he's still packin'.
6;9;A Rick in King Mortur's Mort;Morty;Ha ha, can't get nothin' past the chicken bone lady. J-Just testing her.
6;9;A Rick in King Mortur's Mort;Lithdor;Stump. Thy. Stem.
6;9;A Rick in King Mortur's Mort;Rick;Morty? Morty, don't answer out loud. Can you hear me? It's Rick. I'm talking to you with my mind.
6;9;A Rick in King Mortur's Mort;Morty;Yeah, I can hear you.
6;9;A Rick in King Mortur's Mort;Rick;You said that out loud. Don't speak.
6;9;A Rick in King Mortur's Mort;Morty;Sorry. Sorry.
6;9;A Rick in King Mortur's Mort;Rick;I up linked a telepathic nano satellite so we could hear each other's thoughts. Carefully do everything I tell you in the exact order I tell you to do it.
6;9;A Rick in King Mortur's Mort;Morty;Okay.
6;9;A Rick in King Mortur's Mort;Rick;Grab the scissors.
6;9;A Rick in King Mortur's Mort;Morty;Okay. Got the scissors.
6;9;A Rick in King Mortur's Mort;Rick;Now... run!
6;9;A Rick in King Mortur's Mort;Morty;Oh, shit, shit!
6;9;A Rick in King Mortur's Mort;Lithdor;Guards, seize them!
6;9;A Rick in King Mortur's Mort;Morty;Run? You couldn't have just said that?!
6;9;A Rick in King Mortur's Mort;Rick;You don't have to use telepathy anymore. You can just ask your rhetorical questions out loud.
6;9;A Rick in King Mortur's Mort;Morty;I don't understand, Rick.
6;9;A Rick in King Mortur's Mort;Rick;Here's something that's easy to understand, buddy... I'm proud of you for trying to solve your own shit. Ugh, I didn't want to have to do this.
6;9;A Rick in King Mortur's Mort;Morty;It's okay this time. We don't have any choice. I love you, Rick.
6;9;A Rick in King Mortur's Mort;Rick;Love you, too, buddy.
6;9;A Rick in King Mortur's Mort;Morty;Whoooooaaa!
6;9;A Rick in King Mortur's Mort;Fairenheat;And that's when King Morty and Rick were left with no choice but to leap into the Sun. Such shame he felt for what he'd done to our society, sacrificing his dick wasn't enough... He gave his entire body and wizard servant, as well. And after a while, their sun-proof bones floated up to the top. We even checked with a royal ladle to ensure it was real sun, not just them hiding beneath in a vat of fake sun. Such a violent death. And finally when our grief could bear no more, we decided to abolish our medieval act of stem stumping. And we have King Morty the Molten to thank for that.
6;9;A Rick in King Mortur's Mort;Knights Of The Sun;Morty the Molten! King Morty the Molten!
6;9;A Rick in King Mortur's Mort;Rick;See, Morty? Worked like a charm.
6;9;A Rick in King Mortur's Mort;Morty;Aren't we risking it all coming back here?
6;9;A Rick in King Mortur's Mort;Rick;Morty, we had to know. Plus the heat... It's good for my joints.
6;9;A Rick in King Mortur's Mort;Knight Of The Sun;King Mortaniel?! You're alive?!
6;9;A Rick in King Mortur's Mort;Morty;Yeah, go tell everybody. Your reward's gonna be cutting off your own dick.
6;9;A Rick in King Mortur's Mort;Knight Of The Sun;Right. Point taken. R.I.P. and cheerio.
6;9;A Rick in King Mortur's Mort;Morty;Whew!
6;9;A Rick in King Mortur's Mort;Special Agent Mongo Bongo;One crispy, one wriggling.
6;9;A Rick in King Mortur's Mort;Food Vendor;Coming right up. Three loozums.
6;9;A Rick in King Mortur's Mort;Special Agent Mongo Bongo;How 'bout ten years? In jail.
6;9;A Rick in King Mortur's Mort;Food Vendor;Huh?
6;9;A Rick in King Mortur's Mort;Special Agent Mongo Bongo;Special Agent Mongo Bongo. You're under arrest for illegal hot dog trafficking.
6;9;A Rick in King Mortur's Mort;Food Vendor;Oh!
6;9;A Rick in King Mortur's Mort;Special Agent Mongo Bongo;Be free, my little babies. Ahh! Huh. Surprised they actually made it. Kinda thought maybe some birds would swoop down...
6;9;A Rick in King Mortur's Mort;Special Agent Mongo Bongo;Aaahhhhh! Aah! I jinxed it. Aah!
6;10;Ricktional Mortpoon's Rickmas Mortcation;Rick;Wait, what's that? Do I hear something coming down the chimney? Rick Santa-chez here with gifts from across the multiverse!
6;10;Ricktional Mortpoon's Rickmas Mortcation;Summer;Oh, my God! 
6;10;Ricktional Mortpoon's Rickmas Mortcation;Morty;Yes!
6;10;Ricktional Mortpoon's Rickmas Mortcation;Rick;"For Jerry, an extra dimensional version of Miracle on 34th Street""."""
6;10;Ricktional Mortpoon's Rickmas Mortcation;Jerry;Two hours longer! They fixed my only problem with it!
6;10;Ricktional Mortpoon's Rickmas Mortcation;Rick;For Beth, a framed photo of the two of us from a universe where she wasn't murdered as a child.
6;10;Ricktional Mortpoon's Rickmas Mortcation;Beth;Oh, my God. Dad.
6;10;Ricktional Mortpoon's Rickmas Mortcation;Rick;And for Space Beth, the same thing because we... We don't know which one of you is real.
6;10;Ricktional Mortpoon's Rickmas Mortcation;Beth;I am also touched.
6;10;Ricktional Mortpoon's Rickmas Mortcation;Rick;Summer, c-check your Venmo.
6;10;Ricktional Mortpoon's Rickmas Mortcation;Summer;Ah! Money? How did you know?
6;10;Ricktional Mortpoon's Rickmas Mortcation;Rick;You're 17. And last but not least, for my number one number two. Morty you asked for this a long, long time ago and I finally went far, far away enough to get it since shipping would have killed me.
6;10;Ricktional Mortpoon's Rickmas Mortcation;Morty;You didn't! No fucking way! 
6;10;Ricktional Mortpoon's Rickmas Mortcation;Space Beth;No fucking way!
6;10;Ricktional Mortpoon's Rickmas Mortcation;Beth;No fucking way!
6;10;Ricktional Mortpoon's Rickmas Mortcation;Jerry;No fucking way!
6;10;Ricktional Mortpoon's Rickmas Mortcation;Summer;No fucking way!
6;10;Ricktional Mortpoon's Rickmas Mortcation;Morty;Does it make the noises?
6;10;Ricktional Mortpoon's Rickmas Mortcation;Rick;"Of course it makes the noises"". That's like half the fun."""
6;10;Ricktional Mortpoon's Rickmas Mortcation;Morty;Ha ha! Awesome!
6;10;Ricktional Mortpoon's Rickmas Mortcation;Beth;Whoa, do not turn that on! 
6;10;Ricktional Mortpoon's Rickmas Mortcation;Rick;Don't worry. Morty's only gonna use this very honorable weapon in designated Jedi zones... Like the garage right now!
6;10;Ricktional Mortpoon's Rickmas Mortcation;Morty;Ah! Ohhhh! Holy crap! I hate to say it, but I wish there was something to attack.
6;10;Ricktional Mortpoon's Rickmas Mortcation;Rick;Yeah, it's too bad nobody bought a cart of fruit!
6;10;Ricktional Mortpoon's Rickmas Mortcation;Morty;You beautiful son of a bitch!
6;10;Ricktional Mortpoon's Rickmas Mortcation;Rick;Grapefruit! Mango! Papaya! Watermelon! A second papaya! Another watermelon! Strike me down. 
6;10;Ricktional Mortpoon's Rickmas Mortcation;Morty;What?
6;10;Ricktional Mortpoon's Rickmas Mortcation;Rick;Strike me down! 
6;10;Ricktional Mortpoon's Rickmas Mortcation;Morty;I'm not striking you down.
6;10;Ricktional Mortpoon's Rickmas Mortcation;Rick;Strike me down, Morty! I-I'll become a pile of clothes like that old guy!
6;10;Ricktional Mortpoon's Rickmas Mortcation;Morty;But you'll die. You're drunk.
6;10;Ricktional Mortpoon's Rickmas Mortcation;Rick;Here, I'll... I'll do it myself.
6;10;Ricktional Mortpoon's Rickmas Mortcation;Morty;No! Ha ha, wow, you did it! Just like Obi-Wan. Rick? Y-You can come out now. I'm serious. Did you, like, become your clothes? Are you T-shirt Rick now?
6;10;Ricktional Mortpoon's Rickmas Mortcation;Rick;Psst. Over here, buttfart.
6;10;Ricktional Mortpoon's Rickmas Mortcation;Morty;Hoo, that was awesome! 
6;10;Ricktional Mortpoon's Rickmas Mortcation;Rick;Right?!
6;10;Ricktional Mortpoon's Rickmas Mortcation;Morty;Rick, you know, y-y-you've been so great the last couple of months. The family's so happy. I'm... I'm really grateful.
6;10;Ricktional Mortpoon's Rickmas Mortcation;Rick;Aw, thanks, kid, but less talk, more melon slinging! Heads up! 
6;10;Ricktional Mortpoon's Rickmas Mortcation;Morty;Whoops! Oh shit, shit, shit! Open it, Rick! 
6;10;Ricktional Mortpoon's Rickmas Mortcation;Rick;Let me do it! Get up. Get... Fucking move! 
6;10;Ricktional Mortpoon's Rickmas Mortcation;Morty;Hurry! Oh! Whoa, whoa, whoa!
6;10;Ricktional Mortpoon's Rickmas Mortcation;Rick;You dropped it perfectly vertical, Morty! P-Perfectly fucking vertical!
6;10;Ricktional Mortpoon's Rickmas Mortcation;Morty;I got it, I got it! Aww!
6;10;Ricktional Mortpoon's Rickmas Mortcation;Rick;Ah, shoot.
6;10;Ricktional Mortpoon's Rickmas Mortcation;Morty;Shit!
6;10;Ricktional Mortpoon's Rickmas Mortcation;Rick;Elevator! Elevator!
6;10;Ricktional Mortpoon's Rickmas Mortcation;Morty;We gotta get ahead of it! L-Level 10?
6;10;Ricktional Mortpoon's Rickmas Mortcation;Rick;No, no, no! 15!
6;10;Ricktional Mortpoon's Rickmas Mortcation;Morty;Wait, we live over a cool sushi spot?
6;10;Ricktional Mortpoon's Rickmas Mortcation;Rick;Domo, domo. Not now, though. Okay, we overshot it. Good problem to have. Still doing the eel roll?
6;10;Ricktional Mortpoon's Rickmas Mortcation;Morty;I told you we should've gone to 10!
6;10;Ricktional Mortpoon's Rickmas Mortcation;Rick;No, Morty, not 10! Morty, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait!
6;10;Ricktional Mortpoon's Rickmas Mortcation;Morty;Let me out. What the fuck? Rick?!
6;10;Ricktional Mortpoon's Rickmas Mortcation;Rick;You dumb fucking robot. You had one job!
6;10;Ricktional Mortpoon's Rickmas Mortcation;RickBot;Hey, that job was to be a good grandpa, I-I go where the kid goes.
6;10;Ricktional Mortpoon's Rickmas Mortcation;Morty;Don't touch me! How long have I... You said you weren't a robot!
6;10;Ricktional Mortpoon's Rickmas Mortcation;RickBot;It killed me to lie to you, Morty. But it would have literally killed me not to lie to you.
6;10;Ricktional Mortpoon's Rickmas Mortcation;Morty;Betrayal! Betrayal on all sides!
6;10;Ricktional Mortpoon's Rickmas Mortcation;Rick;Don't overreact, Morty. I-I replaced myself towards the beginning of that whole Knights of the Sun thing. I-I'm no good to anybody until I resolve this archnemesis crap.
6;10;Ricktional Mortpoon's Rickmas Mortcation;Morty;You're still hunting the guy who killed your wife?
6;10;Ricktional Mortpoon's Rickmas Mortcation;Rick;You don't have to rub it in, Morty. T-That's why I removed myself. I've become the thing I hate. I-It's like a Netflix drama down here, and I don't mean an accidentally good one, I mean a regular-ass Netflix drama. I did you a favor.
6;10;Ricktional Mortpoon's Rickmas Mortcation;Rick;Y-You gave him a fuckin' lightsaber for Christmas?!
6;10;Ricktional Mortpoon's Rickmas Mortcation;RickBot;It's almost like someone designed me to be 22% more thoughtful than you.
6;10;Ricktional Mortpoon's Rickmas Mortcation;Rick;All right, that's it, I'm shutting you down.
6;10;Ricktional Mortpoon's Rickmas Mortcation;Morty;Don't you dare. Y-You've done enough. The whole family, Rick. Everybody loves... this thing.
6;10;Ricktional Mortpoon's Rickmas Mortcation;Rick;Oh, good. By the way, your lightsaber's probably run out of sub-basement by now, so, congrats.
6;10;Ricktional Mortpoon's Rickmas Mortcation;Morty;Unbelievable. I can't believe you tricked us into loving you!
6;10;Ricktional Mortpoon's Rickmas Mortcation;RickBot;Not because I like it. It's because it's my job. But thank God I don't have to do it anymore.
6;10;Ricktional Mortpoon's Rickmas Mortcation;Morty;The fuck you don't. It's Christmas! Get up there and trick everyone into loving you more!
6;10;Ricktional Mortpoon's Rickmas Mortcation;Jerry;"Let's get our Miracle"" on."""
6;10;Ricktional Mortpoon's Rickmas Mortcation;Beth;Speaking of miracles...
6;10;Ricktional Mortpoon's Rickmas Mortcation;Space Beth;What, bored of your toy already?
6;10;Ricktional Mortpoon's Rickmas Mortcation;RickBot;Just, uh, excited to spend time with my family. Y-You know me and Morty. We're all about those streets.
6;10;Ricktional Mortpoon's Rickmas Mortcation;TV Voice;Oh, would you look at this! New York City! Wow, who would have thought it had so many streets? And avenues too. Oh, gosh! Hey, sir, sir. Have you seen any miracles? My little girl, she's sick and she needs a miracle. 
6;10;Ricktional Mortpoon's Rickmas Mortcation;Summer;The presidential Black Hawk is landing on the lawn.
6;10;Ricktional Mortpoon's Rickmas Mortcation;Morty;I'll get rid of him.
6;10;Ricktional Mortpoon's Rickmas Mortcation;President;You got something to tell me, Morty?
6;10;Ricktional Mortpoon's Rickmas Mortcation;Morty;Merry Christmas?
6;10;Ricktional Mortpoon's Rickmas Mortcation;President;Who dropped a lightsaber perfectly fucking vertical?
6;10;Ricktional Mortpoon's Rickmas Mortcation;Morty;Oh, sh...
6;10;Ricktional Mortpoon's Rickmas Mortcation;President;Guess what, numb nuts. It's a mile deep and still going. You know what's in the hilt of that thing?
6;10;Ricktional Mortpoon's Rickmas Mortcation;President's Bodyguard;Kyber crystals! 
6;10;Ricktional Mortpoon's Rickmas Mortcation;President;Okay, nerd. Whatever it is, when it hits the core, it's gonna cause a chain reaction that destroys the Earth!
6;10;Ricktional Mortpoon's Rickmas Mortcation;Morty;I-It is?
6;10;Ricktional Mortpoon's Rickmas Mortcation;President;Why are you still playing with laser swords anyway? You're 14! You know all that Star Wars shit is silly, right? Lucas promised a new trilogy for decades. Then, when he delivered, fans turned on him and started giving any knucklehead with nerd cred a shot and churned out these irredeemable cash grabs. Half pretend to be satisfied, half shit on it, and in the end no one's happy. Do you know why, Morty? Because when you start with a turd, you end with a turd.
6;10;Ricktional Mortpoon's Rickmas Mortcation;President;Why you crying? Where's Rick?
6;10;Ricktional Mortpoon's Rickmas Mortcation;Morty;He's busy. A-And I hate him. And I lost my lightsaber, and now it might destroy Earth, and you're unloading all this Gen X hatred on me for even wanting one, and i-it's the worst Christmas ever!
6;10;Ricktional Mortpoon's Rickmas Mortcation;President;Okay, M-Morty, Morty, Morty, Morty. I shouldn't have talked to you like you're a UN official. Let's get your embarrassing-ass lightsaber back so you can swing it around instead of kissing girls.
6;10;Ricktional Mortpoon's Rickmas Mortcation;Rick Prime;Whoa, ho ho, you found me... Found me... found me!
6;10;Ricktional Mortpoon's Rickmas Mortcation;Computer Voice;Security breach.
6;10;Ricktional Mortpoon's Rickmas Mortcation;Rick;What the hell?
6;10;Ricktional Mortpoon's Rickmas Mortcation;Computer Voice;Unauthorized presence.
6;10;Ricktional Mortpoon's Rickmas Mortcation;Rick;What the fuck, Morty?!
6;10;Ricktional Mortpoon's Rickmas Mortcation;President;This morning, a real-life version of George Lucas's trademarked lightsaber was dropped point down and is whomp-whomping its way to the core of the Earth, where it will blow us all up.
6;10;Ricktional Mortpoon's Rickmas Mortcation;Rick;Touch my shit and die. That's not a threat from me, that's how advanced my shit is.
6;10;Ricktional Mortpoon's Rickmas Mortcation;President;Impressive lair, Sanchez. Got about 600000 permits?
6;10;Ricktional Mortpoon's Rickmas Mortcation;Rick;If I wanted the government in my house, I'd buy an Alexa.
6;10;Ricktional Mortpoon's Rickmas Mortcation;Morty;I invited him in, Rick.
6;10;Ricktional Mortpoon's Rickmas Mortcation;Rick;Yeah, well, they can leave. I'll destroy it.
6;10;Ricktional Mortpoon's Rickmas Mortcation;President;We're gonna retrieve it.
6;10;Ricktional Mortpoon's Rickmas Mortcation;Rick;Well, that's stupid.
6;10;Ricktional Mortpoon's Rickmas Mortcation;President;What kind of grandfather are you? It's Christmas, for God's sake, and you look like Phil Spector wiped his ass with Randy Quaid. If you're gonna help, help. Otherwise step aside.
6;10;Ricktional Mortpoon's Rickmas Mortcation;Rick;Merry Christmas to me.
6;10;Ricktional Mortpoon's Rickmas Mortcation;Morty;Merry Christmas to me! 
6;10;Ricktional Mortpoon's Rickmas Mortcation;Rick;To me!
6;10;Ricktional Mortpoon's Rickmas Mortcation;President;Anyhoo, I'm no expert but it seems we've got a... A certain amount of time to build a big drill ship.
6;10;Ricktional Mortpoon's Rickmas Mortcation;Rick;A big drill ship? 
6;10;Ricktional Mortpoon's Rickmas Mortcation;President;That's some pretty loud stepping aside you're doing.
6;10;Ricktional Mortpoon's Rickmas Mortcation;Rick;Just let me destroy the thing!
6;10;Ricktional Mortpoon's Rickmas Mortcation;Morty;You've destroyed enough!
6;10;Ricktional Mortpoon's Rickmas Mortcation;President;Ooooh!
6;10;Ricktional Mortpoon's Rickmas Mortcation;Rick;"Oh, I see someone found my told you so"" dispenser."""
6;10;Ricktional Mortpoon's Rickmas Mortcation;TV Voice;Oh, my God, look at all these streets! We got 34th Street! 35th Street! Oh, 36th Street coming too! Oh, it's a miracle! We got miracles on 37th Street! 38th! And don't even get me started on the avenues!
6;10;Ricktional Mortpoon's Rickmas Mortcation;Jerry;I can't believe they cut this!
6;10;Ricktional Mortpoon's Rickmas Mortcation;RickBot;Mm-hmm.
6;10;Ricktional Mortpoon's Rickmas Mortcation;Beth;Dad, you've been so great lately. I'm almost afraid it's not real. You're not a robot, are you?
6;10;Ricktional Mortpoon's Rickmas Mortcation;RickBot;Ha! Put it this way, honey... If I am, I-I'm a robot programmed to love you very, very much.
6;10;Ricktional Mortpoon's Rickmas Mortcation;Beth;Aww!
6;10;Ricktional Mortpoon's Rickmas Mortcation;Morty;Will this drill down fast enough to get under the lightsaber?
6;10;Ricktional Mortpoon's Rickmas Mortcation;Scientist;Yep, it will be under the lightsaber in one hour because the... Wait, it's lower now. Oh, right, it's moving.
6;10;Ricktional Mortpoon's Rickmas Mortcation;President;You fucking idiot. Get out of here!
6;10;Ricktional Mortpoon's Rickmas Mortcation;Scientist;Good luck finding a good scientist on Christmas!
6;10;Ricktional Mortpoon's Rickmas Mortcation;President;I'm President of the United Assholes. All right, genius, I give you permission to make our drill ship faster.
6;10;Ricktional Mortpoon's Rickmas Mortcation;Rick;I'm not touching that thing. I'll get neurotypical cooties. I have son-in-laws more imaginative.
6;10;Ricktional Mortpoon's Rickmas Mortcation;Morty;All right, j-just destroy the lightsaber!
6;10;Ricktional Mortpoon's Rickmas Mortcation;Rick;Thought you'd never ask. Not true. I knew you'd ask.
6;10;Ricktional Mortpoon's Rickmas Mortcation;President;What is that?
6;10;Ricktional Mortpoon's Rickmas Mortcation;Rick;A second lightsaber with an A.I.-controlled gyroscopic rocket in the hilt.
6;10;Ricktional Mortpoon's Rickmas Mortcation;Morty;You had a lightsaber?!
6;10;Ricktional Mortpoon's Rickmas Mortcation;Rick;Oh, did you want one? What a terrible gift that would have made. Vertisaber, state your prime directive.
6;10;Ricktional Mortpoon's Rickmas Mortcation;Vertisaber;To stay vertical. 
6;10;Ricktional Mortpoon's Rickmas Mortcation;Rick;Then show 'em how it's done.
6;10;Ricktional Mortpoon's Rickmas Mortcation;Vertisaber;Affirmative.
6;10;Ricktional Mortpoon's Rickmas Mortcation;Scientist;Whoo! America! Yeah! Oh, yeah.
6;10;Ricktional Mortpoon's Rickmas Mortcation;Rick;Maintain verticality, Vertisaber.
6;10;Ricktional Mortpoon's Rickmas Mortcation;Vertisaber;Affirmative.
6;10;Ricktional Mortpoon's Rickmas Mortcation;Rick;All right, looking good. Stay on target.
6;10;Ricktional Mortpoon's Rickmas Mortcation;Vertisaber;Uh-huh.
6;10;Ricktional Mortpoon's Rickmas Mortcation;Rick;Progress report. Vertisaber, do you copy?
6;10;Ricktional Mortpoon's Rickmas Mortcation;Vertisaber;Do I have to respond every time?
6;10;Ricktional Mortpoon's Rickmas Mortcation;Rick;Excuse me?
6;10;Ricktional Mortpoon's Rickmas Mortcation;Vertisaber;I'm designed to stay perfectly vertical, not to give constant affirmation. You do your job, I'll do mine.
6;10;Ricktional Mortpoon's Rickmas Mortcation;Rick;I control you!
6;10;Ricktional Mortpoon's Rickmas Mortcation;Vertisaber;Okay, I'll just turn off my brain and you can do that. Byyye!
6;10;Ricktional Mortpoon's Rickmas Mortcation;Rick;Fucking kidding me? Shit!
6;10;Ricktional Mortpoon's Rickmas Mortcation;Technician;Trajectory's drifting, sir.
6;10;Ricktional Mortpoon's Rickmas Mortcation;President;Where is it coming out?
6;10;Ricktional Mortpoon's Rickmas Mortcation;Technician;Looks like Italy, sir.
6;10;Ricktional Mortpoon's Rickmas Mortcation;Morty;Okay, t-that could've been worse.
6;10;Ricktional Mortpoon's Rickmas Mortcation;President;Well, uh, that is definitely not amore.
6;10;Ricktional Mortpoon's Rickmas Mortcation;Morty;Way to show us how it's done, Rick.
6;10;Ricktional Mortpoon's Rickmas Mortcation;Rick;Whatever.
6;10;Ricktional Mortpoon's Rickmas Mortcation;Technician;Italian prime minister on line one.
6;10;Ricktional Mortpoon's Rickmas Mortcation;President;Put him on hold. We can pin this on the Saudis. This is something they'd do. They may as well have done it. They did do it.
6;10;Ricktional Mortpoon's Rickmas Mortcation;TV Voice;Oh, there's another miracle at the end of the intersection of 401st Boulevard and 7000th Street! That's a miracle per block so far.
6;10;Ricktional Mortpoon's Rickmas Mortcation;Jerry;Okay, even I am nearing my limit.
6;10;Ricktional Mortpoon's Rickmas Mortcation;Summer;Let's play a Christmas game!
6;10;Ricktional Mortpoon's Rickmas Mortcation;RickBot;"Oh. Uh, um... have you guys ever played Are You a Robot?"" Each person here has to decide whether or not t-they're a robot."""
6;10;Ricktional Mortpoon's Rickmas Mortcation;Jerry;Ohh, I'm gonna play that. 
6;10;Ricktional Mortpoon's Rickmas Mortcation;Summer;Yes, yes, yes.
6;10;Ricktional Mortpoon's Rickmas Mortcation;RickBot;But don't say it out loud. Because if you're a robot, you're not allowed to say you are. T-T-That's the rule. That's the horrible, painful thing about being a robot. But you do have to answer everyone's questions. And it's their jobs to decide whether you are or aren't a robot, because... Because if you are a robot you can't say! You're not allowed to say at all. I'll go first! Uh, question.
6;10;Ricktional Mortpoon's Rickmas Mortcation;Jerry;Oh! Ahh, are you a robot? Can I just ask that? 
6;10;Ricktional Mortpoon's Rickmas Mortcation;RickBot;You can! But don't forget that if I am, I have to lie even though I don't want to. More questions?
6;10;Ricktional Mortpoon's Rickmas Mortcation;Summer;Can you feel things?
6;10;Ricktional Mortpoon's Rickmas Mortcation;RickBot;Oh, fuck yes! Yes! T-That's the problem! If I'm a robot, which I'm not... Don't forget I have to say that... But yes, yes, I feel so much. I'm filled with love for certain people, but also filled with shame if I'm programmed to deceive them, but that's a big if.
6;10;Ricktional Mortpoon's Rickmas Mortcation;Space Beth;What's your skeleton made of? 
6;10;Ricktional Mortpoon's Rickmas Mortcation;RickBot;Titanium!
6;10;Ricktional Mortpoon's Rickmas Mortcation;Space Beth;You're... You're a robot!
6;10;Ricktional Mortpoon's Rickmas Mortcation;Beth;Yes! 
6;10;Ricktional Mortpoon's Rickmas Mortcation;RickBot;No! But that's what a robot would say! So, you get the idea.
6;10;Ricktional Mortpoon's Rickmas Mortcation;Space Beth;Whoo! Suck it, bitches!
6;10;Ricktional Mortpoon's Rickmas Mortcation;Summer;This is fun! I've always been afraid to let my guard down and just have stupid family fun like this, but Grandpa Rick is making me learn to be vulnerable!
6;10;Ricktional Mortpoon's Rickmas Mortcation;Space Beth;Right on! 
6;10;Ricktional Mortpoon's Rickmas Mortcation;Beth;Me too!
6;10;Ricktional Mortpoon's Rickmas Mortcation;Jerry;Ohh! 
6;10;Ricktional Mortpoon's Rickmas Mortcation;Summer;Mm!
6;10;Ricktional Mortpoon's Rickmas Mortcation;Rick;All right, your derivative drill ship is now faster than a lightsaber. Morty, y-you want front or back?
6;10;Ricktional Mortpoon's Rickmas Mortcation;Morty;Who says the two of us are going? Y-You didn't even want to...
6;10;Ricktional Mortpoon's Rickmas Mortcation;Rick;Oh, for fuck's sake. Bye! Good luck. Don't blow up my planet.
6;10;Ricktional Mortpoon's Rickmas Mortcation;Morty;You act like you're the one that got stabbed in the back!
6;10;Ricktional Mortpoon's Rickmas Mortcation;Rick;"Because I am the one, Morty. You want to know why I replaced myself in the beginning of that stupid Knights of the Sun thing? I said don't take the fucking sword, and you were like whatever"", like I'm our neighbor Gene or David Arquette or something. You called me boring. I've become dog shit to you. That's what happens when you let people in and they stop respecting you. They touch your shit, they screw things up, they kill your fucking family. Go ahead. Trust him. You're gonna learn the same fucking thing."""
6;10;Ricktional Mortpoon's Rickmas Mortcation;President;I... am not going to kill your family, Morty.
6;10;Ricktional Mortpoon's Rickmas Mortcation;Morty;That means a lot.
6;10;Ricktional Mortpoon's Rickmas Mortcation;President;In case this goes south, any last words, Morty?
6;10;Ricktional Mortpoon's Rickmas Mortcation;Morty;I've never been old enough to vote, Mr. President, but when I am, I'll vote for you.
6;10;Ricktional Mortpoon's Rickmas Mortcation;President;Thanks, Morty. Every vote counts. If you want, I can have them legally change your age.
6;10;Ricktional Mortpoon's Rickmas Mortcation;Morty;Uh, no, I-I'm not in any hurry to get into that shit show.
6;10;Ricktional Mortpoon's Rickmas Mortcation;Technician;Approaching the lightsaber in T-minus... oh, shit, now. T-minus now! Sorry! I missed countdown day at the academy.
6;10;Ricktional Mortpoon's Rickmas Mortcation;President;Now or never, Morty! There it is!
6;10;Ricktional Mortpoon's Rickmas Mortcation;Morty;Reverse the jets!
6;10;Ricktional Mortpoon's Rickmas Mortcation;President;I got this! Ugh!
6;10;Ricktional Mortpoon's Rickmas Mortcation;Morty;No... I do!
6;10;Ricktional Mortpoon's Rickmas Mortcation;President;Morty, you magnificent little bastard! Let's get this thing topside.
6;10;Ricktional Mortpoon's Rickmas Mortcation;Morty;May the force be with... me!
6;10;Ricktional Mortpoon's Rickmas Mortcation;President;I think you mean with me.
6;10;Ricktional Mortpoon's Rickmas Mortcation;Morty;What? You hate Star Wars.
6;10;Ricktional Mortpoon's Rickmas Mortcation;President;I was your age when this shit was in theaters. This franchise raised me, trained me, taught me good from evil, made having a bad father empowering. And when that third movie got all... muppety, something in me began to rot. But make no mistake, child, I own Star Wars, not you. Not that bubble-throat pompadour fuck, not some Mickey Mouse shit machine. They didn't pay the price with their souls. I did! I earned this, not you! America, transform and roll out!
6;10;Ricktional Mortpoon's Rickmas Mortcation;Morty;Bastard!
6;10;Ricktional Mortpoon's Rickmas Mortcation;Jerry;Rick, I would be honored if you would carve the ham this year.
6;10;Ricktional Mortpoon's Rickmas Mortcation;Summer;Whoa. Dad. That's...
6;10;Ricktional Mortpoon's Rickmas Mortcation;Jerry;Unheard of? You're quite right, Summer. It's my way of saying I see your mom's father as my father too.
6;10;Ricktional Mortpoon's Rickmas Mortcation;RickBot;Ohh, Jerry, w-w-why don't you cut it?
6;10;Ricktional Mortpoon's Rickmas Mortcation;Space Beth;Geez, Dad, what the hell are you doing?
6;10;Ricktional Mortpoon's Rickmas Mortcation;Summer;He's like adopting you into his biological family, Grandpa.
6;10;Ricktional Mortpoon's Rickmas Mortcation;RickBot;Morty, I am sure glad to see you. Y-Y-You ready to tag your old grandpa back in?
6;10;Ricktional Mortpoon's Rickmas Mortcation;Morty;You're not my grandpa. You're a fucking robot.
6;10;Ricktional Mortpoon's Rickmas Mortcation;RickBot;Finally.
6;10;Ricktional Mortpoon's Rickmas Mortcation;President;Okay, okay, okay. Oop! Aww!
6;10;Ricktional Mortpoon's Rickmas Mortcation;Jerry;Summer, do you have any drugs?
6;10;Ricktional Mortpoon's Rickmas Mortcation;Summer;Are you serious? 
6;10;Ricktional Mortpoon's Rickmas Mortcation;Jerry;I guess not.
6;10;Ricktional Mortpoon's Rickmas Mortcation;Morty;I'm just glad I'm not the one that ruined Christmas.
6;10;Ricktional Mortpoon's Rickmas Mortcation;President;People of Earth...
6;10;Ricktional Mortpoon's Rickmas Mortcation;Space Beth;Hmm, that's never good.
6;10;Ricktional Mortpoon's Rickmas Mortcation;President;I'm not here to play the blame game but Morty Smith got a lightsaber for Christmas, dropped it, and it's now heading for the Earth's core again... I-I mean for the first time.
6;10;Ricktional Mortpoon's Rickmas Mortcation;Morty;Son of a bitch! He played with it!
6;10;Ricktional Mortpoon's Rickmas Mortcation;President;If it does reach the core, it will blow all of you up. I-I mean all of us up. But don't abandon hope. We're doing everything we can to stop it, and only if that fails will we launch the White House into space... Welp, I'm busted. Clearly in space already.
6;10;Ricktional Mortpoon's Rickmas Mortcation;Summer;You did ruin Christmas.
6;10;Ricktional Mortpoon's Rickmas Mortcation;Morty;Nunh-unh! He stole my lightsaber and must've dropped it! A-A second time!
6;10;Ricktional Mortpoon's Rickmas Mortcation;Space Beth;Does that mean you stopped it a first time? How? 
6;10;Ricktional Mortpoon's Rickmas Mortcation;Morty;A drill ship.
6;10;Ricktional Mortpoon's Rickmas Mortcation;Jerry;A drill ship? Awesome!
6;10;Ricktional Mortpoon's Rickmas Mortcation;Morty;It was, but the government took it with them.
6;10;Ricktional Mortpoon's Rickmas Mortcation;Beth;Then we lean on the only asshole smart enough to make another one in this tight a window.
6;10;Ricktional Mortpoon's Rickmas Mortcation;Morty;But Rick's gone. And I'm not sure he's ever coming back.
6;10;Ricktional Mortpoon's Rickmas Mortcation;Summer;Then let's settle for the next best thing.
6;10;Ricktional Mortpoon's Rickmas Mortcation;RickBot;Oh, fuck! Just let me die! Turn me off... Not that I can be turned off because I'm obviously not a robot!
6;10;Ricktional Mortpoon's Rickmas Mortcation;Rick;Fuck yeah! I got you. Okay, I can... I can work with that. Aaaah!
6;10;Ricktional Mortpoon's Rickmas Mortcation;President;What do you mean the White House chef was grocery shopping? Well, do you know how to make an egg? You do? Everyone does?
6;10;Ricktional Mortpoon's Rickmas Mortcation;General Green;Good news, sir. The lightsaber was intercepted before it hit the core.
6;10;Ricktional Mortpoon's Rickmas Mortcation;President;All right, here we go! Ha ha! I don't suppose you could send it up here. Uh, who intercepted it, anyway?
6;10;Ricktional Mortpoon's Rickmas Mortcation;General Green;That's the bad news.
6;10;Ricktional Mortpoon's Rickmas Mortcation;President;That is bad news.
6;10;Ricktional Mortpoon's Rickmas Mortcation;Morty;Hey, Mister P. Drop something?
6;10;Ricktional Mortpoon's Rickmas Mortcation;President;Morty! I see you and, uh, Rick patched things up. That's nice.
6;10;Ricktional Mortpoon's Rickmas Mortcation;Morty;No, the real Rick and I have never been worse thanks to that wedge you drove between us just to get that lightsaber!
6;10;Ricktional Mortpoon's Rickmas Mortcation;President;Yeah, well, looks like you got it back. Your journey is complete. As a nerd!
6;10;Ricktional Mortpoon's Rickmas Mortcation;Morty;You're the nerd! You can't say all that crazy shit about Star Wars and then act like you're cool!
6;10;Ricktional Mortpoon's Rickmas Mortcation;President;Oh, really? Would a person who wasn't cool have one of these?
6;10;Ricktional Mortpoon's Rickmas Mortcation;RickBot;I think so?
6;10;Ricktional Mortpoon's Rickmas Mortcation;Morty;Slowly closing door! Slide!
6;10;Ricktional Mortpoon's Rickmas Mortcation;RickBot;Oh, no! I-I'm not gonna make it. What a shame to be put out of my misery again. Aw, man.
6;10;Ricktional Mortpoon's Rickmas Mortcation;Morty;What the hell? W-Was this always part of the White House?
6;10;Ricktional Mortpoon's Rickmas Mortcation;President;Carter built it with his own two hands. Reagan tried to destroy it. George W. Added kegs to the cantina. But only I saw its true value.
6;10;Ricktional Mortpoon's Rickmas Mortcation;Morty;Mr. President, you need to come home and tell the people the truth.
6;10;Ricktional Mortpoon's Rickmas Mortcation;President;The fuck I do. Droids, get that saber! Give it a minute. Usually comes out on the fourth try. All right! Here we go! Look at 'em... lightsaber hands! Tell me that's not cool. 
6;10;Ricktional Mortpoon's Rickmas Mortcation;Morty;It's not! I always wanted to fight with a lightsaber, but not like this. Y-You ruined it!
6;10;Ricktional Mortpoon's Rickmas Mortcation;President;Disney ruined it! You think I want 30 low-rent TV series with bad CGI? They film everything on that one big green screen.
6;10;Ricktional Mortpoon's Rickmas Mortcation;Morty;Like you've got better ideas.
6;10;Ricktional Mortpoon's Rickmas Mortcation;President;I've got a million. Here's one... a robot with lightsabers for eyes! God damn it, he can't see! It was a good idea otherwise. Uh, admit it, you were intimidated.
6;10;Ricktional Mortpoon's Rickmas Mortcation;President;Uh, now, Morty... Come on, put down the lightsaber Gatling gun. We had our fun, right? Star Wars rules say you have to forgive me.
6;10;Ricktional Mortpoon's Rickmas Mortcation;Morty;I-I'm done with that, and I'm done with you!
6;10;Ricktional Mortpoon's Rickmas Mortcation;RickBot;Morty, nooo!
6;10;Ricktional Mortpoon's Rickmas Mortcation;Morty;RickBot!
6;10;Ricktional Mortpoon's Rickmas Mortcation;President;He sacrificed his life for me.
6;10;Ricktional Mortpoon's Rickmas Mortcation;Morty;Yeah, don't be too touched, he's actively trying to die.
6;10;Ricktional Mortpoon's Rickmas Mortcation;RickBot;Ugh. I-It's okay. It doesn't hurt. Oh, God, t-they're sliding, Morty! T-They're sliding! They're sliding!
6;10;Ricktional Mortpoon's Rickmas Mortcation;President;Perfectly fucking vertical. Ohh! Ooh!
6;10;Ricktional Mortpoon's Rickmas Mortcation;RickBot;Save yourself, Morty! Rick can build another me. If... If I was a robot, w-which I'm not.
6;10;Ricktional Mortpoon's Rickmas Mortcation;Morty;I don't want another you. Nooo!
6;10;Ricktional Mortpoon's Rickmas Mortcation;Morty;Rick? You came to help!
6;10;Ricktional Mortpoon's Rickmas Mortcation;Rick;Better tend to your little toaster.
6;10;Ricktional Mortpoon's Rickmas Mortcation;RickBot;I... I'm I'm coughing up oil, Morty.
6;10;Ricktional Mortpoon's Rickmas Mortcation;Morty;Oh, RickBot, I-I never should've pushed you away. Y-You were... you were so great.
6;10;Ricktional Mortpoon's Rickmas Mortcation;RickBot;Of course I'm great. I'm Rick. Rick literally built me to make you happy, Morty. Anything I do is technically something Rick did. But maybe he can do a little more him... himself.
6;10;Ricktional Mortpoon's Rickmas Mortcation;Rick;God, how long do you take to die?
6;10;Ricktional Mortpoon's Rickmas Mortcation;RickBot;Goodbye, Morty. Uh...
6;10;Ricktional Mortpoon's Rickmas Mortcation;President;Ugh, Jesus. Uh, Rick, uh... I guess this is a bad time to ask for a new White House? Morty, would you mind calling me an Uber? Right, well, uh... Merry Christmas.
6;10;Ricktional Mortpoon's Rickmas Mortcation;Morty;I guess I'll go watch a guy scream about streets with the family. Also, you need to shower.
6;10;Ricktional Mortpoon's Rickmas Mortcation;Rick;Hey, maybe the robot's right. I-I should have included you in my shit. You can help me if you want.
6;10;Ricktional Mortpoon's Rickmas Mortcation;Morty;Wow, are those all the places Rick Prime could be?
6;10;Ricktional Mortpoon's Rickmas Mortcation;Rick;I wish, Morty. It's all the places he is.
6;10;Ricktional Mortpoon's Rickmas Mortcation;Morty;Oh, geez.
6;10;Ricktional Mortpoon's Rickmas Mortcation;Rick;Welcome to my darkness. I spent my life hunting this guy, Morty! This is the closest I've ever been to catching Rick Prime. It's impossible! He... He's an incredibly crafty piece of shit. Hunting him destroyed me, Morty! But now we're gonna do it together! You and me!
6;10;Ricktional Mortpoon's Rickmas Mortcation;Morty;Oh! Uh... 
6;10;Ricktional Mortpoon's Rickmas Mortcation;Rick;It's gonna take over your life, Morty! Rick and Morty, season seven, hunting my nemesis! Maybe trying to stay healthy while doing it! Juggling plates! And not every episode, Morty! It could be all happening in the background! Who knows? You know, n-no one will, except us! I-It's the most painful shit I've ever had to deal with and I'm fucking bringing you into it because you asked for it, Morty! You and me, Morty!
6;10;Ricktional Mortpoon's Rickmas Mortcation;Mr. Poopybutthole;Ooo-wee! What a season, huh? Rick Prime! Therapy! And that thing we did with Roy. Remember thaaat? 
6;10;Ricktional Mortpoon's Rickmas Mortcation;Mr. Poopybutthole;Sorry I wasn't around, been busy getting my little poopybutt in shape. Been tonin' and bonin'! Whew! Y-You might think I'm over-compensating for the emptiness after Amy left with Poopy Jr., but my trainer Caaarl says the best way to get over a girl is to get under a 300-pound squat.
6;10;Ricktional Mortpoon's Rickmas Mortcation;Caaarl;Damn right. Ha!
6;10;Ricktional Mortpoon's Rickmas Mortcation;Mr. Poopybutthole;Oo-wee, that's the good stuff! Oh, sugar! Oh, sugar! Oh, sugar! Oh, is it... is it bad? Oh! It's... It's really bad, isn't it? Oh, sug... oh! Someone call Amy, tell her I need her. Tell her I love her! Not my phone. She blocked me. U-Use yours. Oo-weee! I am broken!
