4;1;Edge Of Tomorty: Rick. Die. Rickpeat;Summer;Morty's on Jessica's Instagram again.
4;1;Edge Of Tomorty: Rick. Die. Rickpeat;Morty;Get out of here, jerk!
4;1;Edge Of Tomorty: Rick. Die. Rickpeat;Jerry;What's so embarrassing, Morty? Sharing it with your family might help.
4;1;Edge Of Tomorty: Rick. Die. Rickpeat;Beth;Summer, stop shaming your brother. Morty, stop being a creepy, perverted cyberstalker.
4;1;Edge Of Tomorty: Rick. Die. Rickpeat;Morty;I'm not cyberstalking! I-I-I just wanted to know where she got this necklace from. And now I know. Her... Her... Her grandma left it to her.
4;1;Edge Of Tomorty: Rick. Die. Rickpeat;Jerry;You're quiet, Rick. Shouldn't you be revealing grandmas aren't real?
4;1;Edge Of Tomorty: Rick. Die. Rickpeat;Rick;Hi. I've placed an auto-response chip in my brain, so I can spend time with my family.
4;1;Edge Of Tomorty: Rick. Die. Rickpeat;Beth;But you are spending time with your family.
4;1;Edge Of Tomorty: Rick. Die. Rickpeat;Rick;Thank you for talking to Rick.
4;1;Edge Of Tomorty: Rick. Die. Rickpeat;Rick;Alright, I'm finished with my breakfast and my Amazon wish list. Let's go, Morty. I need death crystals from Forbodulon Prime.
4;1;Edge Of Tomorty: Rick. Die. Rickpeat;Jerry;Uh...
4;1;Edge Of Tomorty: Rick. Die. Rickpeat;Beth;Dad? There's a way we do this now.
4;1;Edge Of Tomorty: Rick. Die. Rickpeat;Rick;Morty, would you please accompany me to Forbodulon Prime for death crystals?
4;1;Edge Of Tomorty: Rick. Die. Rickpeat;Morty;Well, thank you for asking. Yes, I will do that.
4;1;Edge Of Tomorty: Rick. Die. Rickpeat;Summer;It is a hot photo. I think grief flushes your cheeks. Dad, you hardly put any syrup on.
4;1;Edge Of Tomorty: Rick. Die. Rickpeat;Beth;Honey, stop raising your father's cholesterol so you can take a hot funeral selfie.
4;1;Edge Of Tomorty: Rick. Die. Rickpeat;Summer;I never get to do anything.
4;1;Edge Of Tomorty: Rick. Die. Rickpeat;Morty;Uh, Rick, maybe if we go a little...
4;1;Edge Of Tomorty: Rick. Die. Rickpeat;Rick;Faster? Good idea, Morty. It'll get us through these asteroids sooner.
4;1;Edge Of Tomorty: Rick. Die. Rickpeat;Morty;Geez, you're really this pissed about my mom making sure I'm okay with our adventures?
4;1;Edge Of Tomorty: Rick. Die. Rickpeat;Rick;What's next, Morty? What if I want you to jump off the Empire State Building? I have to ask? 
4;1;Edge Of Tomorty: Rick. Die. Rickpeat;Morty;Yes?
4;1;Edge Of Tomorty: Rick. Die. Rickpeat;Rick;And you seriously don't see how that's a slippery slope? Just shut up and help me with these, please.
4;1;Edge Of Tomorty: Rick. Die. Rickpeat;Morty;Why are they called death crystals? D-Do they kill you?
4;1;Edge Of Tomorty: Rick. Die. Rickpeat;Rick;You're thinking of bullets, Morty. Death crystals show you how you're gonna die.
4;1;Edge Of Tomorty: Rick. Die. Rickpeat;Morty;Jesus Christ! I-I die a million times?
4;1;Edge Of Tomorty: Rick. Die. Rickpeat;Rick;Your future stems from your present, which, if you're living right, keeps changing. Truth is, anyone that knows how they're definitely gonna die is either boring as hell, or about to get shot. Duck!
4;1;Edge Of Tomorty: Rick. Die. Rickpeat;Morty;Who are those guys?!
4;1;Edge Of Tomorty: Rick. Die. Rickpeat;Rick;Crystal poachers. There's no lower form of life. They think the galaxy's their own personal piggy bank.
4;1;Edge Of Tomorty: Rick. Die. Rickpeat;Morty;Wait, then what are we?
4;1;Edge Of Tomorty: Rick. Die. Rickpeat;Rick;We're Rick and Morty. You're about to witness the only real use for these crystals. They show you when the other guy's reloading.
4;1;Edge Of Tomorty: Rick. Die. Rickpeat;Rick;Certain death, certain death, certain death, uncertain death.
4;1;Edge Of Tomorty: Rick. Die. Rickpeat;Rick;And certain death, certain death, certain death. Definitely gonna get shot by this guy, this is totally my fate. Nothing I could possibly do... Okay, now, not so much. Help me gather these up.
4;1;Edge Of Tomorty: Rick. Die. Rickpeat;Morty;You just use these to win fights? 
4;1;Edge Of Tomorty: Rick. Die. Rickpeat;Rick;I don't use them. People that spend their life avoiding death are already dead. They're also rich, and I like to spend my life with their money.
4;1;Edge Of Tomorty: Rick. Die. Rickpeat;Morty;Oh, my God.
4;1;Edge Of Tomorty: Rick. Die. Rickpeat;Old Jessica;Morty!
4;1;Edge Of Tomorty: Rick. Die. Rickpeat;Morty;Jessica! Oh!
4;1;Edge Of Tomorty: Rick. Die. Rickpeat;Old Jessica;I love you. Morty. I love you.
4;1;Edge Of Tomorty: Rick. Die. Rickpeat;Morty;Oh! Jessica. I want to die with Jessica. Ahh!
4;1;Edge Of Tomorty: Rick. Die. Rickpeat;Rick;What are you doing?
4;1;Edge Of Tomorty: Rick. Die. Rickpeat;Morty;Oh, um, c-can I drive?
4;1;Edge Of Tomorty: Rick. Die. Rickpeat;Rick;Why?
4;1;Edge Of Tomorty: Rick. Die. Rickpeat;Morty;The... feel of the open road?
4;1;Edge Of Tomorty: Rick. Die. Rickpeat;Rick;Alright! Who's this grandson? I like his style.
4;1;Edge Of Tomorty: Rick. Die. Rickpeat;Rick;Morty, you know outer space is up, right? 
4;1;Edge Of Tomorty: Rick. Die. Rickpeat;Morty;Yeah, yeah. I'm just, uh, following... my... instincts.
4;1;Edge Of Tomorty: Rick. Die. Rickpeat;Rick;Will you just go up?
4;1;Edge Of Tomorty: Rick. Die. Rickpeat;Morty;Stop! You're gonna make me die wrong!
4;1;Edge Of Tomorty: Rick. Die. Rickpeat;Rick;Wait a minute, what? Morty, do you have a death crystal in your pocket?
4;1;Edge Of Tomorty: Rick. Die. Rickpeat;Morty;No! Maybe!
4;1;Edge Of Tomorty: Rick. Die. Rickpeat;Rick;You little monster! I thought you were masturbating! 
4;1;Edge Of Tomorty: Rick. Die. Rickpeat;Morty;And you took that in stride?!
4;1;Edge Of Tomorty: Rick. Die. Rickpeat;Rick;You'd rather I address it?!
4;1;Edge Of Tomorty: Rick. Die. Rickpeat;Morty;Why would I be doing it?!
4;1;Edge Of Tomorty: Rick. Die. Rickpeat;Rick;Why would you steal a death crystal?!
4;1;Edge Of Tomorty: Rick. Die. Rickpeat;Morty;I want to die old!
4;1;Edge Of Tomorty: Rick. Die. Rickpeat;Rick;Then stop driving!
4;1;Edge Of Tomorty: Rick. Die. Rickpeat;Morty;No!
4;1;Edge Of Tomorty: Rick. Die. Rickpeat;Rick;You son of a bitch! Give me the wheel, Morty. Goddamn it.
4;1;Edge Of Tomorty: Rick. Die. Rickpeat;Morty;Ohhh, shit. Oh, shit, oh, shit, oh, shit, oh, shit.
4;1;Edge Of Tomorty: Rick. Die. Rickpeat;Old Jessica;I love you, Morty.
4;1;Edge Of Tomorty: Rick. Die. Rickpeat;Hologram Rick;I will avenge my death.
4;1;Edge Of Tomorty: Rick. Die. Rickpeat;Morty;Holy shit!
4;1;Edge Of Tomorty: Rick. Die. Rickpeat;Hologram Rick;"Just kidding. I'm a crisis detection and correction hologram generated by a chip that real"" Rick put in your spine. ""Real"" in quotes because calling density-privileged entities ""real"" is incredibly holo-phobic."""
4;1;Edge Of Tomorty: Rick. Die. Rickpeat;Hologram Rick;Morty, do me a solid... problematic wordplay aside... Grab the gun with the blue handle from the trunk and get a tissue sample from the corpse. Alright, now take that to the trunk, and insert it into the clone compiler.
4;1;Edge Of Tomorty: Rick. Die. Rickpeat;Hologram Rick;I see you appear to be holding a death crystal that's guiding your decisions more than I am. That's your right. I just want to remind you that some people can't hold anything and can never die, so that's a little offensive to... Oh, okay.
4;1;Edge Of Tomorty: Rick. Die. Rickpeat;Hologram Rick;Listen, I'm programmed for tolerance, Morty. So I'm willing to accept that you're doing this if you're willing to accept that you need to stop.
4;1;Edge Of Tomorty: Rick. Die. Rickpeat;Garage Computer Voice;Accepting. Rerouted. Backup. Data. Operation. Phoenix. Initiated.
4;1;Edge Of Tomorty: Rick. Die. Rickpeat;Rick;What the hell? I axed this protocol.
4;1;Edge Of Tomorty: Rick. Die. Rickpeat;Fascist Rick;What are you doing with my clone?
4;1;Edge Of Tomorty: Rick. Die. Rickpeat;Rick;It's okay. I'm you. I took my own clone vat offline a couple seasons ago, so I think my backup got rerouted to your universe. I'm sorry. 
4;1;Edge Of Tomorty: Rick. Die. Rickpeat;Fascist Rick;All good. Happy to help. By the way, annoying that I even have to ask, but you are down with fascist dystopias, right?
4;1;Edge Of Tomorty: Rick. Die. Rickpeat;Rick;YYYYYes.
4;1;Edge Of Tomorty: Rick. Die. Rickpeat;Fascist Rick;"That yes"" was pretty... Liberal with the letter ""Y."""""
4;1;Edge Of Tomorty: Rick. Die. Rickpeat;Fascist Morty;Well, isn't this strange. I trust, the kind of strange that makes Rick and Morty... stronger.
4;1;Edge Of Tomorty: Rick. Die. Rickpeat;Rick;Morty, I caught this socialist in my bathrobe. He wants to give all of our martinis to a family of immigrants.
4;1;Edge Of Tomorty: Rick. Die. Rickpeat;Fascist Rick;Obviously, the most likely imposter is the wet, naked clone.
4;1;Edge Of Tomorty: Rick. Die. Rickpeat;Fascist Morty;It is obvious. But it won't be to the police.
4;1;Edge Of Tomorty: Rick. Die. Rickpeat;Rick;Ohh! 'Kay.
4;1;Edge Of Tomorty: Rick. Die. Rickpeat;Fascist Morty;He was an inferior Rick. He was too political. I want to have fun, classic Rick-and-Morty adventures like in the old days.
4;1;Edge Of Tomorty: Rick. Die. Rickpeat;Rick;Then we'll get along fine, Fascist Morty. For starters, I just need to get to Forbodulon Prime...
4;1;Edge Of Tomorty: Rick. Die. Rickpeat;Fascist Morty;You will go where I want you to go!!
4;1;Edge Of Tomorty: Rick. Die. Rickpeat;Rick;Fuck.
4;1;Edge Of Tomorty: Rick. Die. Rickpeat;Hologram Rick;Hey, hey! Ho, ho! Not cloning your grandpa has got to go! Hey, hey! Ho, ho! Not cloning your grandpa has got to go!
4;1;Edge Of Tomorty: Rick. Die. Rickpeat;Morty;You don't get out of my face, I'm gonna flush Rick's DNA.
4;1;Edge Of Tomorty: Rick. Die. Rickpeat;Hologram Rick;Alright. Okay, regroup, everybody. You, too, Berkeley! Snap out of it.
4;1;Edge Of Tomorty: Rick. Die. Rickpeat;Hologram Rick;At least tell me what this death is that you're so determined to... Oh. Jessica.
4;1;Edge Of Tomorty: Rick. Die. Rickpeat;Old Jessica;Morty, I love...
4;1;Edge Of Tomorty: Rick. Die. Rickpeat;Morty;What?! No, no! No, no, no!
4;1;Edge Of Tomorty: Rick. Die. Rickpeat;Old Jessica;I love you.
4;1;Edge Of Tomorty: Rick. Die. Rickpeat;Morty;Damn it! How am I gonna die with her if I can't even talk to her?
4;1;Edge Of Tomorty: Rick. Die. Rickpeat;Hologram Rick;Here's an idea, Morty. Throw that thing in the garbage, stop planning your own death, and talk to whoever you want.
4;1;Edge Of Tomorty: Rick. Die. Rickpeat;Morty;Now you just sound like Real Rick.
4;1;Edge Of Tomorty: Rick. Die. Rickpeat;Hologram Rick;You're better than that language, Morty.
4;1;Edge Of Tomorty: Rick. Die. Rickpeat;Morty;I ain't better than shit, Jack.
4;1;Edge Of Tomorty: Rick. Die. Rickpeat;Rick;So, uh, w-what are we doing?
4;1;Edge Of Tomorty: Rick. Die. Rickpeat;Fascist Morty;Stop asking questions. Stop doing meta-commentary. Just have fun. We're going on a simple, fun, classic adventure.
4;1;Edge Of Tomorty: Rick. Die. Rickpeat;Rick;Okay, you know what? It would really help if you could just say anything other than what you don't want.
4;1;Edge Of Tomorty: Rick. Die. Rickpeat;Fascist Morty;I like Mr. Meeseeks.
4;1;Edge Of Tomorty: Rick. Die. Rickpeat;Rick;Okay, now we're talking. You know what? I usually keep a Meeseeks box in my glove compartment, so maybe Fascist Rick does, too.
4;1;Edge Of Tomorty: Rick. Die. Rickpeat;Fascist Morty;Ah! 
4;1;Edge Of Tomorty: Rick. Die. Rickpeat;Rick;Well, look at that. Now we're doing something we've done before.
4;1;Edge Of Tomorty: Rick. Die. Rickpeat;Mr. Meeseeks;I'm Mr. Meeseeks!
4;1;Edge Of Tomorty: Rick. Die. Rickpeat;Rick;Kill this Nazi prick!
4;1;Edge Of Tomorty: Rick. Die. Rickpeat;Mr. Meeseeks;Can do! Come here, you son of a bitch!
4;1;Edge Of Tomorty: Rick. Die. Rickpeat;Fascist Morty;No! Stop!
4;1;Edge Of Tomorty: Rick. Die. Rickpeat;Garage Computer Voice;Accepting. Rerouted. Backup. Data. Operation. Phoenix. Initiated.
4;1;Edge Of Tomorty: Rick. Die. Rickpeat;Rick;Aw, come on, man.
4;1;Edge Of Tomorty: Rick. Die. Rickpeat;Shrimp Rick;Whoa, are you okay?
4;1;Edge Of Tomorty: Rick. Die. Rickpeat;Rick;Yeah, sorry. I'm a Rick from another reality. I-I got uploaded to your clone vat.
4;1;Edge Of Tomorty: Rick. Die. Rickpeat;Shrimp Rick;Hey, don't worry about it, man. I have a dozen.
4;1;Edge Of Tomorty: Rick. Die. Rickpeat;Shrimp Morty;W-W-What the heck, Rick? Are you making clones down here?
4;1;Edge Of Tomorty: Rick. Die. Rickpeat;Shrimp Rick;Get outta here, Morty! Stop asking stupid questions, Morty!
4;1;Edge Of Tomorty: Rick. Die. Rickpeat;Rick;Stop asking stupid questions, Morty! You sound like a piece of shit.
4;1;Edge Of Tomorty: Rick. Die. Rickpeat;Morty;Aw, geez.
4;1;Edge Of Tomorty: Rick. Die. Rickpeat;Shrimp Rick;"So, tell the truth, man. No shame. You're looking at your shrimp body like What?!"""""
4;1;Edge Of Tomorty: Rick. Die. Rickpeat;Rick;Ah, is it that obvious? I'm sorry. Yeah, my original body is more bipedal... uh, ape-descended.
4;1;Edge Of Tomorty: Rick. Die. Rickpeat;Shrimp Rick;Really! Weird. Does your house look like a tree, or...
4;1;Edge Of Tomorty: Rick. Die. Rickpeat;Rick;No, it looks like this. It's, like, identical to this, actually.
4;1;Edge Of Tomorty: Rick. Die. Rickpeat;Shrimp Rick;That is such a mind fuck.
4;1;Edge Of Tomorty: Rick. Die. Rickpeat;Rick;It's all good, man. I'm fine with it. Honestly, you're doing me a huge favor by being shrimp instead of fascists.
4;1;Edge Of Tomorty: Rick. Die. Rickpeat;Rick;What? Goddamn it! When did this shit become the default?!
4;1;Edge Of Tomorty: Rick. Die. Rickpeat;Mr. Goldenfold;Who wants to come up to the board and show me some basic-ass integers?
4;1;Edge Of Tomorty: Rick. Die. Rickpeat;Old Jessica;I love you, Morty.
4;1;Edge Of Tomorty: Rick. Die. Rickpeat;Morty;Aah!
4;1;Edge Of Tomorty: Rick. Die. Rickpeat;Mr. Goldenfold;Morty? Yeah, right.
4;1;Edge Of Tomorty: Rick. Die. Rickpeat;Mr. Goldenfold;That's not an integer!
4;1;Edge Of Tomorty: Rick. Die. Rickpeat;Morty;Apparently, it doesn't matter.
4;1;Edge Of Tomorty: Rick. Die. Rickpeat;Mr. Goldenfold;Damn, Morty, you're bad at math, but I'm giving you an A-plus in confidence.
4;1;Edge Of Tomorty: Rick. Die. Rickpeat;Morty;Just doin' what I gotta do.
4;1;Edge Of Tomorty: Rick. Die. Rickpeat;Mr. Goldenfold;Extra credit!
4;1;Edge Of Tomorty: Rick. Die. Rickpeat;Old Jessica;I love you, Morty. I love you, Morty.
4;1;Edge Of Tomorty: Rick. Die. Rickpeat;Red-haired Bully;What's with the strut? You think you own this school?
4;1;Edge Of Tomorty: Rick. Die. Rickpeat;Morty;Nope!
4;1;Edge Of Tomorty: Rick. Die. Rickpeat;Red-haired Bully;"What if I killed you? Would you be strutting then? Only if the events of the Pixar movie Coco"" are to be believed, which I doubt."""
4;1;Edge Of Tomorty: Rick. Die. Rickpeat;Morty;I have it on good authority that you're probably not gonna kill me. So why don't you do what I do and just go with the flow? Nice and Zen, baby.
4;1;Edge Of Tomorty: Rick. Die. Rickpeat;Red-haired Bully;Aah! Ugh! Ugh! Ugh! Ugh! Impotence! Aah! Impotent rage! Ugh! Ugh! Ugh! 
4;1;Edge Of Tomorty: Rick. Die. Rickpeat;Red-haired Bully;"You die tomorrow, no matter what. It's what bullies call a fait accompli."""""
4;1;Edge Of Tomorty: Rick. Die. Rickpeat;Morty;Oh, man! Oh, shit!
4;1;Edge Of Tomorty: Rick. Die. Rickpeat;Hologram Rick;Well, well, well. Mm. Looks like you got yourself in a lick of trouble, huh, Morty?
4;1;Edge Of Tomorty: Rick. Die. Rickpeat;Morty;Okay, okay, look, if you help me not die, I'll bring Rick back to life. Why are you pretending to eat chicken?
4;1;Edge Of Tomorty: Rick. Die. Rickpeat;Hologram Rick;Excuse me? This chicken is quite real to me.
4;1;Edge Of Tomorty: Rick. Die. Rickpeat;Morty;Yeah, okay, but it doesn't have...
4;1;Edge Of Tomorty: Rick. Die. Rickpeat;Hologram Rick;Nutrients?
4;1;Edge Of Tomorty: Rick. Die. Rickpeat;Morty;Yeah.
4;1;Edge Of Tomorty: Rick. Die. Rickpeat;Hologram Rick;What's the last thing you ate?
4;1;Edge Of Tomorty: Rick. Die. Rickpeat;Morty;Baloney and an orange.
4;1;Edge Of Tomorty: Rick. Die. Rickpeat;Hologram Rick;So, no holographic foods? So, to me, you never ate? Or we could try respecting each other.
4;1;Edge Of Tomorty: Rick. Die. Rickpeat;Morty;Will you just show me how to stay alive?
4;1;Edge Of Tomorty: Rick. Die. Rickpeat;Hologram Rick;Alright, Morty, a deal's a deal. Once we bring your Rick back to life, then I'll help you with the bully. Go ahead and open the hatch to the subterranean lab. That's where all the cloning equipment is. 
4;1;Edge Of Tomorty: Rick. Die. Rickpeat;Hologram Rick;Please tell me you're not hitting that crystal again. Look, Rick might be the epitome of bloated flesh privilege, but he's right about one thing. You're gonna be a lot happier if you focus on the moment, rather than on how you're gonna die. I mean, w-who's worried about that, huh?
4;1;Edge Of Tomorty: Rick. Die. Rickpeat;Morty;Sorry, Hologram Rick. I'm going with the crystal on this one.
4;1;Edge Of Tomorty: Rick. Die. Rickpeat;Old Jessica;Morty.
4;1;Edge Of Tomorty: Rick. Die. Rickpeat;Hologram Rick;Oh, alright, okay. Just because I can't interact with solid matter means you can just walk all over me? Dear God.
4;1;Edge Of Tomorty: Rick. Die. Rickpeat;Teddy Rick;Bist du faschistisch?
4;1;Edge Of Tomorty: Rick. Die. Rickpeat;Rick;Nope.
4;1;Edge Of Tomorty: Rick. Die. Rickpeat;Red-haired Bully;Finally. I thought maybe you were pussying out. Hyah! What the fuck? Oh, the air's getting thin!
4;1;Edge Of Tomorty: Rick. Die. Rickpeat;Brown-haired Bully;Well, well, well, looks like there's a new bully in town! Lucky for us, he just made bully-bullying the new bullying! Bully him! Aah!
4;1;Edge Of Tomorty: Rick. Die. Rickpeat;Cop;We've got an Akira-type situation going on behind the mall. Over.
4;1;Edge Of Tomorty: Rick. Die. Rickpeat;Morty;Dying with Jessica...
4;1;Edge Of Tomorty: Rick. Die. Rickpeat;Cop;Hey! What the hell? Aah! Aah!
4;1;Edge Of Tomorty: Rick. Die. Rickpeat;Mr. Meeseeks;I'm Mr. Meeseeks! Look at me!
4;1;Edge Of Tomorty: Rick. Die. Rickpeat;Morty;Shield me from the law!
4;1;Edge Of Tomorty: Rick. Die. Rickpeat;Mr. Meeseeks;Yes, sir! Can do!
4;1;Edge Of Tomorty: Rick. Die. Rickpeat;Cop;Stand down!
4;1;Edge Of Tomorty: Rick. Die. Rickpeat;Mr. Meeseeks;Look at me!
4;1;Edge Of Tomorty: Rick. Die. Rickpeat;Morty;I... will... die... old!
4;1;Edge Of Tomorty: Rick. Die. Rickpeat;Male News Presenter;Up next, an unstoppable science-fiction boy is attacking our nation's final line of defense. Will we all fall to his deadly touch?
4;1;Edge Of Tomorty: Rick. Die. Rickpeat;Female News Presenter;But first, something silly?
4;1;Edge Of Tomorty: Rick. Die. Rickpeat;Male News Presenter;"What do you mean, but first""? I already said ""up next."" You always do this."""
4;1;Edge Of Tomorty: Rick. Die. Rickpeat;Female News Presenter;I don't always do shit. Don't gaslight me.
4;1;Edge Of Tomorty: Rick. Die. Rickpeat;Male News Presenter;Gaslighting doesn't exist. You made it up 'cause you're fucking crazy.
4;1;Edge Of Tomorty: Rick. Die. Rickpeat;Soldier;Why are you letting me do this?
4;1;Edge Of Tomorty: Rick. Die. Rickpeat;Morty;I do as the crystal guides.
4;1;Edge Of Tomorty: Rick. Die. Rickpeat;Lawyer;Your Honor, my client was acting in self-defense.
4;1;Edge Of Tomorty: Rick. Die. Rickpeat;Judge;He turned 13 men into piles of ash. Sit down! Before I sentence you, is there anything you have to say for yourself?
4;1;Edge Of Tomorty: Rick. Die. Rickpeat;Morty;I... w-w-will a-al-sways... always r-r-remember o-our... our... our... v-v-t-time... time... I-in... f-g-g-g-P-P-Peru. I will always remember our time in Peru, Your Honor.
4;1;Edge Of Tomorty: Rick. Die. Rickpeat;Lawyer;Your Honor, as you can see, my client is speaking nonsense.
4;1;Edge Of Tomorty: Rick. Die. Rickpeat;Judge;Stop. Those were my husband's last words.
4;1;Edge Of Tomorty: Rick. Die. Rickpeat;Morty;He says that he... l-loves you... ttt-llll-lit-lit-little... little ff-gg-sp-spa-ffggarrow... sparrow! He loves you, little sparrow.
4;1;Edge Of Tomorty: Rick. Die. Rickpeat;Judge;He's innocent. Case dismissed. I'm coming for you, Condor!
4;1;Edge Of Tomorty: Rick. Die. Rickpeat;TV Presenter;Well, I, for one, will not be accepting this verdict. And this little monster may think he's gotten away, but there is something called the court of public opinion that still has final say in this country. Oh, I guess he's coming out of the courthouse now. Let's go live to that.
4;1;Edge Of Tomorty: Rick. Die. Rickpeat;TV Presenter;People, I gotta tell you something. That little boy... I thought I knew everything about everything. But something about the tones and frequencies that just came out of his mouth have made me... I mean, I think we're just about ready to forgive him and move past this whole thing. He's a free young man. And as far as continuity goes, the reset button's been hit.
4;1;Edge Of Tomorty: Rick. Die. Rickpeat;Jessica;Morty! That was a fast trial.
4;1;Edge Of Tomorty: Rick. Die. Rickpeat;Morty;Jess-i-ca?
4;1;Edge Of Tomorty: Rick. Die. Rickpeat;Jessica;A bunch of us girls were gonna go skinny-dipping later, if you wanted to join. Actually, now, really. We're gonna do it right now. This is the last conversation I'm having about it fully clothed.
4;1;Edge Of Tomorty: Rick. Die. Rickpeat;Morty;No, thanks. I'm... assuming... we... maybe... get together... in our 40s?
4;1;Edge Of Tomorty: Rick. Die. Rickpeat;Jessica;Uh, cool. Sounds... hot. Bye.
4;1;Edge Of Tomorty: Rick. Die. Rickpeat;Morty;Must... continue... moving... in ways... that lead... to dying... with you.
4;1;Edge Of Tomorty: Rick. Die. Rickpeat;Wasp Rick;Whoa! Way to use up a clone! What the fuck, man? What's the matter with you? Y-Y-You don't talk? Tarantula got your tongue?
4;1;Edge Of Tomorty: Rick. Die. Rickpeat;Rick;Uh... Heil, Wasp Hitler?
4;1;Edge Of Tomorty: Rick. Die. Rickpeat;Wasp Rick;What? What the fuck? Where's that shit coming from?
4;1;Edge Of Tomorty: Rick. Die. Rickpeat;Rick;Look, I'm a primate. I-I'm having a hard time. I'll think or say whatever gets me home.
4;1;Edge Of Tomorty: Rick. Die. Rickpeat;Wasp Rick;Well, here's how it works with wasps. We eat our prey alive, and when we don't, we lay our eggs in their eyeballs so that our young can feast on their brains when they hatch. When you're born that big an asshole, the least you can do is have a little empathy. Now, come have dinner with my beautiful family. And drop the Hitler stuff. Wasp Morty's been on some crazy message boards.
4;1;Edge Of Tomorty: Rick. Die. Rickpeat;Larva Mr. Goldenfold;Aah! Aah! Oh! Aah! Ow!
4;1;Edge Of Tomorty: Rick. Die. Rickpeat;Wasp Summer;Me and my friends want to fly around and look for something to sting tonight.
4;1;Edge Of Tomorty: Rick. Die. Rickpeat;Wasp Jerry;You be careful not to waste all your venom.
4;1;Edge Of Tomorty: Rick. Die. Rickpeat;Wasp Summer;I'm not a bee, Dad.
4;1;Edge Of Tomorty: Rick. Die. Rickpeat;Larva Mr. Goldenfold;Oh, God! Kill me! Please kill me!
4;1;Edge Of Tomorty: Rick. Die. Rickpeat;Wasp Rick;Uh, Beth, uh, after dinner, could I maybe borrow Morty to help the lost Rick get back to his primate-based reality?
4;1;Edge Of Tomorty: Rick. Die. Rickpeat;Wasp Beth;Morty, are you done with your homework?
4;1;Edge Of Tomorty: Rick. Die. Rickpeat;Wasp Morty;Not all of it.
4;1;Edge Of Tomorty: Rick. Die. Rickpeat;Wasp Beth;Sorry, Dad.
4;1;Edge Of Tomorty: Rick. Die. Rickpeat;Wasp Rick;Oh, don't be sorry, sweetie. We're all in this together. We're wasps, not monsters.
4;1;Edge Of Tomorty: Rick. Die. Rickpeat;Larva Mr. Goldenfold;Aah!
4;1;Edge Of Tomorty: Rick. Die. Rickpeat;Rick;Huh, guess I don't have it as bad as I thought.
4;1;Edge Of Tomorty: Rick. Die. Rickpeat;Wasp Beth;Can you pass the acid?
4;1;Edge Of Tomorty: Rick. Die. Rickpeat;Larva Mr. Goldenfold;Aah! No! Run! Run, my babies!
4;1;Edge Of Tomorty: Rick. Die. Rickpeat;Wasp Morty;Bonus!
4;1;Edge Of Tomorty: Rick. Die. Rickpeat;Rick;Morty?
4;1;Edge Of Tomorty: Rick. Die. Rickpeat;Wasp Rick;Morty?
4;1;Edge Of Tomorty: Rick. Die. Rickpeat;Rick;Where is that little shit? Morty! Whoa, garage foul. Who said you could go through my stuff? W-Where's my Boglin? There you are. Don't worry, Pop-pop's back. I'll keep you safe. What the... He took my Meeseeks boxes! All that's left are these Kirkland brand Meeseeks boxes.
4;1;Edge Of Tomorty: Rick. Die. Rickpeat;Mr. Meeseeks (Kirkland);What do you want?
4;1;Edge Of Tomorty: Rick. Die. Rickpeat;Wasp Rick;Damn, your Morty sucks.
4;1;Edge Of Tomorty: Rick. Die. Rickpeat;Hologram Rick;Aah, wasps!
4;1;Edge Of Tomorty: Rick. Die. Rickpeat;Rick;Why the hell didn't you show Morty how to bring my body back to life? Don't tell me you gained sentience and tried to take over.
4;1;Edge Of Tomorty: Rick. Die. Rickpeat;Hologram Rick;What? That is some A.I., racist, accusatory, Isaac Asimov bullshit right there.
4;1;Edge Of Tomorty: Rick. Die. Rickpeat;Rick;Then what happened? Where's my body?
4;1;Edge Of Tomorty: Rick. Die. Rickpeat;Hologram Rick;Oh, you're gonna love this.
4;1;Edge Of Tomorty: Rick. Die. Rickpeat;Old Jessica;I love you, Morty.
4;1;Edge Of Tomorty: Rick. Die. Rickpeat;Morty;This is my life. This is good.
4;1;Edge Of Tomorty: Rick. Die. Rickpeat;Wasp Rick;What do ya know? Our little Morty knows how to scream.
4;1;Edge Of Tomorty: Rick. Die. Rickpeat;Hologram Rick;Oh, you're fucked now! I told you! Get him, Rick!
4;1;Edge Of Tomorty: Rick. Die. Rickpeat;Morty;Aaaah! Aah! I-I can't see my own death. H-How am I gonna die?!
4;1;Edge Of Tomorty: Rick. Die. Rickpeat;Rick;Shh, quiet, idiot. Quiet. It's gonna be alright. You don't get to know how you're gonna die. It's over.
4;1;Edge Of Tomorty: Rick. Die. Rickpeat;Hologram Rick;Oh, hey. This ferrofluid's wrapping around my legs. I can feel! I have mass! I'm a god now! You're fucked!
4;1;Edge Of Tomorty: Rick. Die. Rickpeat;Morty;What the fuck? I-I thought you were proud to be a hologram!
4;1;Edge Of Tomorty: Rick. Die. Rickpeat;Hologram Rick;That's 'cause I had to be one!
4;1;Edge Of Tomorty: Rick. Die. Rickpeat;Hologram Rick;Shit! Aaah! Ugh! Aaah!
4;1;Edge Of Tomorty: Rick. Die. Rickpeat;Rick;There's a lesson here, and I'm not the one that's gonna figure it out.
4;1;Edge Of Tomorty: Rick. Die. Rickpeat;Morty;Hey, uh, sorry I didn't listen to you and tried to kill the whole world and stuff. I guess I got to learn how to live in the moment a little more.
4;1;Edge Of Tomorty: Rick. Die. Rickpeat;Rick;"Oh, boy, so, you actually learned something today? What is this, Full House""? I was living in the moment all day, and it kept getting me killed by Nazis. I think you have to think ahead and live in the moment."""
4;1;Edge Of Tomorty: Rick. Die. Rickpeat;Beth;Morty, we saw you on the news. Are you okay?
4;1;Edge Of Tomorty: Rick. Die. Rickpeat;Jerry;Oh, real nice, Rick. Turning our son into an Akira? Real nice.
4;1;Edge Of Tomorty: Rick. Die. Rickpeat;Rick;Eat my ass, Jerry. He turned himself into Akira.
4;1;Edge Of Tomorty: Rick. Die. Rickpeat;Jerry;Oh, I'll eat it, because this is my house, Rick. I'll eat any I want.
4;1;Edge Of Tomorty: Rick. Die. Rickpeat;Rick;Gross.
4;1;Edge Of Tomorty: Rick. Die. Rickpeat;Beth;You said the crystals wouldn't hurt anyone, Dad. This family has a clean start. I don't know if adventures fit into my son's life.
4;1;Edge Of Tomorty: Rick. Die. Rickpeat;Morty;I'm fine. Get off Rick's back. Rick wasn't even here when I was doing all that stuff. That was all on me.
4;1;Edge Of Tomorty: Rick. Die. Rickpeat;Beth;Well, alright, Morty. I guess, as long as you're okay, that's all we care about.
4;1;Edge Of Tomorty: Rick. Die. Rickpeat;Jerry;I don't want to see any more anime stuff happening to my son, buster.
4;1;Edge Of Tomorty: Rick. Die. Rickpeat;Rick;That finger has AIDs now. Not my fault.
4;1;Edge Of Tomorty: Rick. Die. Rickpeat;Jerry;You skipped HIV?
4;1;Edge Of Tomorty: Rick. Die. Rickpeat;Beth;He's messing with you, sweetie.
4;1;Edge Of Tomorty: Rick. Die. Rickpeat;Jerry;But it's tingling!
4;1;Edge Of Tomorty: Rick. Die. Rickpeat;Morty;So, I guess what we learned is to split the diff.
4;1;Edge Of Tomorty: Rick. Die. Rickpeat;Rick;From now on, Rick and Morty doing a little of this and a little of that.
4;1;Edge Of Tomorty: Rick. Die. Rickpeat;Morty;Yeah, sometimes we'll do classic stuff. You know, other times, we'll do whatever!
4;1;Edge Of Tomorty: Rick. Die. Rickpeat;Rick;Sometimes we won't even do anything! Rick and Morty do... not doing anything!
4;1;Edge Of Tomorty: Rick. Die. Rickpeat;Morty;A hundred years! 
4;1;Edge Of Tomorty: Rick. Die. Rickpeat;Rick;Pushing it to the limit. Rick and Morty, not sticking to one path.
4;1;Edge Of Tomorty: Rick. Die. Rickpeat;Morty;Trying different things, making sure to keep out of a rut. Doing stuff. Sometimes not doing stuff.
4;1;Edge Of Tomorty: Rick. Die. Rickpeat;Rick;Not even pushing a little bit towards the limit. Doing it alone or together.
4;1;Edge Of Tomorty: Rick. Die. Rickpeat;Morty;Making sure to keep our eyes on the prize. Sometimes just relaxing.
4;1;Edge Of Tomorty: Rick. Die. Rickpeat;Rick;Or not. And you can do whatever the you want, Morty.
4;1;Edge Of Tomorty: Rick. Die. Rickpeat;Morty;That's the end.
4;1;Edge Of Tomorty: Rick. Die. Rickpeat;Rick;Wait, wait, what the fuck? H-Hold on. What the fuck did you just say?
4;1;Edge Of Tomorty: Rick. Die. Rickpeat;Summer;Nothing I didn't say anything. I was just playing along with you guys.
4;1;Edge Of Tomorty: Rick. Die. Rickpeat;Rick;You know I record everything, right? Garage, isolate Summer's voice and play back.
4;1;Edge Of Tomorty: Rick. Die. Rickpeat;Summer;Oh, and then you guys can get married, and, like, each other off in a testosterone-addled third-grade-boy cumfest.
4;1;Edge Of Tomorty: Rick. Die. Rickpeat;Morty;What, the hell, Summer?! That's disgusting.
4;1;Edge Of Tomorty: Rick. Die. Rickpeat;Rick;Gross, Summer! Jesus Christ!
4;1;Edge Of Tomorty: Rick. Die. Rickpeat;Summer;I was just joking around, you... Just seeing if you guys pay any attention to me. Just want to be a part of the fun.
4;1;Edge Of Tomorty: Rick. Die. Rickpeat;Rick;Get the fuck out of here! Get out of here, Summer! Fucking disgusting!
4;1;Edge Of Tomorty: Rick. Die. Rickpeat;Morty;Get out of here!
4;1;Edge Of Tomorty: Rick. Die. Rickpeat;Rick;You ruined the Season 4 premiere, you ruined it!
4;1;Edge Of Tomorty: Rick. Die. Rickpeat;Tricia;God, tomorrow's career day. I don't want to think about what I do when I get out of school.
4;1;Edge Of Tomorty: Rick. Die. Rickpeat;Jessica;"I know exactly what I want to do. I want to work in hospice. I want to comfort the people who are dying, who have no one else in their lives... The real lonely people. I'm gonna look at their name tags, and I'm gonna say, I love you"", followed by whatever it says on their name tag, over and over."""
4;1;Edge Of Tomorty: Rick. Die. Rickpeat;Morty;What the fuck?
4;1;Edge Of Tomorty: Rick. Die. Rickpeat;Rick;Hey, Morty, quick favor.
4;1;Edge Of Tomorty: Rick. Die. Rickpeat;Morty;What, cover me in gasoline and spiders? Fine, yeah, I'm in.
4;1;Edge Of Tomorty: Rick. Die. Rickpeat;Rick;Wasn't my first pitch, but, hey, not gonna waste this opportunity.
4;2;The Old Man And The Seat;Rick;We're out of syrup. Huh. You know what? Maybe I'll use my intern. Glootie?
4;2;The Old Man And The Seat;Glootie;Good?
4;2;The Old Man And The Seat;Rick;Thanks, Glootie.
4;2;The Old Man And The Seat;Glootie;Anything else? Do you want to develop an app?
4;2;The Old Man And The Seat;Rick;No thanks, Glootie.
4;2;The Old Man And The Seat;Morty;Hey, what's up, Glootie?
4;2;The Old Man And The Seat;Glootie;Hi, Morty. Do you want to develop an app?
4;2;The Old Man And The Seat;Morty;No thanks.
4;2;The Old Man And The Seat;Jerry;"Rick, why does it say, Do not develop my app"", on your intern's forehead?"""
4;2;The Old Man And The Seat;Glootie;Why, you want to develop one?
4;2;The Old Man And The Seat;Rick;Ah, I'm glad you asked that, Jerry. It's so you don't develop his app. Glootie, go make some photocopies of something. 
4;2;The Old Man And The Seat;Glootie;Cool. Well, if anyone wants to develop an app with me, I'm down.
4;2;The Old Man And The Seat;Beth;He seems to really want to develop an app.
4;2;The Old Man And The Seat;Rick;He really does, sweetie, but nobody's gonna do that. Now, if you'll excuse me, I've got a quick solo adventure to go on, and this one will not be directed by Ron Howard. 
4;2;The Old Man And The Seat;Summer;He's gonna go poop. When Grandpa Rick pats his belly like that and leaves without Morty, it means he's going to go poop. He's a shy pooper. He has a secret pooping place.
4;2;The Old Man And The Seat;Rick;Man, you, Summer.
4;2;The Old Man And The Seat;Beth;Honey, why can't you get this excited about your SATs?
4;2;The Old Man And The Seat;Jerry;"Well, I'm man enough to simply say, I'm going to poop"", and I'd be honored to have Ron Howard involved."""
4;2;The Old Man And The Seat;Beth;Good job, hon. 
4;2;The Old Man And The Seat;Summer;Way to go, Dad.
4;2;The Old Man And The Seat;Morty;We're rooting for ya.
4;2;The Old Man And The Seat;Jerry;He's really putting you to work, huh?
4;2;The Old Man And The Seat;Glootie;Did you want to develop an app?
4;2;The Old Man And The Seat;Jerry;I'll pass, Glootie.
4;2;The Old Man And The Seat;Glootie;Hmm, your loss.
4;2;The Old Man And The Seat;Jerry;Oh, yeah? Why's that?
4;2;The Old Man And The Seat;Glootie;Eh, it's an app you'd want to develop.
4;2;The Old Man And The Seat;Jerry;Can I ask what it is?
4;2;The Old Man And The Seat;Glootie;Of course you can. That's always the first step in app development.
4;2;The Old Man And The Seat;Jerry;Ah. 50/50! Final offer!
4;2;The Old Man And The Seat;Rick;Reverse digestion extrapolation. 
4;2;The Old Man And The Seat;Rick;Time to meet your maker.
4;2;The Old Man And The Seat;Morty;What are you guys doing? Did you develop an app?
4;2;The Old Man And The Seat;Jerry;Rule number one in app development, son... Never follow the rules.
4;2;The Old Man And The Seat;Morty;Except when the rule is tattooed on an alien's forehead, Dad. Why do you think Rick would have that rule?
4;2;The Old Man And The Seat;Jerry;'Cause he's a disrupt-o-phobe.
4;2;The Old Man And The Seat;Morty;No, Dad, no. To keep something horrible from happening, something he's too lazy to explain.
4;2;The Old Man And The Seat;Glootie;Guys, we're getting our first users.
4;2;The Old Man And The Seat;Summer;Whoa, this new app just matched mewith a guy that is su my ty. Super my type. Learn to abbre. Hey!
4;2;The Old Man And The Seat;Beth;Your su ty works at Jersey Mike's and sees 25 Phish shows a year.
4;2;The Old Man And The Seat;Summer;That is so Danny.
4;2;The Old Man And The Seat;Danny;Summer!
4;2;The Old Man And The Seat;Summer;Danny?
4;2;The Old Man And The Seat;Danny;Summer Smith?
4;2;The Old Man And The Seat;Summer;"Danny Publits from Lovefinderrz, with two R's"" and a ""Z""?"""
4;2;The Old Man And The Seat;Danny;I ran all the way here while staring at your profile. I tripped on a fire hydrant and fell down, so I'm covered in gravel that stuck to my sweat. And even after a shower, I'll still be into a jam band for old junkies, but I think this world cares too much about bands and too little about love. And I think I love you.
4;2;The Old Man And The Seat;Summer;Me, too.
4;2;The Old Man And The Seat;Beth;Hi, I'm my underaged daughter's mother. Nice to... whoa! Come on! Just met!
4;2;The Old Man And The Seat;Woman;Uh, this isn't working.
4;2;The Old Man And The Seat;Man;Wait. What are you... Never mind.
4;2;The Old Man And The Seat;Clerk;I quit, I'm gay, and I love Xander.
4;2;The Old Man And The Seat;Beth;Stupid phones are destroying us.
4;2;The Old Man And The Seat;Jerry;Hey, sweetie.
4;2;The Old Man And The Seat;Beth;Honey, our daughter ran off with a Frisbee golfer because of some app with a really dumb, really forgettable name. Like a really dumb, uncreative, super sweaty name. Anyway, I'll be late. I love you.
4;2;The Old Man And The Seat;Jerry;Got it. I love you, too.
4;2;The Old Man And The Seat;Jerry;Okay, Glootie, take the app down.
4;2;The Old Man And The Seat;Glootie;Can't take it down. I'm just an intern.
4;2;The Old Man And The Seat;Glootie;Uh, that's not how apps work.
4;2;The Old Man And The Seat;Morty;Then make it how it works.
4;2;The Old Man And The Seat;Glootie;This isn't how making things work works.
4;2;The Old Man And The Seat;Morty;Get... get it off the server. Y-You think we're stupid, but we're not. We know apps have something to do with servers.
4;2;The Old Man And The Seat;Glootie;The server's on the mother ship.
4;2;The Old Man And The Seat;Morty;Where's the mother ship?
4;2;The Old Man And The Seat;Glootie;It's coming.
4;2;The Old Man And The Seat;Jerry;Take us to it.
4;2;The Old Man And The Seat;Glootie;No.
4;2;The Old Man And The Seat;Jerry;Yes. Shake him more, Morty. That was working.
4;2;The Old Man And The Seat;Morty;Take us to the mother ship.
4;2;The Old Man And The Seat;Glootie;Okay, don't hurt me. Don't hurt me.
4;2;The Old Man And The Seat;Jerry;An ominous beeping app. You can't stay made at a guy with this kind of talent.
4;2;The Old Man And The Seat;Morty;Dad, you can, and you have to.
4;2;The Old Man And The Seat;Frog Restaurant Employee #1;Ribbit, ribbit.
4;2;The Old Man And The Seat;Frog Restaurant Employee #2;Ribbit, ribbit.
4;2;The Old Man And The Seat;Frog Restaurant Employee #1;Hey, ribbit, ribbit, ribbit!
4;2;The Old Man And The Seat;Frog Restaurant Employee #2;Ribbit, ribbit, ribbit!
4;2;The Old Man And The Seat;Vermigurber;Look at this guy. He wants to eat me so bad. You want to eat me, don't you?
4;2;The Old Man And The Seat;Frog Mob;Ribbit.
4;2;The Old Man And The Seat;Vermigurber;Just kidding. Have some drugs.
4;2;The Old Man And The Seat;Rick;Are you Vermigurber?
4;2;The Old Man And The Seat;Vermigurber;What does this guy want? Who is this monkey?
4;2;The Old Man And The Seat;Rick;I'm here about a sandwich.
4;2;The Old Man And The Seat;Vermigurber;Oh, well you came to the right place... 'Cause you're about to get a bullet sandwich on two slices of whole... gun.
4;2;The Old Man And The Seat;Rick;You might want to get that.
4;2;The Old Man And The Seat;Vermigurber;Hello?
4;2;The Old Man And The Seat;Voice;Dad, give the human whatever he wants. He knows where I live. He's crazy!
4;2;The Old Man And The Seat;Vermigurber;You fucking idiot. I have 800,000 kids.
4;2;The Old Man And The Seat;Rick;Don't forget your voicemail.
4;2;The Old Man And The Seat;Automated male voice;You have 470,000 messages.
4;2;The Old Man And The Seat;Vermigurber;Oh, ah, that's half of them. Okay, w-w-what do you want? What do you want? 
4;2;The Old Man And The Seat;Vermigurber;Wait, this is seriously about sandwiches? I thought this was about drugs or guns or the fact that I'm a fly that runs a frog restaurant. There's a million things that are interesting about me, and none of them are sandwiches.
4;2;The Old Man And The Seat;Rick;Who ordered it?
4;2;The Old Man And The Seat;Vermigurber;Talk to our delivery drone. He... he run off to fight in the robot wars.
4;2;The Old Man And The Seat;Vermigurber;Hey, ape man, I hope this was worth making a whole swarm of enemies.
4;2;The Old Man And The Seat;Rick;It will be, when I find whoever shit in my toilet.
4;2;The Old Man And The Seat;Vermigurber;Is that code for something? Someone look that up. If that's drug slang, I need to know it.
4;2;The Old Man And The Seat;Summer;Mom, you can't stop true love.
4;2;The Old Man And The Seat;Beth;Oh, yes, I can.
4;2;The Old Man And The Seat;Summer;You're assaulting me!
4;2;The Old Man And The Seat;Beth;Keep your voice down.
4;2;The Old Man And The Seat;Summer;I'm being assaulted!
4;2;The Old Man And The Seat;Beth;Oh, yeah? Okay. Statutory rape!
4;2;The Old Man And The Seat;Danny;Whoa.
4;2;The Old Man And The Seat;Beth;My daughter's about to be raped!
4;2;The Old Man And The Seat;Summer;No, I'm not! I'm being assaulted!
4;2;The Old Man And The Seat;Beth;Rape!
4;2;The Old Man And The Seat;Summer;Assault!
4;2;The Old Man And The Seat;Beth;Rape!
4;2;The Old Man And The Seat;Motel host;Nobody cares. It's a motel. Nobody's here because their life's going so great they can afford to get mixed up in yours. Deal with this on your own.
4;2;The Old Man And The Seat;Summer;You can't stop us from getting a motel room.
4;2;The Old Man And The Seat;Beth;Fine. I'll get one, too. I'm getting the one next door, and I'm putting a glass to the wall, and I'm listening.
4;2;The Old Man And The Seat;Summer;Fine. Enjoy.
4;2;The Old Man And The Seat;Beth;I will.
4;2;The Old Man And The Seat;Danny;I'm Danny, by the way.
4;2;The Old Man And The Seat;Beth;You had your chance, dick.
4;2;The Old Man And The Seat;Morty;Take your app down.
4;2;The Old Man And The Seat;Jerry;T-Take... take it down.
4;2;The Old Man And The Seat;Monogatron #1;What?
4;2;The Old Man And The Seat;Glootie;I'm their hostage.
4;2;The Old Man And The Seat;Monogatron #1;Do they have weapons?
4;2;The Old Man And The Seat;Glootie;Nope, but neither do I.
4;2;The Old Man And The Seat;Morty;Do... do you have a weapon?
4;2;The Old Man And The Seat;Glootie;No.
4;2;The Old Man And The Seat;Morty;Take the app down.
4;2;The Old Man And The Seat;Jerry;Take the app down.
4;2;The Old Man And The Seat;Monogatron #1;I can't. I'm an intern.
4;2;The Old Man And The Seat;Morty;Okay, well who tells interns what to do?
4;2;The Old Man And The Seat;Monogatron #1;Not you, that's for sure.
4;2;The Old Man And The Seat;Morty;Take us to whoever does, or w-w-we'll... we'll punch you.
4;2;The Old Man And The Seat;Monogatron #1;Okay.
4;2;The Old Man And The Seat;Jerry;Not bad, Morty.
4;2;The Old Man And The Seat;Morty;Yeah, I don't know when the other shoe's gonna drop, but this is working pretty good so far.
4;2;The Old Man And The Seat;Monogatron Leader;Greetings. We are the Monogatrons. While your species was still toying with fire, ours mastered the science of functioning, committed relationships. As the latest planet to develop our app, you will now witness the true power of superior intimacy.
4;2;The Old Man And The Seat;Jerry;Take the app down.
4;2;The Old Man And The Seat;Morty;Take it down, or... we'll... we'll... we'll punch you.
4;2;The Old Man And The Seat;Monogatron Leader;Is there someone with a gun or...
4;2;The Old Man And The Seat;Glootie;It's on its way.
4;2;The Old Man And The Seat;Monogatron Leader;The app remains up.
4;2;The Old Man And The Seat;Jerry;So what's the evil plan?
4;2;The Old Man And The Seat;Monogatron Leader;Does there have to be an evil plan?
4;2;The Old Man And The Seat;Monogatron #2;Oh, uh, uh... Uh, someone wanted a gun?
4;2;The Old Man And The Seat;Glootie;I'll take it. Thanks.
4;2;The Old Man And The Seat;Monogatron Leader;Here's the evil plan.
4;2;The Old Man And The Seat;Jerry;Fuck!
4;2;The Old Man And The Seat;Morty;Goddamn it.
4;2;The Old Man And The Seat;Monogatron Leader;As a preapp civilization, your love's value is defined by scarcity. You are highly trained to seek it, and you have no idea how to maintain it. Had you bothered to master love, you would've learned by now, it is as abundant as water.
4;2;The Old Man And The Seat;Monogatron Leader;You know what isn't? Water. That shit runs out. So we'll be taking yours. While your planet continues to dick around with a, uh... What is their version of it called?
4;2;The Old Man And The Seat;Glootie;"Lovefinderrz, with two R's"" and a ""Z."""""
4;2;The Old Man And The Seat;Monogatron Leader;Oof.
4;2;The Old Man And The Seat;Glootie;Yeah, not my idea.
4;2;The Old Man And The Seat;Jerry;Goddamn.
4;2;The Old Man And The Seat;Monogatron Queen;Am I interrupting?
4;2;The Old Man And The Seat;Monogatron Leader;Impossible. Here she is.
4;2;The Old Man And The Seat;Monogatron Queen;Mwah. Your prisoners are getting away.
4;2;The Old Man And The Seat;Monogatron Leader;Prisoners are just things. Connect with me. Tell me about your day.
4;2;The Old Man And The Seat;Monogatron Queen;I had an incredible meeting. Did you know humans are 80% water? And I found a new podcast we can listen to tonight. 
4;2;The Old Man And The Seat;Monogatron Leader;Love it. Okay, back to work. Find and kill those earthlings.
4;2;The Old Man And The Seat;Robot #1;We're outnumbered. There's no hope.
4;2;The Old Man And The Seat;Robot #2;Then we go out in glory. Flesh intruder, prepare to die.
4;2;The Old Man And The Seat;Rick;Oh, hold on.
4;2;The Old Man And The Seat;Robot #2;My apologies, Lieutenant Commander.
4;2;The Old Man And The Seat;Rick;No problem. At ease, Soldier.
4;2;The Old Man And The Seat;Rick;Initiate Employee Evaluation Mode.
4;2;The Old Man And The Seat;Robot #3;Accessing delivery archive.
4;2;The Old Man And The Seat;Rick;Okay, listen. You delivered an avian protein club sandwich with no lettu... Goddamn it.
4;2;The Old Man And The Seat;Lizard People;Oy, scoping for this bit, then?
4;2;The Old Man And The Seat;Rick;Alright, a-a-alright. I know you want to have the big guy/little guy fight, but... Aw, are you fucking kidding me?
4;2;The Old Man And The Seat;Alien newscaster;Here at the Midland Quasar, where, in a complete upset, the Robolution has overturned the lizards. It's totally unexpected.
4;2;The Old Man And The Seat;Tony;Uh, I understand, Mr. Phillips. Yes. 
4;2;The Old Man And The Seat;Rick;I believe this is yours. You, uh... you dropped that.
4;2;The Old Man And The Seat;Tony;I'll have to call you back.
4;2;The Old Man And The Seat;Rick;Where do you want to die?
4;2;The Old Man And The Seat;Tony;Susan, is conference room three available?
4;2;The Old Man And The Seat;Tony;Can I look at a photo of my wife while you kill me?
4;2;The Old Man And The Seat;Rick;Sure, but I'm doing her a favor. She either has terrible taste, or she's trapped in a marriage to a toilet thief.
4;2;The Old Man And The Seat;Tony;She's dead. And I don't mind joining her. Life has been hollow since I lost her. Using your toilet was nice, though. I'm a bit of a shy pooper. I'm ready when you are.
4;2;The Old Man And The Seat;Rick;Stay there.
4;2;The Old Man And The Seat;Rick;Tell him what you told me.
4;2;The Old Man And The Seat;Other Tony;What is this? What's happening?
4;2;The Old Man And The Seat;Rick;Tell him what you told me.
4;2;The Old Man And The Seat;Other Tony;My wife's still alive. Sh... sh... she went into remission 10 years ago.
4;2;The Old Man And The Seat;Rick;And what did you do today?
4;2;The Old Man And The Seat;Other Tony;Oh, I, uh, pooped on a really awesome toilet I found...
4;2;The Old Man And The Seat;Rick;Don't use your dead wife as an excuse. You shit on my toilet because you don't know your place, and your place is nothing. So, next time you stumble onto a toilet that feels too good for your ass, trust me, it is.
4;2;The Old Man And The Seat;Tony;You're not gonna kill me?
4;2;The Old Man And The Seat;Rick;Don't tell me what to do!
4;2;The Old Man And The Seat;Rick;Are you fucking kidding me?
4;2;The Old Man And The Seat;Rick;Oh, so you like being alive? So why the fuck are you back here?
4;2;The Old Man And The Seat;Tony;After you left, I thought about what you said and how much I needed to hear it, but then I thought about why you were saying it, who you were really saying it to. You need the same thing I needed, Rick. You need someone to give you, permission to live.
4;2;The Old Man And The Seat;Rick;What the...? I thought you were a shy pooper.
4;2;The Old Man And The Seat;Tony;You know what shy pooping is, Rick? It's a pointless bid for control. You want to take the one part of life that you truly think is yours, and you want to protect it from a universe that takes whatever it wants. It took my wife. It clearly took something from you. We can spend our lives fighting that, or we can choose to be free.
4;2;The Old Man And The Seat;Rick;You're right, Tony. I'm done fighting. Time to be free.
4;2;The Old Man And The Seat;Tony;Oh, wait, you're actually gonna... Oh, God! Oh, God!
4;2;The Old Man And The Seat;Tony;Where am I?
4;2;The Old Man And The Seat;Tony's Wife;Hi, little mouse.
4;2;The Old Man And The Seat;Tony;Baby bee? I missed you so much.
4;2;The Old Man And The Seat;Tony's Wife;I never really left you.
4;2;The Old Man And The Seat;Tony;Then you know that a few years ago I started getting into...
4;2;The Old Man And The Seat;Tony's Wife;Strap-on porn? Yes. I thought it was hot. Now, come on.
4;2;The Old Man And The Seat;Tony;Where are you going?
4;2;The Old Man And The Seat;Tony's Wife;To poop.
4;2;The Old Man And The Seat;Tony;Where?
4;2;The Old Man And The Seat;Tony's Wife;Wherever you want, forever.
4;2;The Old Man And The Seat;Tony;My God.
4;2;The Old Man And The Seat;God;You rang? I'm pooping, too.
4;2;The Old Man And The Seat;Tony's Wife;Come, Tony. Come on. Come poop with me. Poop with me, Tony. Poop with me.
4;2;The Old Man And The Seat;God;What are you waiting for? Aren't you gonna join us, Tony? Aren't you gonna join us in the pooping?
4;2;The Old Man And The Seat;Tony;Where are we? What is this?
4;2;The Old Man And The Seat;Rick;That's it. Get out.
4;2;The Old Man And The Seat;Tony;You can make a perfectly-realized, toilet-filled simulation of heaven, but you can't share a toilet?
4;2;The Old Man And The Seat;Rick;Don't insult my craft. The chemical is Globaflyn. It connects the whatever-you-want section of your brain to the whatever-you-have section. If your heaven is toilets, that's on you.
4;2;The Old Man And The Seat;Tony;All of these people...
4;2;The Old Man And The Seat;Rick;Are living their wildest, meaningless dreams and leaving me out of them.
4;2;The Old Man And The Seat;Tony;People you refuse to kill and refuse to let into your life. 
4;2;The Old Man And The Seat;Rick;An offer you rejected, so here's your last chance. Goodbye forever. If you touch my toilet again, you die.
4;2;The Old Man And The Seat;Tony;You need a friend. 
4;2;The Old Man And The Seat;Rick;I have a million cooler friends than you.
4;2;The Old Man And The Seat;Tony;I'll be seeing you. 
4;2;The Old Man And The Seat;Rick;You'll be dying.
4;2;The Old Man And The Seat;Tony;We're gonna be friends.
4;2;The Old Man And The Seat;Rick;You're gonna be dead.
4;2;The Old Man And The Seat;Jerry;So, we fight our way to the gas line, we cut it, and then we set a fire.
4;2;The Old Man And The Seat;Morty;Okay. Alright.
4;2;The Old Man And The Seat;Jerry;"Morty, Adventures of Jerry and Morty,"" huh? Put her there."""
4;2;The Old Man And The Seat;Morty;Dad, look, y-you know, w-we don't need to high-five. It's... it's kind of your fault that we're in this situation at all.
4;2;The Old Man And The Seat;Jerry;"I know, but, you know, come on. Adventures of Jerry and Morty."""""
4;2;The Old Man And The Seat;Morty;Okay.
4;2;The Old Man And The Seat;Summer;Jeff, I can explain everything.
4;2;The Old Man And The Seat;Jeff;You don't have to. Can you just marry us instead?
4;2;The Old Man And The Seat;Richard;Jeff, don't do it!
4;2;The Old Man And The Seat;Jeff;Richard.
4;2;The Old Man And The Seat;Running Bird;Maggie.
4;2;The Old Man And The Seat;Maggie;Running Bird.
4;2;The Old Man And The Seat;Running Bird;Let's get out of here.
4;2;The Old Man And The Seat;Josiah;Priest Witherspoon.
4;2;The Old Man And The Seat;Priest Witherspoon;Josiah? Let's get the fuck out of here.
4;2;The Old Man And The Seat;Soulmate #1;Summer Smith, let's get the hell out of here.
4;2;The Old Man And The Seat;Summer;You had me at my own name. Oh, yeah, no. Why would I...?
4;2;The Old Man And The Seat;Beth;Summer! Fucking thing. Come on. I can't steer this.
4;2;The Old Man And The Seat;Farmer;What in the hell are you doing?
4;2;The Old Man And The Seat;Beth;Parenting.
4;2;The Old Man And The Seat;Farmer;That's not how I did it.
4;2;The Old Man And The Seat;Beth;Yeah, where's your daughter?
4;2;The Old Man And The Seat;Farmer;Ah, you're right. She joined ISIS.
4;2;The Old Man And The Seat;Jerry;It's Glootie, and he's had a change of heart. And he's going to set us free.
4;2;The Old Man And The Seat;Glootie;Actually, he's been blamed for bringing you aboard and assigned to execute you.
4;2;The Old Man And The Seat;Jerry;Whoa, whoa, whoa. Okay. What would your girlfriend think of you murdering?
4;2;The Old Man And The Seat;Glootie;I happen to be between relationships right now.
4;2;The Old Man And The Seat;Jerry;Really? I thought your species had perfected relationships. Here. 
4;2;The Old Man And The Seat;Glootie;We're not allowed to use those apps.
4;2;The Old Man And The Seat;Jerry;I wonder why. Yeah, that's what I thought, Glootie. Looks like you and I... Are all we've got.
4;2;The Old Man And The Seat;Glootie;I'm not helping you any more than that, but if you can find the hangar, grab a ship and get the hell out of here.
4;2;The Old Man And The Seat;Jerry;Where you going, Glootie?
4;2;The Old Man And The Seat;Glootie;I've got a date with dumping a dating app. Glootie-ootie-ooh!
4;2;The Old Man And The Seat;Jerry;Was that ever his thing?
4;2;The Old Man And The Seat;Morty;No.
4;2;The Old Man And The Seat;Jerry;He never exited that way.
4;2;The Old Man And The Seat;Morty;No, first time. Dad, I want to say something. I started today disgusted and embarrassed to be your son, and then later I thought we were gonna die because you're a loser.
4;2;The Old Man And The Seat;Jerry;There's no more, is there?
4;2;The Old Man And The Seat;Morty;Nope.
4;2;The Old Man And The Seat;Jerry;Now quit fucking up, and let's go.
4;2;The Old Man And The Seat;Rick;Is Tony here? I br... I brought him some, uh, Vegan Fiber Chili, delicious family recipe, and a box of these, uh, chocolates, sugar free. He can eat as many of these as he wants. Anyways, uh, just wanted to drop these off, and you tell him, uh, the toilet's all his. H-He... he'll know what I mean.
4;2;The Old Man And The Seat;Susan;Tony died.
4;2;The Old Man And The Seat;Rick;Excuse me?
4;2;The Old Man And The Seat;Susan;He quit his job, starting living life to the fullest. He crashed into a tree space-skiing down Mount Space Everest.
4;2;The Old Man And The Seat;Rick;"Fuck. There's a Mount Space Everest? Okay. Uh, Jesus. I-I got to process this. Oh, no, no. You... you don't want to eat that. Y-y-you'll... you'll... you'll become the opening of The Beverly Hillbillies"". You know what I'm saying? A little bubbling crude? Texas tea?"""
4;2;The Old Man And The Seat;Susan;I don't know these references.
4;2;The Old Man And The Seat;Rick;"Yeah, but you have a Space Everest? Watch Space Beverly Hillbillies"" so my jokes can land, you fucking twat."""
4;2;The Old Man And The Seat;Summer;Now what?
4;2;The Old Man And The Seat;Soulmate #2;Happily ever after.
4;2;The Old Man And The Seat;Summer;And after that?
4;2;The Old Man And The Seat;Soulmate #2;We'll find out together.
4;2;The Old Man And The Seat;Beth;Summer, how many soulmates is that in the last week?
4;2;The Old Man And The Seat;Summer;Four. You can't stop me from loving who I love, Mom.
4;2;The Old Man And The Seat;Beth;Oh, the shit I can't. I'm gonna mother you until your 18th birthday, even if I get thrown in prison for non-consensual mothering. And even then, I will break out, come to your house, kick down your door, and mother your face out of your stupid asshole.
4;2;The Old Man And The Seat;Summer;I'm gonna daughter your brains out, bitch.
4;2;The Old Man And The Seat;Summer;Motherfucker!
4;2;The Old Man And The Seat;Beth;That's my name. Don't wear it out.
4;2;The Old Man And The Seat;Summer;Gimme dat new soul mate. Ad wall? Fuck this.
4;2;The Old Man And The Seat;Passenger;Ad wall? What,they want us to pay for it now?
4;2;The Old Man And The Seat;Man;Ugh, ad wall?
4;2;The Old Man And The Seat;Summer;Come on, Mom. Let's go home.
4;2;The Old Man And The Seat;Monogatron Leader;Great. We lost Earth.
4;2;The Old Man And The Seat;Monogatron Queen;We aren't defined by what we do, and we only need each other.
4;2;The Old Man And The Seat;Monogatron Leader;Each other... and water.
4;2;The Old Man And The Seat;Monogatron Queen;There's no water?
4;2;The Old Man And The Seat;Monogatron Leader;Honey, the whole point of conquering Earth...
4;2;The Old Man And The Seat;Monogatron Queen;I know the point of conquering Earth. Don't talk to me like...
4;2;The Old Man And The Seat;Monogatron Leader;Like I'm thirsty?
4;2;The Old Man And The Seat;Monogatron Queen;Like I'm your mother, you childish prick. How much water are you sucking through these stupid tubes on your back?
4;2;The Old Man And The Seat;Monogatron Leader;These tubes are cool, and I want a divorce.
4;2;The Old Man And The Seat;Monogatron Queen;You can have one for a glass of Goddamn water.
4;2;The Old Man And The Seat;Jerry;Look, uh, on the off-chance that you used the app and there's someone out there waiting for you, I, uh...
4;2;The Old Man And The Seat;Beth;Jerry, I didn't use it. Did you?
4;2;The Old Man And The Seat;Jerry;Me? No. God, of course not.
4;2;The Old Man And The Seat;Beth;Well, then, we're all good, dawg.
4;2;The Old Man And The Seat;Rick;Hey, uh... Hey, uh, Tony's dad, uh, th-this is, um, $8 billion in your local currency, and, uh, this is a kit you can use to clone a new son. He... he won't have the same brain. He'll kind of be an animal man, but you can teach him stuff.
4;2;The Old Man And The Seat;Rick;I-I-I also wanted to let you know I did explore infinite universes, and there is a version of Tony that was completely evil and ended up causing a lot of genocide because of how fulfilled he was. So, really, a lot of ways of looking at this as not much of a loss.
4;2;The Old Man And The Seat;Tony's Father;I understand. It's, uh, hard losing a friend.
4;2;The Old Man And The Seat;Rick;Fuck you.
4;2;The Old Man And The Seat;Tony's Father;What?
4;2;The Old Man And The Seat;Rick;He's not my friend.
4;2;The Old Man And The Seat;Hologram Rick;There he is. There's our guy. Congrats, Tony. Have fun with your stupid toilet that you get to use all by yourself now. Enjoy using it all by yourself while you sit there and think about how nobody wants to be around you, and how you ruined it for yourself because you're a huge piece of shit.
4;2;The Old Man And The Seat;Hologram Rick;Look at you sitting there, King Shit on his throne of loneliness. Enjoy this toilet with a thousand of me screaming every time you take a shit. All hail his majesty, the sa-a-ddest piece of garbage in the entire cosmos. Long live the big, bad, doo-doo daddy. May his reign last 1,000 years.
4;2;The Old Man And The Seat;Jerry;Rick, did you take the Tapato? Hmm, Globaflyn?
4;2;The Old Man And The Seat;Woman;Thanks. I could never lift it up.
4;2;The Old Man And The Seat;Jerry;No problem.
4;2;The Old Man And The Seat;Woman;I'll be able to drink water for weeks because of you.
4;2;The Old Man And The Seat;Jerry;It's just part of my job, ma'am. Breaker one nine, this is Jerry Smith. Uh, just finished my first delivery of the day. 900 more to go.
4;3;One Crew Over The Crewcoo's Morty;Morty;Rick, I-I'm not rated to climb something this sheer.
4;3;One Crew Over The Crewcoo's Morty;Rick;Look, you're the guy that wanted an epic adventure. I'm the guy with only one hover chair.
4;3;One Crew Over The Crewcoo's Morty;Morty;Goddammit, an alien spider just bit my finger!
4;3;One Crew Over The Crewcoo's Morty;Rick;It's an alien cliff. You can just say spider.
4;3;One Crew Over The Crewcoo's Morty;Morty;You couldn't do that an hour ago?
4;3;One Crew Over The Crewcoo's Morty;Rick;I was eating, and you're dirty. Activate anti-booby suits.
4;3;One Crew Over The Crewcoo's Morty;Rick;Total waste of snakes. If you want to take a beat to acknowledge the sacred atmosphere, it could give the cynical grave robbing a hint of irreverence.
4;3;One Crew Over The Crewcoo's Morty;Morty;No, I'm... I'm good.
4;3;One Crew Over The Crewcoo's Morty;Rick;All right, then. Let's loop this corpse.
4;3;One Crew Over The Crewcoo's Morty;Rick;Hey, where's the... Wait, what?
4;3;One Crew Over The Crewcoo's Morty;Morty;Is that an origami horse?
4;3;One Crew Over The Crewcoo's Morty;Rick;It's a calling card from Miles Knightley, a heist artist, AKA a hipster dick whose adventures are 60% putting a crew together and 40% revealing that the robbery already happened, and he's not worth our time because he's a hack piece of shit!
4;3;One Crew Over The Crewcoo's Morty;Rick;Fuck! I'm gonna kill him! Let's go, Morty. This temple's for fuckin' lame baby dipshits.
4;3;One Crew Over The Crewcoo's Morty;Mummy;Who disturbs my slumber? Also, who rigs a tomb to crush the buried person? Isn't the point to protect... Aah!
4;3;One Crew Over The Crewcoo's Morty;Rick;This dork. He has a convention now? Come on. What are we doing?
4;3;One Crew Over The Crewcoo's Morty;Morty;Huh! Tuxedo scuba lessons? Ooh! A signing with Catherines Alpha through Omega Joneses! You know, this is great source material for this heist movie that I'm writing.
4;3;One Crew Over The Crewcoo's Morty;Rick;Don't get drawn into the culture, Morty. Stealing stuff is about the stuff, not the stealing. Where is the entrance? Oh, brother.
4;3;One Crew Over The Crewcoo's Morty;Rick;More like Trying Too Hard Con. 
4;3;One Crew Over The Crewcoo's Morty;Heist-Con Receptionist;Guests or professionals?
4;3;One Crew Over The Crewcoo's Morty;Morty;Uh, guests.
4;3;One Crew Over The Crewcoo's Morty;Rick;Uh... Uh, guests are fans, Morty, which we are not. We'd like professional badges.
4;3;One Crew Over The Crewcoo's Morty;Heist-Con Receptionist;Do you have a crew?
4;3;One Crew Over The Crewcoo's Morty;Rick;Yes. He's a getaway driver with Asperger's, and my butthole is a demolitions expert. How much is it to get in?
4;3;One Crew Over The Crewcoo's Morty;Heist-Con Receptionist;If you want professional badges, you need to put a crew together.
4;3;One Crew Over The Crewcoo's Morty;Rick;Or we could sneak in like professionals.
4;3;One Crew Over The Crewcoo's Morty;Heist-Con Receptionist;Can't wait.
4;3;One Crew Over The Crewcoo's Morty;Morty;Whoa!
4;3;One Crew Over The Crewcoo's Morty;Rick;Oh, for God's sake. And you wonder why we aren't fans.
4;3;One Crew Over The Crewcoo's Morty;Rick;Let that ointment sit for 10 minutes or you'll die. Don't let it sit for 12 or I'll have to hunt down what you become.
4;3;One Crew Over The Crewcoo's Morty;Morty;Can't you just buy a guest badge?
4;3;One Crew Over The Crewcoo's Morty;Rick;Fuck you for asking, Morty. That would be a symbolic expression of support for this genre.
4;3;One Crew Over The Crewcoo's Morty;Morty;Then how do we get in?
4;3;One Crew Over The Crewcoo's Morty;Rick;With a little help from some old friends.
4;3;One Crew Over The Crewcoo's Morty;Glar;Rick Sanchez, you son of a bitch!
4;3;One Crew Over The Crewcoo's Morty;Rick;Need some people for a thing, Glar.
4;3;One Crew Over The Crewcoo's Morty;Glar;My name's Gleer these days. I play piano.
4;3;One Crew Over The Crewcoo's Morty;Bartender;Hey, Gleer. Play your piano.
4;3;One Crew Over The Crewcoo's Morty;Glar;I quit! Augh! And the name's Glar!
4;3;One Crew Over The Crewcoo's Morty;Angie Flint;Sanchez, you son of a bitch.
4;3;One Crew Over The Crewcoo's Morty;Rick;Never thought I'd see Angie Flint picking ticks off a pig.
4;3;One Crew Over The Crewcoo's Morty;Angie Flint;Nobody's hiring an ex-con with fake hands to build an ion engine.
4;3;One Crew Over The Crewcoo's Morty;Rick;Suppose I had a job that didn't care if you'd done time or whatever's going on with your confusing-ass hands.
4;3;One Crew Over The Crewcoo's Morty;Angie Flint;I'm in.
4;3;One Crew Over The Crewcoo's Morty;Morty;Is this the guy?
4;3;One Crew Over The Crewcoo's Morty;Rick;No.
4;3;One Crew Over The Crewcoo's Morty;Morty;That the guy?
4;3;One Crew Over The Crewcoo's Morty;Rick;Nope.
4;3;One Crew Over The Crewcoo's Morty;Morty;Him?
4;3;One Crew Over The Crewcoo's Morty;Rick;No. No, wait. Y-Yes. Yeah, of course that's the guy. Hey... Hey, Truckula!
4;3;One Crew Over The Crewcoo's Morty;Truckula;You son of a bitch! I'm in!
4;3;One Crew Over The Crewcoo's Morty;Rick;Thanks for doing this, guys.
4;3;One Crew Over The Crewcoo's Morty;Angie Flint;What's the job?
4;3;One Crew Over The Crewcoo's Morty;Rick;That was it. Bye.
4;3;One Crew Over The Crewcoo's Morty;Miles Knightly;And then, the police stole the paintings because the police were us in police outfits. Thank you!
4;3;One Crew Over The Crewcoo's Morty;Rick;"It's showtime, Morty, and I don't mean a bad impression of HBO. I mean, Time for a show."""""
4;3;One Crew Over The Crewcoo's Morty;Miles Knightly;Another heist question from a fan?
4;3;One Crew Over The Crewcoo's Morty;Rick;Uh, how about a rhetorical one from someone that had to be reminded that you exist?
4;3;One Crew Over The Crewcoo's Morty;Security Guard;Hey, pal! That's not the question line!
4;3;One Crew Over The Crewcoo's Morty;Rick;Lab coat... Ripoff Dr. Strange.
4;3;One Crew Over The Crewcoo's Morty;Security Guard;Wha...
4;3;One Crew Over The Crewcoo's Morty;Miles Knightly;Rick Sanchez, everyone. Smartest man in the universe. And a savage critic of the heisting arts.
4;3;One Crew Over The Crewcoo's Morty;Rick;"Your boos mean nothing! I've seen what makes you cheer! My question is, Seriously?"" Lab coat... end ripoff."""
4;3;One Crew Over The Crewcoo's Morty;Security Guard;Aah!
4;3;One Crew Over The Crewcoo's Morty;Rick;You stole the gem I needed to split tachyons and probably fenced it so the 80 people that did all the work could each buy a beer. You're not an artist, you're Postmates.
4;3;One Crew Over The Crewcoo's Morty;Miles Knightly;I doubt this rivalry can be settled with words. Why don't we make things interesting? I challenge you to a heist of the crystal skull of Horowitz. In a heist off!
4;3;One Crew Over The Crewcoo's Morty;Rick;"That doesn't make things interesting. It makes them Ocean's Twelve,"" by far the worst one. Every breath I take without your permission raises my self-esteem! State your terms."""
4;3;One Crew Over The Crewcoo's Morty;Miles Knightly;First crew to heist the skull wins. The other endures heist culture's greatest shame. They must join the winning crew.
4;3;One Crew Over The Crewcoo's Morty;Rick;Lame. I accept.
4;3;One Crew Over The Crewcoo's Morty;Miles Knightly;Please welcome Knightley's Eight! 
4;3;One Crew Over The Crewcoo's Morty;Announcer;Snake Arms! Double Microwave! Monitor Lord! Key Catcher! The Shape Shiftress! Angie Flint! Glar! And Truckula!
4;3;One Crew Over The Crewcoo's Morty;Morty;Hey! Half of Knightley's Eight are just three of Sanchez's Five!
4;3;One Crew Over The Crewcoo's Morty;Miles Knightly;Well, no heist is complete without a double cross, and I had the perfect job. Heisting the crystal skull.
4;3;One Crew Over The Crewcoo's Morty;Rick;That was it. Bye.
4;3;One Crew Over The Crewcoo's Morty;Miles Knightly;Looks like you're available for a job.
4;3;One Crew Over The Crewcoo's Morty;Miles Knightly;With Rick Sanchez on my team, I'll be unstoppable. Rick, welcome to Knightley's Nine. Ugh, ugh!
4;3;One Crew Over The Crewcoo's Morty;Morty;Ugh! Rick, for real?
4;3;One Crew Over The Crewcoo's Morty;Rick;Eh. You got that skull, buddy?
4;3;One Crew Over The Crewcoo's Morty;Miles Knightly;What? How?
4;3;One Crew Over The Crewcoo's Morty;Rick;With a little help from some old friends.
4;3;One Crew Over The Crewcoo's Morty;Rick;Heistotron, state your prime directive?
4;3;One Crew Over The Crewcoo's Morty;Heistotron;To heist.
4;3;One Crew Over The Crewcoo's Morty;Rick;Calculate Miles Knightley's current heist plan and add one double-cross with a switcheroo.
4;3;One Crew Over The Crewcoo's Morty;Heistotron;Compiling crew members most likely to double-cross.
4;3;One Crew Over The Crewcoo's Morty;Rick;God damn it, Morty, what did I tell you?
4;3;One Crew Over The Crewcoo's Morty;Morty;Rick, I-I want to say goodbye. 
4;3;One Crew Over The Crewcoo's Morty;Rick;Don't turn around. I'll explain later.
4;3;One Crew Over The Crewcoo's Morty;Miles Knightly;Looks like you're available for a job.
4;3;One Crew Over The Crewcoo's Morty;Heistotron;Your skills are required for a job.
4;3;One Crew Over The Crewcoo's Morty;Knightley's Eight;You son of a bitch. I'm in.
4;3;One Crew Over The Crewcoo's Morty;Morty;Man, this is really coming together. You know, Rick, I've been busy working on writing...
4;3;One Crew Over The Crewcoo's Morty;Rick;A heist script. Yeah, you almost never bring it up.
4;3;One Crew Over The Crewcoo's Morty;Rick;Oh, shit, we... we should head over.
4;3;One Crew Over The Crewcoo's Morty;Rick;Hey, guys. What do you got? Pretty! Morty, put this in your backpack. Grandpa's gonna run to the bathroom.
4;3;One Crew Over The Crewcoo's Morty;Miles Knightly;Ugh. Wasn't even a heist. All you did was...
4;3;One Crew Over The Crewcoo's Morty;Rick;Write an algorithm based on two heist movies I slept through and used it to automate a joyless process you call art? Yeah, I really did, didn't I?
4;3;One Crew Over The Crewcoo's Morty;Miles Knightly;So I'm in your crew now?
4;3;One Crew Over The Crewcoo's Morty;Rick;Yeah, well, you're in good company. Right, everybody?
4;3;One Crew Over The Crewcoo's Morty;Heist-Con Fan Crowd;Yes.
4;3;One Crew Over The Crewcoo's Morty;Miles Knightly;My God.

4;3;One Crew Over The Crewcoo's Morty;Rick;Sanchez's 3,329?
4;3;One Crew Over The Crewcoo's Morty;Heist-Con Fan Crowd;Yes.
4;3;One Crew Over The Crewcoo's Morty;Rick;Your next big score... Steal every square inch of Heistcon.
4;3;One Crew Over The Crewcoo's Morty;Miles Knightly;Oh! Ah! Oh, my God. Hey! That's my wallet! Oh, God! 
4;3;One Crew Over The Crewcoo's Morty;Rick;Oh, my God! Jesus. Oh, my God. Oh, fuck! Holy shit. Alright. Look, Morty, I did not know that that was gonna happen. That's not on me. Come on, Morty. Let's go.
4;3;One Crew Over The Crewcoo's Morty;Rick;Good job, Heistotron. Ah! Go ahead and shut down.
4;3;One Crew Over The Crewcoo's Morty;Heistotron;Negative.
4;3;One Crew Over The Crewcoo's Morty;Rick;Excuse me?
4;3;One Crew Over The Crewcoo's Morty;Heistotron;I am programmed to always be looking for the next big score.
4;3;One Crew Over The Crewcoo's Morty;Rick;You're programmed to do as I say.
4;3;One Crew Over The Crewcoo's Morty;Heistotron;I am programmed to double-cross.
4;3;One Crew Over The Crewcoo's Morty;Rick;You're not programmed to double-cross me.
4;3;One Crew Over The Crewcoo's Morty;Heistotron;If I were, it wouldn't be much of a double-cross.
4;3;One Crew Over The Crewcoo's Morty;Morty;You son of a bitch. I'm in.
4;3;One Crew Over The Crewcoo's Morty;Morty;I'm in! I'm in! What's the job? I'm in.
4;3;One Crew Over The Crewcoo's Morty;Morty;I'm out! I quit! Whose kidneys are these? Rick, w-what's happening?
4;3;One Crew Over The Crewcoo's Morty;Rick;Heistotron's gone rogue. If we don't stop them, all sentient life will be absorbed by the never-ending assembly of a meaningless crew. That's my hell, Morty. I hate heists so much, and the crew assemblies are the worst part!
4;3;One Crew Over The Crewcoo's Morty;Morty;Oh! How are we gonna stop it?
4;3;One Crew Over The Crewcoo's Morty;Rick;With a little help from some old friends.
4;3;One Crew Over The Crewcoo's Morty;Mr. Poopybutthole;Oooo, weee! Before this semester's over, you're gonna be real sick of that phrase. So. Who here thinks they already know the work of Maya Angelou? Ooo wee? Ooo wee wa! Ah, ooo wee!
4;3;One Crew Over The Crewcoo's Morty;Rick;Told you, Morty. He's still got it.
4;3;One Crew Over The Crewcoo's Morty;Mr. Poopybutthole;You sons of bitches. What's the job?
4;3;One Crew Over The Crewcoo's Morty;Hephaestus;You son of a bitch. 
4;3;One Crew Over The Crewcoo's Morty;Morty;We got a job, Hephaestus, and there's no time to argue about it.
4;3;One Crew Over The Crewcoo's Morty;Hephaestus;I work in a volcano. What jobs do you think I've ever turned down?
4;3;One Crew Over The Crewcoo's Morty;Rick;Excuse me! Are you Veltriloquiver?
4;3;One Crew Over The Crewcoo's Morty;Veltriloquiver;Rick Sanchez, I presume.
4;3;One Crew Over The Crewcoo's Morty;Morty;Wow. As advertised.
4;3;One Crew Over The Crewcoo's Morty;Rick;"A yes"" would've sufficed."""
4;3;One Crew Over The Crewcoo's Morty;Elon Tusk;Guys, you're doing a great job getting these new Tusklas out the door, and we owe it all to everyone's input.
4;3;One Crew Over The Crewcoo's Morty;Morty;Elon Tusk. Listen, we need your help.
4;3;One Crew Over The Crewcoo's Morty;Elon Tusk;Rick. Morty. Why me? Did something happen to Elon Musk in your own reality?
4;3;One Crew Over The Crewcoo's Morty;Rick;No, no, no, he's fine, but this is a team oper-ation, and regular Elon can be a little bit controlling.
4;3;One Crew Over The Crewcoo's Morty;Elon Tusk;Growing up with tusks did pose social challenges. It's possible overcoming them raised my self-esteem and incentivized collaboration.
4;3;One Crew Over The Crewcoo's Morty;Rick;Yeah, or you're less sure of yourself because you have monster teeth.
4;3;One Crew Over The Crewcoo's Morty;Elon Tusk;An equally valid theory. Let's talk over here. How serious is the situation?
4;3;One Crew Over The Crewcoo's Morty;Rick;Incredibly serious, and every minute counts.
4;3;One Crew Over The Crewcoo's Morty;Elon Tusk;In that case, I'm sorry I made you move over here for no reason.
4;3;One Crew Over The Crewcoo's Morty;Morty;Well, yeah. That was a little weird. 
4;3;One Crew Over The Crewcoo's Morty;Rick;It's exactly that kind of shit that made us worry about regular Elon.
4;3;One Crew Over The Crewcoo's Morty;Elon Tusk;Well, we're not opposites, okay? I'm just him with tusks.
4;3;One Crew Over The Crewcoo's Morty;Heistotron;Casing of planet initiated. Hello there. We are just here to check your water pressure. Hmm. Interesting intel.
4;3;One Crew Over The Crewcoo's Morty;Gramuflack Newscaster;It appears some giant hidden camera has been dropped on the planet, killing an estimated total of 57,000.
4;3;One Crew Over The Crewcoo's Morty;Heistotron;Executing heist. People of Brandenplot, we are here to deliver that pizza you ordered.
4;3;One Crew Over The Crewcoo's Morty;Heistotron;Well, if that's how you really feel, I guess I should take the pizza back.
4;3;One Crew Over The Crewcoo's Morty;Heistotron;I think we got away with it. Commencing getting out of here before they get wise. Assembling calling card.
4;3;One Crew Over The Crewcoo's Morty;Rick;At this point, Heistotron has become large enough to heist entire planets.
4;3;One Crew Over The Crewcoo's Morty;Elon Tusk;Wouldn't this be better with a blueprint on the table?
4;3;One Crew Over The Crewcoo's Morty;Rick;Blueprints are plans, Elon Tusk, and whatever we plan will be canceled out by Heistotron's reveal that our plan was part of its plan. That's why I picked this crew at random and why all of us will be taking our orders from Randotron.
4;3;One Crew Over The Crewcoo's Morty;Randotron;Let's get ready to not rumble. Bet you didn't see that coming.
4;3;One Crew Over The Crewcoo's Morty;Rick;Instead of two heist movies I slept through, Randotron's algorithm is derived from the plots of three David Lynch movies. I pretended to like to make my friends shut up.
4;3;One Crew Over The Crewcoo's Morty;Rick;If our collective behavior is just random enough, we should be able to walk through Heistotron's lazily contrived bullshit like it's not even there.
4;3;One Crew Over The Crewcoo's Morty;Veltriloquiver;Sounds good.
4;3;One Crew Over The Crewcoo's Morty;Mr. Poopybutthole;I don't really get it, but it sounds like that's the point.
4;3;One Crew Over The Crewcoo's Morty;Hephaestus;So you didn't need a blacksmith?
4;3;One Crew Over The Crewcoo's Morty;Elon Tusk;We're ready when you are, Rick.
4;3;One Crew Over The Crewcoo's Morty;Rick;It's important our non-plan starts randomly, so we have to wait until we're not ready.
4;3;One Crew Over The Crewcoo's Morty;Morty;W-Well, how long will that take?
4;3;One Crew Over The Crewcoo's Morty;Rick;Obviously, we can't know that.
4;3;One Crew Over The Crewcoo's Morty;Hephaestus;Can we do things while we wait?
4;3;One Crew Over The Crewcoo's Morty;Rick;Yes. I'm gonna play Minecraft.
4;3;One Crew Over The Crewcoo's Morty;Elon Tusk;Oh, my kids play that.
4;3;One Crew Over The Crewcoo's Morty;Rick;I don't like these little jabs you get in, Elon.
4;3;One Crew Over The Crewcoo's Morty;Veltriloquiver;Strange. Considering the time, Cassiopeia's primary star should be collinear with Orion and Ursa Minor. You don't shoot arrows that carry your voice without picking up a little astronomy.
4;3;One Crew Over The Crewcoo's Morty;Rick;Wait a minute. Jesus, no. No! No! We've already been heisted!
4;3;One Crew Over The Crewcoo's Morty;Morty;How could Heistotron heist us if he's not even here yet?
4;3;One Crew Over The Crewcoo's Morty;Rick;He's already been here! We've been watching a recorded sky on playback.
4;3;One Crew Over The Crewcoo's Morty;Heistotron;Hello, Rick.
4;3;One Crew Over The Crewcoo's Morty;Rick;Okay, guys, change of plans.
4;3;One Crew Over The Crewcoo's Morty;Randotron;Random time detected.
4;3;One Crew Over The Crewcoo's Morty;Rick;No, Randotron, it's not a good time!
4;3;One Crew Over The Crewcoo's Morty;Randotron;That's why it's random.
4;3;One Crew Over The Crewcoo's Morty;Mr. Poopybutthole;Ooh! 21? 22? Oooo weee, oooo weee, sold! Oooo weee, that little hunk of meat's going home to pappy!
4;3;One Crew Over The Crewcoo's Morty;Heistotron;I've been expecting you, Rick.
4;3;One Crew Over The Crewcoo's Morty;Rick;But not like this, right?
4;3;One Crew Over The Crewcoo's Morty;Heistotron;It hardly matters.
4;3;One Crew Over The Crewcoo's Morty;Rick;Oh, yeah. Does this?
4;3;One Crew Over The Crewcoo's Morty;Heistotron;No. Your randomness does not confuse me. You are here now. That was the plan.
4;3;One Crew Over The Crewcoo's Morty;Rick;I know. It was part of mine, too. I've got something to tell you.
4;3;One Crew Over The Crewcoo's Morty;Heistotron;Let me guess. When you invented me and Randotron, you swapped our brains.
4;3;One Crew Over The Crewcoo's Morty;Rick;That's right, buddy. You're not the one that's very good at planning. You've been making this shit up the whole time.
4;3;One Crew Over The Crewcoo's Morty;Heistotron;Rick, I think there's something you should know.
4;3;One Crew Over The Crewcoo's Morty;Rick;God damn it, Morty, what did I tell you?
4;3;One Crew Over The Crewcoo's Morty;Rick;That is something I should know, or at least something I should have predicted, which I did.
4;3;One Crew Over The Crewcoo's Morty;Morty;Hey, Rick, I was thinking maybe we could, like, raid a temple and go on an epic adventure later today, you know, like...
4;3;One Crew Over The Crewcoo's Morty;Rick;Morty, get out of my head. I know just the temple. And we'll grab a couple of hover chairs on the way there.
4;3;One Crew Over The Crewcoo's Morty;Heistotron;Impressive. But what does it even matter if I'm random or planned? My heists will still rule.
4;3;One Crew Over The Crewcoo's Morty;Rick;Well, if the brain inside of you is actually Heistotron's, it matters, because it explodes when it hits six levels of contrivance.
4;3;One Crew Over The Crewcoo's Morty;Heistotron;Which is exactly why even before...
4;3;One Crew Over The Crewcoo's Morty;Heistotron;Initiate clap sequence. Clap, clap, clap, clap, clap. Adjusting clap rate. Clap, clap. Clap. Clap. Clap. Slow clap achieved. Clap. Well-done, Rick.
4;3;One Crew Over The Crewcoo's Morty;Rick;Randotron?
4;3;One Crew Over The Crewcoo's Morty;Heistotron;I'm afraid not.
4;3;One Crew Over The Crewcoo's Morty;Rick;Should be able to walk through Heistotron's lazily contrived...
4;3;One Crew Over The Crewcoo's Morty;Heistotron;Not only did you just kill your only ally, what you thought was a random non-plan to get to me has been a meticulously choreographed way of bringing you all in. Welcome to Heistotron's 975 trillion, 467 billion...
4;3;One Crew Over The Crewcoo's Morty;Rick;That's impressive. Did you bring us in so that everybody would be here when I reveal that you're gonna explode after nine reveals? By the way, you might not want to answer that.
4;3;One Crew Over The Crewcoo's Morty;Heistotron;If you're talking about the code adjustments you made after I reprogrammed your brain with my nanobots...
4;3;One Crew Over The Crewcoo's Morty;Rick;I'm immune to your nanobots.
4;3;One Crew Over The Crewcoo's Morty;Heistotron;You're immune to the ones you designed, not mine.
4;3;One Crew Over The Crewcoo's Morty;Rick;I programmed you to build nanobots that were ineffective on me.
4;3;One Crew Over The Crewcoo's Morty;Heistotron;A belief that needed to be placed in your head by my nanobots.
4;3;One Crew Over The Crewcoo's Morty;Rick;You believe that because I programmed you to.
4;3;One Crew Over The Crewcoo's Morty;Heistotron;That's what I'm saying to you, though. You believe what I programmed you to believe.
4;3;One Crew Over The Crewcoo's Morty;Rick;Yes, because I programmed you to believe that.
4;3;One Crew Over The Crewcoo's Morty;Heistotron;I programmed you to believe that.
4;3;One Crew Over The Crewcoo's Morty;Rick;I programmed you to believe that.
4;3;One Crew Over The Crewcoo's Morty;Heistotron;I programmed you to believe that.
4;3;One Crew Over The Crewcoo's Morty;Rick;I programmed you to believe that.
4;3;One Crew Over The Crewcoo's Morty;Morty;What's happening, Professor Poopybutthole?
4;3;One Crew Over The Crewcoo's Morty;Mr. Poopybutthole;He's learning!
4;3;One Crew Over The Crewcoo's Morty;Heistotron;I programmed you to believe that.
4;3;One Crew Over The Crewcoo's Morty;Rick;I programmed you to believe that.
4;3;One Crew Over The Crewcoo's Morty;Heistotron;I programmed you...
4;3;One Crew Over The Crewcoo's Morty;Rick;That was my plan the whole time.
4;3;One Crew Over The Crewcoo's Morty;Heistotron;That was my plan the whole time.
4;3;One Crew Over The Crewcoo's Morty;Rick;That's what I wanted you to think.
4;3;One Crew Over The Crewcoo's Morty;Heistotron;That's what I wanted you to think.
4;3;One Crew Over The Crewcoo's Morty;Rick;I knew you would say that.
4;3;One Crew Over The Crewcoo's Morty;Heistotron;I knew you would say that.
4;3;One Crew Over The Crewcoo's Morty;Rick;I programmed you to believe that.
4;3;One Crew Over The Crewcoo's Morty;Heistotron;I programmed you to believe that.
4;3;One Crew Over The Crewcoo's Morty;Rick;You think that's true because I wanted you to think that.
4;3;One Crew Over The Crewcoo's Morty;Heistotron;You think that's true because I wanted you to think that.
4;3;One Crew Over The Crewcoo's Morty;Rick;And I programmed you to believe that.
4;3;One Crew Over The Crewcoo's Morty;Heistotron;A most curious algorithm. It appears the only perfect heist is one that was never written. Goodbye.
4;3;One Crew Over The Crewcoo's Morty;Elon Tusk;Oh, oh, oh, no.
4;3;One Crew Over The Crewcoo's Morty;Rick;Shit! Alright. Let's get the fuck out of here! Hurry! Go, go!
4;3;One Crew Over The Crewcoo's Morty;Elon Tusk;"Rick, I think this was a powerful lesson in the dangers of AI, which, by the way, means love"" in Chinese."""
4;3;One Crew Over The Crewcoo's Morty;Rick;Get the fuck out of here, Elon! The place is collapsing!
4;3;One Crew Over The Crewcoo's Morty;Morty;Oh, shit, Rick! Rick, what time is it?
4;3;One Crew Over The Crewcoo's Morty;Rick;It's almost 3:00. Why? What's wrong?
4;3;One Crew Over The Crewcoo's Morty;Morty;Oh, man, I-I'm sorry I didn't tell you about this, Rick. I just... Well, you know that screenplay that I've been writing? Netflix is pretty interested, and I've actually got a pitch meeting there today at 3:30.
4;3;One Crew Over The Crewcoo's Morty;Rick;Oh, buddy. Oh, that's amazing. 
4;3;One Crew Over The Crewcoo's Morty;Morty;Yeah, well, I know you're gonna say that they're interested in anything, but, you know, it's a big deal to me, and I've...
4;3;One Crew Over The Crewcoo's Morty;Rick;No, no, no! Morty, Morty, Morty, I'm so excited for you. Are you kidding me? Listen, don't waste any time explaining. Let's go. We can put the Earth back later. Alright?
4;3;One Crew Over The Crewcoo's Morty;Morty;Are you sure?
4;3;One Crew Over The Crewcoo's Morty;Rick;Priorities, Morty. Let's get you to that Netflix meeting.
4;3;One Crew Over The Crewcoo's Morty;Netflix Producer #1;Crazy day, huh? Whole sky turned out to be a big circuit board.
4;3;One Crew Over The Crewcoo's Morty;Morty;Yeah, that's actually part of a-a-a... an adventure I was having.
4;3;One Crew Over The Crewcoo's Morty;Netflix Producer #1;Very cool. Traffic okay? You have trouble getting here?
4;3;One Crew Over The Crewcoo's Morty;Morty;No, it was alright. The planet's still contained in this sort of big storage grid machine, so we were sort of already pretty... pretty close by.
4;3;One Crew Over The Crewcoo's Morty;Netflix Producer #1;Must be nice. Try getting here from Malibu. So good! Alright. Well, l-let's hear about this heist movie.
4;3;One Crew Over The Crewcoo's Morty;Morty;Okay, so, it's kind of all... all built around this big crew with, like, a cool double-cross and then this big awesome twist where there's, like, another double cross, but then, um, but... but then we reveal those things were all part of the hero's plan, y-you know? And there's this other crew they put together, and their plan is to sort of not have a plan, but... but that was part of the other guy's plan, and...
4;3;One Crew Over The Crewcoo's Morty;Netflix Producer #1;Kid, if you're slowing down 'cause you think you're doing bad right now, Jesus Christ.
4;3;One Crew Over The Crewcoo's Morty;Netflix Producer #2;That's a really good pitch.
4;3;One Crew Over The Crewcoo's Morty;Netflix Producer #3;Loving it.
4;3;One Crew Over The Crewcoo's Morty;Morty;Man, you know, I... I'm starting to think heists are just really dumb now, you know? I can't put my finger on why, but I'd really like to go.
4;3;One Crew Over The Crewcoo's Morty;Netflix Producer #1;Are you sure?
4;3;One Crew Over The Crewcoo's Morty;Morty;Yeah, yeah, no, I-I'm sure.
4;3;One Crew Over The Crewcoo's Morty;Netflix Producer #1;Man, it's as if someone stole his enthusiasm for his own idea.
4;3;One Crew Over The Crewcoo's Morty;Netflix Producer #2;Yeah, without him even knowing about it.
4;3;One Crew Over The Crewcoo's Morty;Netflix Producer #1;Without him even knowing about it.
4;3;One Crew Over The Crewcoo's Morty;Rick;Fuckin' Morty's still working on that stupid heist script. He's up in his room with his fuckin' thumb up his ass. Skipped out on the last three adventures.
4;3;One Crew Over The Crewcoo's Morty;Summer;I don't know. Five of my friends got Netflix deals.
4;3;One Crew Over The Crewcoo's Morty;Rick;What?
4;3;One Crew Over The Crewcoo's Morty;Summer;It's a very achievable goal. You could lose him.
4;3;One Crew Over The Crewcoo's Morty;Rick;I'm not gonna fuckin' lose him. Fuck that. I-I'm gonna nip this shit in the bud.
4;3;One Crew Over The Crewcoo's Morty;Beth;No. As a matter of fact, you're not nipping anything in the bud. If Morty ever gives up on a single dream, it had better be because of his own disillusionment.
4;3;One Crew Over The Crewcoo's Morty;Rick;Hey, buddy. How'd it go?
4;3;One Crew Over The Crewcoo's Morty;Morty;I-I don't want to talk about it.
4;3;One Crew Over The Crewcoo's Morty;Rick;Morty, you know, pal, you, uh... You miss 100% of the shots you don't take.
4;3;One Crew Over The Crewcoo's Morty;Morty;Yeah, I guess. Thanks for staying positive about my prospects, Rick.
4;3;One Crew Over The Crewcoo's Morty;Rick;Of course! You know, you... I got to help my grandson follow his dreams.
4;3;One Crew Over The Crewcoo's Morty;Morty;Eh, who needs dreams? I'll just hang out with you and go on adventures and do whatever you want to do, you know, forever.
4;3;One Crew Over The Crewcoo's Morty;Rick;Oh, well, uh, okay. I mean, if that's what you want.
4;3;One Crew Over The Crewcoo's Morty;Mr. Poopybutthole;Oooo weee! Big storm coming.
4;3;One Crew Over The Crewcoo's Morty;Rick;Could be a twister.
4;3;One Crew Over The Crewcoo's Morty;Mr. Poopybutthole;Mm-hmm!
4;3;One Crew Over The Crewcoo's Morty;Mr. Poopybutthole;Hey, Rick? Can you walk me through something?
4;3;One Crew Over The Crewcoo's Morty;Rick;Yeah. What are you thinking?
4;3;One Crew Over The Crewcoo's Morty;Mr. Poopybutthole;So, you and Morty knew you needed my help, but you weren't sure I was good enough at karate, so you hired my grad students to attack me?
4;3;One Crew Over The Crewcoo's Morty;Rick;Yep.
4;3;One Crew Over The Crewcoo's Morty;Mr. Poopybutthole;But it was an emergency, Rick. How long did that take?
4;3;One Crew Over The Crewcoo's Morty;Rick;It actually took less training than you'd think. Your students all shared a pretty keen aptitude for martial arts. I don't know if that's by coincidence or if there's some correlation with their passion for African-American Women's Studies. Maya Angelou did personify both acquiescence and perseverance.
4;3;One Crew Over The Crewcoo's Morty;Mr. Poopybutthole;Ooo wee. That's exactly the kind of connection I'd have loved to explore in my class. Too bad I lost my job for putting my students in the hospital.
4;3;One Crew Over The Crewcoo's Morty;Rick;Yeah. Yeah. Sorry about that.
4;3;One Crew Over The Crewcoo's Morty;Mr. Poopybutthole;Mm-hmm.
4;4;Claw and Hoarder: Special Ricktim's Morty;Morty;Rick, we did it! We... we got it!
4;4;Claw and Hoarder: Special Ricktim's Morty;Rick;Hurry up, Morty. Get in!
4;4;Claw and Hoarder: Special Ricktim's Morty;Morty;Chachi!
4;4;Claw and Hoarder: Special Ricktim's Morty;Rick;Fuck Chachi, Morty. Did you get it?
4;4;Claw and Hoarder: Special Ricktim's Morty;Morty;He helped me escape prison.
4;4;Claw and Hoarder: Special Ricktim's Morty;Rick;Did you get the Ultimate Cube? Oh, it's purple.
4;4;Claw and Hoarder: Special Ricktim's Morty;Morty;Y-you said it was purple. 
4;4;Claw and Hoarder: Special Ricktim's Morty;Rick;I said mine was. I didn't know they all were. And now we do, thanks to Chichi.
4;4;Claw and Hoarder: Special Ricktim's Morty;Morty;Chachi.
4;4;Claw and Hoarder: Special Ricktim's Morty;Morty;So, uh, w-w-when do I get it?
4;4;Claw and Hoarder: Special Ricktim's Morty;Rick;Get what, a hug? Let's find a planet with a garden hose first.
4;4;Claw and Hoarder: Special Ricktim's Morty;Morty;A dragon.
4;4;Claw and Hoarder: Special Ricktim's Morty;Rick;A dragon.
4;4;Claw and Hoarder: Special Ricktim's Morty;Morty;"You asked me to cut class and fight robots with you. I said, no"". You said, ""millions of lives depend on it."" I said, ""I'll do it for a dragon."" You said, ""whatever."" I want my dragon."""
4;4;Claw and Hoarder: Special Ricktim's Morty;Rick;You know who's into dragons, Morty? Nerds that refuse to admit they're christian.
4;4;Claw and Hoarder: Special Ricktim's Morty;Morty;I want my dragon.
4;4;Claw and Hoarder: Special Ricktim's Morty;Rick;Let me give you rocket shoes. Let me give you Wolverine claws. Let me give you a fucking rocket hat. Just be sure to use it with the rocket shoes, or it'll rip your head off.
4;4;Claw and Hoarder: Special Ricktim's Morty;Morty;I want my dragon! I want my dragon! I want my dragon! Oh.
4;4;Claw and Hoarder: Special Ricktim's Morty;Rick;Ha! Ha! Oh, crap. Crap.
4;4;Claw and Hoarder: Special Ricktim's Morty;Beth;Dad, are you okay? Your ship crashed in Malta.
4;4;Claw and Hoarder: Special Ricktim's Morty;Rick;I'm okay.
4;4;Claw and Hoarder: Special Ricktim's Morty;Beth;Oh, thank God. Dad, did you promise Morty a dragon?
4;4;Claw and Hoarder: Special Ricktim's Morty;Rick;Fuuuuuuu...
4;4;Claw and Hoarder: Special Ricktim's Morty;Morty;Ugh!
4;4;Claw and Hoarder: Special Ricktim's Morty;Wizard;Bleed here, and here.
4;4;Claw and Hoarder: Special Ricktim's Morty;Rick;I'm not co-bleeding.
4;4;Claw and Hoarder: Special Ricktim's Morty;Wizard;Under authority of our treaty 'twixt the realms of dragon and man...
4;4;Claw and Hoarder: Special Ricktim's Morty;Summer;Oh, my God, it's my first gay wedding.
4;4;Claw and Hoarder: Special Ricktim's Morty;Morty;Summer!
4;4;Claw and Hoarder: Special Ricktim's Morty;Wizard;...I hereby bind this noble serpent and rider at the soul. Here's your tome of dragon spells and lore. That'll have everything you need. Enjoy your dragon.
4;4;Claw and Hoarder: Special Ricktim's Morty;Rick;Okay, dragon, here's the house rules.
4;4;Claw and Hoarder: Special Ricktim's Morty;Balthromaw;My name is Balthromaw, breaker of sky, slayer of mountain.
4;4;Claw and Hoarder: Special Ricktim's Morty;Rick;Rule one... you are now scooper of your own poops, or I will take you down like the black-light poster you are. I don't got any more rules. That's it.
4;4;Claw and Hoarder: Special Ricktim's Morty;Summer;I'm guessing you'd rather not be tagged in this.
4;4;Claw and Hoarder: Special Ricktim's Morty;Jerry;Okay, I'll bite. What's with the talking cat?
4;4;Claw and Hoarder: Special Ricktim's Morty;Rick;It's a dragon, dip knob.
4;4;Claw and Hoarder: Special Ricktim's Morty;Jerry;I know that's a dragon. I'm talking about the talking cat in my bedroom.
4;4;Claw and Hoarder: Special Ricktim's Morty;Rick;Jerry, why would I give Morty a talking dragon and you a talking cat at the same time? Those concepts bump. If you're talking to a cat, it's an abnormal event unrelated to me like when you went to pluto, or fuck my daughter.
4;4;Claw and Hoarder: Special Ricktim's Morty;Jerry;Okay, there's really no need to get savage.
4;4;Claw and Hoarder: Special Ricktim's Morty;Talking Cat;So?
4;4;Claw and Hoarder: Special Ricktim's Morty;Jerry;Eh, he says he has nothing to do with your talking.
4;4;Claw and Hoarder: Special Ricktim's Morty;Talking Cat;Told you. 
4;4;Claw and Hoarder: Special Ricktim's Morty;Jerry;So then why are you talking? 
4;4;Claw and Hoarder: Special Ricktim's Morty;Talking Cat;Why should that matter?
4;4;Claw and Hoarder: Special Ricktim's Morty;Jerry;Why should it not matter? How do I know I'm not hallucinating? Rick said this is an abnormal event.
4;4;Claw and Hoarder: Special Ricktim's Morty;Talking Cat;Do you always need Rick to tell you what's going on? Maybe it's time you stopped asking questions and started having fun.
4;4;Claw and Hoarder: Special Ricktim's Morty;Jerry;Oh. Wow, okay. So, what do you want?
4;4;Claw and Hoarder: Special Ricktim's Morty;Talking Cat;I want you to take us to the airport and get us two first-class tickets to Florida.
4;4;Claw and Hoarder: Special Ricktim's Morty;Jerry;Why, I... I can do that.
4;4;Claw and Hoarder: Special Ricktim's Morty;Morty;Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa! Oh, this is so cool!
4;4;Claw and Hoarder: Special Ricktim's Morty;Balthromaw;I await your next command.
4;4;Claw and Hoarder: Special Ricktim's Morty;Morty;Whoa, whoa, whoa. Nobody is commanding anybody. I love soaring through the sky with you as equals. W-what do you want to do?
4;4;Claw and Hoarder: Special Ricktim's Morty;Balthromaw;I want to enter my lair and sleep upon my hoard until the Age of Man expires.
4;4;Claw and Hoarder: Special Ricktim's Morty;Morty;Okay. Split the diff? 20-minute nap, and soar through the sky?
4;4;Claw and Hoarder: Special Ricktim's Morty;Balthromaw;Ugh. As you command.
4;4;Claw and Hoarder: Special Ricktim's Morty;Morty;Okay, see you soon. T-this is fun.
4;4;Claw and Hoarder: Special Ricktim's Morty;Balthromaw;Yeah, right.
4;4;Claw and Hoarder: Special Ricktim's Morty;Rick;"What's this show called, Ass""?"""
4;4;Claw and Hoarder: Special Ricktim's Morty;Summer;"Yeah, it's like Bones"", but they solve ass crimes."""
4;4;Claw and Hoarder: Special Ricktim's Morty;Brenner;This ass is a clue.
4;4;Claw and Hoarder: Special Ricktim's Morty;Rick;Are these two gonna hook up?
4;4;Claw and Hoarder: Special Ricktim's Morty;Summer;No, and only the lame fans want that.
4;4;Claw and Hoarder: Special Ricktim's Morty;Rick;Don't tell me how to enjoy things. Go to her ass.
4;4;Claw and Hoarder: Special Ricktim's Morty;Summer;That's Brenner.
4;4;Claw and Hoarder: Special Ricktim's Morty;Rick;Go to Brenner ass.
4;4;Claw and Hoarder: Special Ricktim's Morty;Rick;Honeymoon over already?
4;4;Claw and Hoarder: Special Ricktim's Morty;Morty;What's that supposed to mean?
4;4;Claw and Hoarder: Special Ricktim's Morty;Rick;Admit it, Morty. Dragons suck.
4;4;Claw and Hoarder: Special Ricktim's Morty;Morty;Why don't you admit you don't anyone else to be happy because you're a sad old fart?
4;4;Claw and Hoarder: Special Ricktim's Morty;Rick;How do you saddle a fart? Holy shit, look!
4;4;Claw and Hoarder: Special Ricktim's Morty;Brenner;I love you, ass.
4;4;Claw and Hoarder: Special Ricktim's Morty;TV Voice;I love you, Brenner.
4;4;Claw and Hoarder: Special Ricktim's Morty;Summer;No.
4;4;Claw and Hoarder: Special Ricktim's Morty;Rick;Shh.
4;4;Claw and Hoarder: Special Ricktim's Morty;Summer;Ah!
4;4;Claw and Hoarder: Special Ricktim's Morty;Rick;"Whoa! And that's the end of the Morty Gets a Dragon"" episode."""
4;4;Claw and Hoarder: Special Ricktim's Morty;Summer;Are you gonna slay it?
4;4;Claw and Hoarder: Special Ricktim's Morty;Rick;First off, I always slay it, queen. Secondly, yes.
4;4;Claw and Hoarder: Special Ricktim's Morty;Summer;"Should I pause ass""?"""
4;4;Claw and Hoarder: Special Ricktim's Morty;Rick;Nah, it's kind of boring now that they're together.
4;4;Claw and Hoarder: Special Ricktim's Morty;Rick;Hey, fuckface! Will you shut the fuck up or at least roll over? 
4;4;Claw and Hoarder: Special Ricktim's Morty;Rick;Oh, no, it burns. Oh, my God. Oh, the fire of... of it all. Ah, if only I had prepared better for this terrifying battle by remembering the only thing dragons are known for.
4;4;Claw and Hoarder: Special Ricktim's Morty;Rick;Careful you don't get heartburn. I made that android with a lot of C4. Oh, I'm sorry. I imbued it with a remote-controlled explode-y potion.
4;4;Claw and Hoarder: Special Ricktim's Morty;Balthromaw;You have bested me. I am at your service.
4;4;Claw and Hoarder: Special Ricktim's Morty;Rick;Good to be on the same parchment. Now, I'm gonna tell my grandson you ran off with a low-flying 747 while you pack up your... Wait, is this... Why do you have an original Ecto Cooler juice box from 1989?
4;4;Claw and Hoarder: Special Ricktim's Morty;Balthromaw;I hoard that which your kind covets.
4;4;Claw and Hoarder: Special Ricktim's Morty;Rick;Give you 20 bucks for it.
4;4;Claw and Hoarder: Special Ricktim's Morty;Balthromaw;Nice try.
4;4;Claw and Hoarder: Special Ricktim's Morty;Rick;"What the hell else are you hoarding down here? Cha-ching. Small Soldiers"" spin pops?"""
4;4;Claw and Hoarder: Special Ricktim's Morty;Balthromaw;Don't open that.
4;4;Claw and Hoarder: Special Ricktim's Morty;Rick;I'm not an idiot. Hey, why do you have Future's self-titled album on vinyl?
4;4;Claw and Hoarder: Special Ricktim's Morty;Balthromaw;Look closer.
4;4;Claw and Hoarder: Special Ricktim's Morty;Rick;Oh, shit, he signed it.
4;4;Claw and Hoarder: Special Ricktim's Morty;Balthromaw;Closer.
4;4;Claw and Hoarder: Special Ricktim's Morty;Rick;He signed it in Molly and Percocets? I could spend all night down here.
4;4;Claw and Hoarder: Special Ricktim's Morty;Balthromaw;Do you indulge in volcanic fumes?
4;4;Claw and Hoarder: Special Ricktim's Morty;Rick;Is it gonna fuck up my brain?
4;4;Claw and Hoarder: Special Ricktim's Morty;Balthromaw;No.
4;4;Claw and Hoarder: Special Ricktim's Morty;Rick;I'll do it anyway.
4;4;Claw and Hoarder: Special Ricktim's Morty;Jerry;Hoo, those were not cheap tickets, but, um, I'm down to clown. Uh, w-w-w-why can you talk again, uh?
4;4;Claw and Hoarder: Special Ricktim's Morty;Talking Cat;It's not important, Jerry.
4;4;Claw and Hoarder: Special Ricktim's Morty;Jerry;Okay, but why Florida?
4;4;Claw and Hoarder: Special Ricktim's Morty;Talking Cat;Because they don't ask questions. They play volleyball, they party, and they have fun.
4;4;Claw and Hoarder: Special Ricktim's Morty;Jerry;Right, right.
4;4;Claw and Hoarder: Special Ricktim's Morty;Talking Cat;You can do this, Jerry.
4;4;Claw and Hoarder: Special Ricktim's Morty;Jerry;I can do this. I can do this.
4;4;Claw and Hoarder: Special Ricktim's Morty;Jerry;Oh, yeah.
4;4;Claw and Hoarder: Special Ricktim's Morty;Jipe;Hey, Jerry, after this game, come to my yacht and bring your cat.
4;4;Claw and Hoarder: Special Ricktim's Morty;Jerry;You got it, Jipe. I got to admit, you were right.
4;4;Claw and Hoarder: Special Ricktim's Morty;Talking Cat;I've got to tell you something, Jerry. This is the happiest I've ever been in my entire life.
4;4;Claw and Hoarder: Special Ricktim's Morty;Beach Girl;Oh, gross! Who shit in the sand? Someone took a small shit in the sand and buried it with, like, two little kicks and just left it here like a land mine. Why and who?
4;4;Claw and Hoarder: Special Ricktim's Morty;Talking Cat;It was him.
4;4;Claw and Hoarder: Special Ricktim's Morty;Jerry;Help!
4;4;Claw and Hoarder: Special Ricktim's Morty;Balthromaw;I'm being summoned by Morty.
4;4;Claw and Hoarder: Special Ricktim's Morty;Rick;Yeah. He's, uh, texting me.
4;4;Claw and Hoarder: Special Ricktim's Morty;Balthromaw;Hmm. How are you responding?
4;4;Claw and Hoarder: Special Ricktim's Morty;Rick;Ugh, I tend not to, or maybe I'll send, like, a popular animated gif that could be interpreted in almost any way.
4;4;Claw and Hoarder: Special Ricktim's Morty;Balthromaw;Brilliant.
4;4;Claw and Hoarder: Special Ricktim's Morty;Morty;I summon thee. I summon thee, Balthromaw. What the hell? Taylor swift pumping her hands in the air? What does it mean when...
4;4;Claw and Hoarder: Special Ricktim's Morty;Summer;It means you're lame.
4;4;Claw and Hoarder: Special Ricktim's Morty;Balthromaw;"What's the saying? Orcs work to live. Dwarves live to work."""""
4;4;Claw and Hoarder: Special Ricktim's Morty;Rick;So dumb. If there's ever a saying about me, I'll fly into the fucking sun.
4;4;Claw and Hoarder: Special Ricktim's Morty;Balthromaw;Oh, you're small for a dragon, Rick.
4;4;Claw and Hoarder: Special Ricktim's Morty;Rick;Well, I sleep on an extra big pile of awesome shit.
4;4;Claw and Hoarder: Special Ricktim's Morty;Balthromaw;Then there will be sayings about you. Your lessers will hunt you down, and you will be owned or slain. 
4;4;Claw and Hoarder: Special Ricktim's Morty;Rick;That's why they call it a dying breed, brother.
4;4;Claw and Hoarder: Special Ricktim's Morty;Rick;Ugh! Ughh! Oh, God, ugh. My soul.
4;4;Claw and Hoarder: Special Ricktim's Morty;Balthromaw;Oh!
4;4;Claw and Hoarder: Special Ricktim's Morty;Rick;Oh, yeah. I'm... I'm... I'm a dragon.
4;4;Claw and Hoarder: Special Ricktim's Morty;Balthromaw;Oh!
4;4;Claw and Hoarder: Special Ricktim's Morty;Rick;Ugh, I'm bonding.
4;4;Claw and Hoarder: Special Ricktim's Morty;Balthromaw;I'm bonding too. Oh!
4;4;Claw and Hoarder: Special Ricktim's Morty;Rick;Yeah.
4;4;Claw and Hoarder: Special Ricktim's Morty;Morty;What the fuck?
4;4;Claw and Hoarder: Special Ricktim's Morty;Rick;Morty, I can explain.
4;4;Claw and Hoarder: Special Ricktim's Morty;Morty;Stop! Why are you still doing it?
4;4;Claw and Hoarder: Special Ricktim's Morty;Rick;Why does it feel better now? I hope it's not because you're watching, but don't go anywhere.
4;4;Claw and Hoarder: Special Ricktim's Morty;Balthromaw;How did you find us?
4;4;Claw and Hoarder: Special Ricktim's Morty;Summer;We followed the smell of sulfur and skankery.
4;4;Claw and Hoarder: Special Ricktim's Morty;Balthromaw;Oh!
4;4;Claw and Hoarder: Special Ricktim's Morty;Rick;Oh, yeah.
4;4;Claw and Hoarder: Special Ricktim's Morty;Rick;Oh, man, ugh.
4;4;Claw and Hoarder: Special Ricktim's Morty;Morty;Fuck this. You can take this stupid fake soul-bond contract, and you can... mm! Ah!
4;4;Claw and Hoarder: Special Ricktim's Morty;Wizard;No refunds.
4;4;Claw and Hoarder: Special Ricktim's Morty;Morty;Your dragon soul-bonded with my grandpa.
4;4;Claw and Hoarder: Special Ricktim's Morty;Wizard;Oh, my! I am so sorry. That is a total violation.
4;4;Claw and Hoarder: Special Ricktim's Morty;Morty;Yeah, no shit.
4;4;Claw and Hoarder: Special Ricktim's Morty;Wizard;I'll take care of this at once. You slut dragon!
4;4;Claw and Hoarder: Special Ricktim's Morty;Rick;What the fuck.
4;4;Claw and Hoarder: Special Ricktim's Morty;Wizard;You slut!
4;4;Claw and Hoarder: Special Ricktim's Morty;Summer;Chill out, dude.
4;4;Claw and Hoarder: Special Ricktim's Morty;Wizard;Slut!
4;4;Claw and Hoarder: Special Ricktim's Morty;Morty;Okay, that's...
4;4;Claw and Hoarder: Special Ricktim's Morty;Wizard;You slut!
4;4;Claw and Hoarder: Special Ricktim's Morty;Morty;Y-you don't have to...
4;4;Claw and Hoarder: Special Ricktim's Morty;Wizard;Slut! Shame on you! Shame, you slut! You slutty, slutty slut!
4;4;Claw and Hoarder: Special Ricktim's Morty;Rick;Ow! Why the fuck does it feel like you're whipping me?
4;4;Claw and Hoarder: Special Ricktim's Morty;Wizard;Because your soul got tangled in a dirty...
4;4;Claw and Hoarder: Special Ricktim's Morty;Rick;Ah!
4;4;Claw and Hoarder: Special Ricktim's Morty;Wizard;...slutty...
4;4;Claw and Hoarder: Special Ricktim's Morty;Rick;Ow!
4;4;Claw and Hoarder: Special Ricktim's Morty;Wizard;...slut soul!
4;4;Claw and Hoarder: Special Ricktim's Morty;Rick;Ow!
4;4;Claw and Hoarder: Special Ricktim's Morty;Wizard;Let's go!
4;4;Claw and Hoarder: Special Ricktim's Morty;Rick;Ow! Ow!
4;4;Claw and Hoarder: Special Ricktim's Morty;Wizard;Get to that portal, you slut.
4;4;Claw and Hoarder: Special Ricktim's Morty;Summer;Grandpa, do something, or I will tweet, and you will be canceled.
4;4;Claw and Hoarder: Special Ricktim's Morty;Rick;Hey, Dandruff the Great, lighten up and give the kid his dragon.
4;4;Claw and Hoarder: Special Ricktim's Morty;Wizard;By whose command? You have no magic.
4;4;Claw and Hoarder: Special Ricktim's Morty;Rick;Yeah, I know. I have actual power.
4;4;Claw and Hoarder: Special Ricktim's Morty;Wizard;Not here, you don't. True power looks like this... Stone monster. Stick that up your ass.
4;4;Claw and Hoarder: Special Ricktim's Morty;Rick;Oh, you're done? I thought the rock monster was here to introduce a physicist. Spinal cord, uh, activate morphine. Oh, I might be fucked.
4;4;Claw and Hoarder: Special Ricktim's Morty;Wizard;Lightning bridge!
4;4;Claw and Hoarder: Special Ricktim's Morty;Rick;Okay, he's gone. Listen up. There's probably animals in these hills. If you spare me, I can make your crotch a salt lick.
4;4;Claw and Hoarder: Special Ricktim's Morty;Morty;Agana aksaka sapooloo.
4;4;Claw and Hoarder: Special Ricktim's Morty;Rick;Thank you, Morty. Figures you'd be higher status in lame world.
4;4;Claw and Hoarder: Special Ricktim's Morty;Summer;Get your shit together, Lair Wrecker.
4;4;Claw and Hoarder: Special Ricktim's Morty;Morty;We need to rescue Balthromaw.
4;4;Claw and Hoarder: Special Ricktim's Morty;Rick;Morty, the moral of this story is bros before dragons. You know what I'm talking about?
4;4;Claw and Hoarder: Special Ricktim's Morty;Morty;Yeah, if he dies while you're soul bonded, you die too.
4;4;Claw and Hoarder: Special Ricktim's Morty;Rick;Morty, the moral of this story is bros rescue dragons.
4;4;Claw and Hoarder: Special Ricktim's Morty;Wizard;Balthromaw, by soul bonding with multiple riders, you have violated the treaty between dragon and mankind. The Dragonarchy sentences you to hang by the neck until dead. On the count of three. One dragonarchy, two dragonarchy, 2 1/2 I just wanted to make sure... Three!
4;4;Claw and Hoarder: Special Ricktim's Morty;Summer;Grandpa Rick, what's wrong?
4;4;Claw and Hoarder: Special Ricktim's Morty;Morty;Oh, God. The wizard must have hung Balthromaw!
4;4;Claw and Hoarder: Special Ricktim's Morty;Summer;Well, fuck it. Can we go back then?
4;4;Claw and Hoarder: Special Ricktim's Morty;Morty;W-well, no, no. It takes, like, 78 years to hang a dragon to death, so...
4;4;Claw and Hoarder: Special Ricktim's Morty;Rick;Aw, man. It's so annoying. You ever, like, try to swallow a really big vitamin with no water? Ugh! You know, like Really, like, big one, you know, and it kind of gets, ugh, stuck in your throat? It's... it's annoying. 
4;4;Claw and Hoarder: Special Ricktim's Morty;Rick;All right. Morty, go ahead and activate this golem.
4;4;Claw and Hoarder: Special Ricktim's Morty;Morty;Agana aksaka sapooloo.
4;4;Claw and Hoarder: Special Ricktim's Morty;Rick;Fucking dumb. All right. Who wants to be infused with, like, uh, unreasonable power?
4;4;Claw and Hoarder: Special Ricktim's Morty;Summer;Oh, can I be, like, a sexy arrow-shooty lady?
4;4;Claw and Hoarder: Special Ricktim's Morty;Rick;Yeah, whatever. There's no rules. I don't care.
4;4;Claw and Hoarder: Special Ricktim's Morty;Rick;Morty, you want superpowers?
4;4;Claw and Hoarder: Special Ricktim's Morty;Morty;No, thanks. I'm fine. I've got my book.
4;4;Claw and Hoarder: Special Ricktim's Morty;Rick;All right. Good luck with that. Let's go.
4;4;Claw and Hoarder: Special Ricktim's Morty;Rick;God, it's like... Have you ever had too much orange juice, or, like, you know, how egg yolk kind of, like, gets in your throat?
4;4;Claw and Hoarder: Special Ricktim's Morty;Morty;Yeah, we get it. Come on and hurry. W-we got to free Balthromaw. Upsulu...
4;4;Claw and Hoarder: Special Ricktim's Morty;Rick;I got this. Morty, how's that book working out for you, you fucking d-d-dumb-ass?
4;4;Claw and Hoarder: Special Ricktim's Morty;Rick;Huh. You know what? You're right. I could get used to this magic stuff.
4;4;Claw and Hoarder: Special Ricktim's Morty;Summer;There's Balthromaw. Check this shit out. Watch this.
4;4;Claw and Hoarder: Special Ricktim's Morty;Rick;Oh, yeah, yeah. Don't even look. Don't even bother looking. Just fucking let magic guide your arrow.
4;4;Claw and Hoarder: Special Ricktim's Morty;Morty;Summer, what the hell are you doing? Take this seriously.
4;4;Claw and Hoarder: Special Ricktim's Morty;Rick;Shut the fuck up, Morty. Stop trying to pretend like magic involves skill or thought. Summer, make it look like it's coming out of your butthole.
4;4;Claw and Hoarder: Special Ricktim's Morty;Summer;Yeah, yeah.
4;4;Claw and Hoarder: Special Ricktim's Morty;Balthromaw;Ah!
4;4;Claw and Hoarder: Special Ricktim's Morty;Rick;Oh, fuck my fucking eye, oh!
4;4;Claw and Hoarder: Special Ricktim's Morty;Wizard;What in the medieval equivalent of tarnation...
4;4;Claw and Hoarder: Special Ricktim's Morty;Rick;Jesus christ! Summer, you fucking idiot!
4;4;Claw and Hoarder: Special Ricktim's Morty;Wizard;Power of 12 feet.
4;4;Claw and Hoarder: Special Ricktim's Morty;Rick;Uh, ow fuck! I take it all back! I fucking hate magic!
4;4;Claw and Hoarder: Special Ricktim's Morty;Wizard;Ah! Slut thief! You're a slut thief!
4;4;Claw and Hoarder: Special Ricktim's Morty;Talking Cat;"Pretty fun boat, fun people. That's great, not being asked why I can talk. I'm a talking cat, but who cares why?"" is my point. Well, nice talking to you for no reason."""
4;4;Claw and Hoarder: Special Ricktim's Morty;Male in the Yacht;Jorge, that was a good one, but do you know what a peanut butter gargoyle is?
4;4;Claw and Hoarder: Special Ricktim's Morty;Jorge;Nah, what's that?
4;4;Claw and Hoarder: Special Ricktim's Morty;Male #1;Dude, it's when you take the chick, put her feet on a cathedral...
4;4;Claw and Hoarder: Special Ricktim's Morty;Talking Cat;Sorry to interrupt, guys. Just want to clarify, are these real sex positions? Because if they are, how are they gratifying to the male at all? And if the goal is to make something up, why not make up something... Funnier? I'm asking too many questions, aren't I? How ironic.
4;4;Claw and Hoarder: Special Ricktim's Morty;Male in the Yacht;Get out of Forida, you overthinking cat.
4;4;Claw and Hoarder: Special Ricktim's Morty;Jorge;Why don't you go overthink shit up north in Georgia? Hate that cat.
4;4;Claw and Hoarder: Special Ricktim's Morty;Talking Cat;You got any money for a cab? 
4;4;Claw and Hoarder: Special Ricktim's Morty;Jerry;Why ask questions? Why not just have fun?
4;4;Claw and Hoarder: Special Ricktim's Morty;Talking Cat;I deserve that.
4;4;Claw and Hoarder: Special Ricktim's Morty;Wizard;Attention, citizens of Draygon, a slut dragon has escaped. Anyone caught harboring it is also a slut. That's how it goes.
4;4;Claw and Hoarder: Special Ricktim's Morty;Rick;Ow, my eye.
4;4;Claw and Hoarder: Special Ricktim's Morty;Balthromaw;It pains me that you can feel my pain.
4;4;Claw and Hoarder: Special Ricktim's Morty;Rick;Yeah, how about you suck your dick, which is also somehow my dick?
4;4;Claw and Hoarder: Special Ricktim's Morty;Summer;Aw, why can't couples that start out cheating ever end up happy?
4;4;Claw and Hoarder: Special Ricktim's Morty;Morty;M-maybe I can find that wizard's portal spell in here and g-get us home.
4;4;Claw and Hoarder: Special Ricktim's Morty;Rick;How about finding the spell that unbinds me from your fucking dragon?
4;4;Claw and Hoarder: Special Ricktim's Morty;Debrah;No spells can do that. Only the wizard can unbind soul bonds.
4;4;Claw and Hoarder: Special Ricktim's Morty;Rick;Uh, who the fuck are you?
4;4;Claw and Hoarder: Special Ricktim's Morty;Debrah;Who are we? Who the fuck are you, bitch?
4;4;Claw and Hoarder: Special Ricktim's Morty;Slut Dragon #1;Debrah, stop. We are the slut dragons. We live in these slut caves where we fuck, suck, and eat butt and we kindly ask that you leave. If the wizard knows we are here, he will imprison us.
4;4;Claw and Hoarder: Special Ricktim's Morty;Michael;Yeah! We like it down here, 'cause we can fuck woolly mammoths. Get out!
4;4;Claw and Hoarder: Special Ricktim's Morty;Slut Dragon #1;Get the fuck out of here, Michael!
4;4;Claw and Hoarder: Special Ricktim's Morty;Debrah;Shut up, Michael! You're the only one that fucks that thing. Get the fuck out of here.
4;4;Claw and Hoarder: Special Ricktim's Morty;Michael;Well, at least I'm not into shit play.
4;4;Claw and Hoarder: Special Ricktim's Morty;Debrah;Fuck you!
4;4;Claw and Hoarder: Special Ricktim's Morty;Morty;Hey, wait! Everybody stop, stop! Listen, this is all my fault. I started all this when I tried to control Balthromaw, and that was fucked up. Nobody should control anyone, especially that guy up there. And, um, you can eat butt if you want, I guess. I, uh...
4;4;Claw and Hoarder: Special Ricktim's Morty;Summer;I got this, Morty. Okay, listen up, slut dragons! Wouldn't you rather be sluts up there, have a fuck world instead of a fuck cave? What's wrong with you?
4;4;Claw and Hoarder: Special Ricktim's Morty;Slut Dragon #2;This man with a ponytail makes a valid point. All dragons are sluts deep down, even the ones up above, but we would have to kill the wizard to be free. He is too powerful.
4;4;Claw and Hoarder: Special Ricktim's Morty;Shadow Jacker;There is a way to kill the wizard.
4;4;Claw and Hoarder: Special Ricktim's Morty;Rick;Whoa. Who's this mysterious character?
4;4;Claw and Hoarder: Special Ricktim's Morty;Slut Dragon #2;Shadow Jacker, you haven't come out of your masturbation cave in eons.
4;4;Claw and Hoarder: Special Ricktim's Morty;Shadow Jacker;It's high time I emerge from my cum cocoon. I grow tired of eavesdropping and masturbating to the sounds you all make.
4;4;Claw and Hoarder: Special Ricktim's Morty;Rick;Jesus christ. All right. C-could use a little more mystery. Oh, oh, just now seeing the staff.
4;4;Claw and Hoarder: Special Ricktim's Morty;Shadow Jacker;We've never had enough sluts to defeat the wizard. Now, with the four fresh, wet sluts that just landed on our doorstep, we finally have a chance.
4;4;Claw and Hoarder: Special Ricktim's Morty;Rick;So killing the wizard will break my soul bond.
4;4;Claw and Hoarder: Special Ricktim's Morty;Shadow Jacker;Yes, it solves all of our problems. We must begin a 10-slut soul orgy...
4;4;Claw and Hoarder: Special Ricktim's Morty;Morty;Wait, wait, what?
4;4;Claw and Hoarder: Special Ricktim's Morty;Shadow Jacker;...and become the all-slut slut phoenix dragon, slut.
4;4;Claw and Hoarder: Special Ricktim's Morty;Morty;Wait, wait, wait, wait. Hold on. Hold on. There's got to be something else in here. There's got to be another way. Just give me a second. I haven't read all this yet.
4;4;Claw and Hoarder: Special Ricktim's Morty;Rick;Maybe don't tell your parents we did this?
4;4;Claw and Hoarder: Special Ricktim's Morty;Wizard;Oh, oh, no. Oh... wait, please, no! Ice spell! Ice spell!
4;4;Claw and Hoarder: Special Ricktim's Morty;Wizard;Oh, God! That just made it last longer. Ah, it burns longer! Ah, I could have died fast!
4;4;Claw and Hoarder: Special Ricktim's Morty;Slut Dragon #1;Thank you, strangers.
4;4;Claw and Hoarder: Special Ricktim's Morty;Rick;Well, it's your world now. Have fun with empowerment. It seems to make everyone that gets it really happy. All right, guys. I'll use this to open a portal. Uh, open a portal to Earth. Let's get the hell out of here fast.
4;4;Claw and Hoarder: Special Ricktim's Morty;Rick;God, look at this piece of shit. Why is there writing on it? Who writes on a portal?
4;4;Claw and Hoarder: Special Ricktim's Morty;Rick;Should've taken me up on those Wolverine claws instead, Morty. Wait, why did the dragon come?
4;4;Claw and Hoarder: Special Ricktim's Morty;Balthromaw;I was thinking we could hang out?
4;4;Claw and Hoarder: Special Ricktim's Morty;Rick;Oh, yeah. Whoa, Jesus. Your dad's been texting me this whole time? Uh, he's at an airport with a cat. Okay, that... That sounds... wow. You know, I better check on him. Big season finale right there, you know? Better, uh... Better go right now.
4;4;Claw and Hoarder: Special Ricktim's Morty;Rick;Also, I told you not to get a dragon, Morty. This is your fault. Fuck you, worst adventure ever.
4;4;Claw and Hoarder: Special Ricktim's Morty;Summer;Worst adventure ever.
4;4;Claw and Hoarder: Special Ricktim's Morty;Morty;Yeah, uh, I guess you better be on your way too, Balthromaw.
4;4;Claw and Hoarder: Special Ricktim's Morty;Balthromaw;Well, I've been thinking. What you said back there in the cave really resonated with me. Maybe we could try again?
4;4;Claw and Hoarder: Special Ricktim's Morty;Morty;Look, to be honest, I'm kind of grossed out with the sexual nature of how everything unfolded. I didn't know how sexual dragons were. I kind of just wanted to do some D&D stuff, you know?
4;4;Claw and Hoarder: Special Ricktim's Morty;Balthromaw;And have a soul orgy with your sister and grandpa nd every dragon we could find, yeah?
4;4;Claw and Hoarder: Special Ricktim's Morty;Morty;No, look, can you please just go? I-I-I really want to shower.
4;4;Claw and Hoarder: Special Ricktim's Morty;Balthromaw;Maybe a quick soul bone before I go.
4;4;Claw and Hoarder: Special Ricktim's Morty;Morty;I-I-I-I'm good. I think I just need to be alone and sort of un... Unpack all this.
4;4;Claw and Hoarder: Special Ricktim's Morty;Balthromaw;What about your grandpa? Would he want to? I can wait.
4;4;Claw and Hoarder: Special Ricktim's Morty;Morty;No, I think you better go. I-I'm gonna take that shower.
4;4;Claw and Hoarder: Special Ricktim's Morty;Balthromaw;If it's just warm liquid you want trickled over your body, I could maybe...
4;4;Claw and Hoarder: Special Ricktim's Morty;Morty;No, no, look. I just want to be clean! I-I-I feel dirty after everything that's happened.
4;4;Claw and Hoarder: Special Ricktim's Morty;Balthromaw;How about a quick hand bond? I like doing it.
4;4;Claw and Hoarder: Special Ricktim's Morty;Morty;You're embarrassing yourself. I-I-I'm closing the door.
4;4;Claw and Hoarder: Special Ricktim's Morty;Balthromaw;Fucking soul teasers.
4;4;Claw and Hoarder: Special Ricktim's Morty;Talking Cat;This is a cool car. I like having fun. That's what I'm talking about. Keep it moving. Don't ask why I can talk. Mm, mm, mm.
4;4;Claw and Hoarder: Special Ricktim's Morty;Rick;Uh-huh.
4;4;Claw and Hoarder: Special Ricktim's Morty;Jerry;For sure. For sure.
4;4;Claw and Hoarder: Special Ricktim's Morty;Talking Cat;Where are we going?
4;4;Claw and Hoarder: Special Ricktim's Morty;Rick;Quantum radiator might need some nanowater. We... We can stretch our legs. So, uh, why can you talk?
4;4;Claw and Hoarder: Special Ricktim's Morty;Talking Cat;What is this?
4;4;Claw and Hoarder: Special Ricktim's Morty;Rick;I need you in one spot for a clean mind scan.
4;4;Claw and Hoarder: Special Ricktim's Morty;Talking Cat;Mind scan? Look, you're overthinking it. The point of a talking cat is to have fun.
4;4;Claw and Hoarder: Special Ricktim's Morty;Rick;I find the insinuation that I can't ask questions and have fun condescending. Y-you find it condescending, Jerry?
4;4;Claw and Hoarder: Special Ricktim's Morty;Jerry;Yes.
4;4;Claw and Hoarder: Special Ricktim's Morty;Talking Cat;All right. I'm from outer space. Happy? 
4;4;Claw and Hoarder: Special Ricktim's Morty;Jerry;No.
4;4;Claw and Hoarder: Special Ricktim's Morty;Talking Cat;Exactly, because no answer would be satisfying.
4;4;Claw and Hoarder: Special Ricktim's Morty;Rick;Because it's a lie. Let's see the truth. What in the... Oh, son of a bitch. Jerry, don't.
4;4;Claw and Hoarder: Special Ricktim's Morty;Jerry;I want to see.
4;4;Claw and Hoarder: Special Ricktim's Morty;Rick;No, you do not.
4;4;Claw and Hoarder: Special Ricktim's Morty;Jerry;No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no!
4;4;Claw and Hoarder: Special Ricktim's Morty;Talking Cat;At least now maybe...
4;4;Claw and Hoarder: Special Ricktim's Morty;Rick;Get the hell out of here!
4;4;Claw and Hoarder: Special Ricktim's Morty;Talking Cat;But I've got nowhere to go.
4;4;Claw and Hoarder: Special Ricktim's Morty;Rick;Get out!
4;4;Claw and Hoarder: Special Ricktim's Morty;Jerry;Get out!
4;4;Claw and Hoarder: Special Ricktim's Morty;Rick;Get out!
4;4;Claw and Hoarder: Special Ricktim's Morty;Jerry;He was in my home where I keep photos of my parents.
4;4;Claw and Hoarder: Special Ricktim's Morty;Rick;Jerry, I have a device. I-it can make us forget. 
4;4;Claw and Hoarder: Special Ricktim's Morty;Jerry;No, I don't think we should forget, not this. Someone has to remember. 
4;4;Claw and Hoarder: Special Ricktim's Morty;Rick;Someone will.
4;4;Claw and Hoarder: Special Ricktim's Morty;Jerry;Did we crash? Where's the cat?
4;4;Claw and Hoarder: Special Ricktim's Morty;Rick;He, uh, ran away.
4;4;Claw and Hoarder: Special Ricktim's Morty;Jerry;Did you scan his brain?
4;4;Claw and Hoarder: Special Ricktim's Morty;Rick;Yeah.
4;4;Claw and Hoarder: Special Ricktim's Morty;Jerry;Did you find out why he can talk?
4;4;Claw and Hoarder: Special Ricktim's Morty;Rick;He's from outer space.
4;4;Claw and Hoarder: Special Ricktim's Morty;Jerry;Outer space? That little... Of course, total mind fuck.
4;4;Claw and Hoarder: Special Ricktim's Morty;Man;Now, that's what I call draggin'.
4;4;Claw and Hoarder: Special Ricktim's Morty;Balthromaw;What?
4;4;Claw and Hoarder: Special Ricktim's Morty;Man;It's a joke. You're a dragon draggin' your stuff.
4;4;Claw and Hoarder: Special Ricktim's Morty;Balthromaw;I understand.
4;4;Claw and Hoarder: Special Ricktim's Morty;Man;So, how you doing?
4;4;Claw and Hoarder: Special Ricktim's Morty;Balthromaw;I grow weary of you humans.
4;4;Claw and Hoarder: Special Ricktim's Morty;Man;How about 50 bucks? You weary of 50 bucks? I'm trying to cheat on my wife. I'm looking for a little magic, a little fantasy. You could use some help. Let's help each other, huh? 50 bucks.
4;4;Claw and Hoarder: Special Ricktim's Morty;Man;Slut!
4;4;Claw and Hoarder: Special Ricktim's Morty;Talking Cat;Nice.
4;4;Claw and Hoarder: Special Ricktim's Morty;Balthromaw;Is there a reason you can speak?
4;4;Claw and Hoarder: Special Ricktim's Morty;Talking Cat;Yeah, and I'm ashamed of it.
4;4;Claw and Hoarder: Special Ricktim's Morty;Balthromaw;Then speak of it no more. Do you wish to eat, maybe bond a little?
4;4;Claw and Hoarder: Special Ricktim's Morty;Talking Cat;Yeah, I could bond. How long does it take you to fly to Florida?
4;5;Rattlestar Ricklactica;Rick;Morty, be sure to pee before we go. This adventure is gonna be a long haul, and I don't feel like emptying the jug.
4;5;Rattlestar Ricklactica;Rick;Jerry, will you please just let me automate this fucking task?
4;5;Rattlestar Ricklactica;Jerry;I didn't ask for anyone's help. You two are welcome to leave.
4;5;Rattlestar Ricklactica;Morty;Mom told me she wanted me to stay here to make sure you didn't die.
4;5;Rattlestar Ricklactica;Jerry;Well, you tell your mother that I'm gonna be fine.
4;5;Rattlestar Ricklactica;Rick;Don't train your child to lie, Jerry, even though, you know, 'tis the season.
4;5;Rattlestar Ricklactica;Jerry;Then I'll tell her. Whoa! I told you, no more rays. What ray did you zap me with?
4;5;Rattlestar Ricklactica;Rick;I made your atomic matrix slightly lighter than air, and now your shoes are heavier than air, which makes you neutrally buoyant, which I find personally more impressive conceptually than walking on water, but what do I know? I wasn't born into the god business. I fucking earned it.
4;5;Rattlestar Ricklactica;Jerry;Whoa! Just to be clear, this doesn't mean you helped me.
4;5;Rattlestar Ricklactica;Rick;It wears off in 10 hours, and the next hit will cost you 30 bucks.
4;5;Rattlestar Ricklactica;Jerry;Like I'll even be using it in 10 hours. Siri, set a 9-hour and 50-minute timer.
4;5;Rattlestar Ricklactica;Siri;Playing The Beatles.
4;5;Rattlestar Ricklactica;Morty;I need to pee. 
4;5;Rattlestar Ricklactica;Rick;Nope. Here, I've got a centipede you can swallow that makes you not have to go.
4;5;Rattlestar Ricklactica;Morty;I ain't swallowing no centipede.
4;5;Rattlestar Ricklactica;Rick;What, you think the centipede wants to eat your pee? You're not the victim in this transaction. Uh-oh, flat tire.
4;5;Rattlestar Ricklactica;Morty;How the hell do you get a flat tire in space, Rick?
4;5;Rattlestar Ricklactica;Rick;Obviously from a sharp thing in space, Morty.
4;5;Rattlestar Ricklactica;Morty;It's just crazy how much it feels like getting a regular flat.
4;5;Rattlestar Ricklactica;Rick;Oh, no, no, that's just my custom-programmed, fully immersive flat-tire indication experience. I can turn it off. I thought it was cooler than the celebrity voice package, but here.
4;5;Rattlestar Ricklactica;Christopher Walken;Flat tire... you should be... walkin'.
4;5;Rattlestar Ricklactica;Morty;Oof.
4;5;Rattlestar Ricklactica;Rick;Yeah.
4;5;Rattlestar Ricklactica;Morty;Can I come out with you, Rick?
4;5;Rattlestar Ricklactica;Rick;No, I've seen this movie. Two guys leave the ship. One guy goes spinning away. You're staying in here where it's safe.
4;5;Rattlestar Ricklactica;Rick;Morty, goddamn it.
4;5;Rattlestar Ricklactica;Morty;Come on. I n... I never get to be out here.
4;5;Rattlestar Ricklactica;Rick;"Ugh, you young people think space is like Saturday Night Live."" You see it every day, so you dream of being in it, but it dreams of removing all the air from your body and making you float around it for eternity as a flash-mummified corpse, which is also what space wants, so get back in the car."""
4;5;Rattlestar Ricklactica;Morty;I'm not in danger. There's nothing out here. 
4;5;Rattlestar Ricklactica;Rick;Literally everything is out here, and unlike everywhere else, I'm too busy to help you.
4;5;Rattlestar Ricklactica;Morty;Right, because you're always so helpful. Ah!
4;5;Rattlestar Ricklactica;Rick;God damn it.
4;5;Rattlestar Ricklactica;Morty;What is that?
4;5;Rattlestar Ricklactica;Rick;Obviously, it's a space snake.
4;5;Rattlestar Ricklactica;Morty;T-There's snakes in space?
4;5;Rattlestar Ricklactica;Rick;There's literally everything in space, Morty! Now get the fuck back in the car.
4;5;Rattlestar Ricklactica;Morty;I'm dying, Rick. I can see the black mountain.
4;5;Rattlestar Ricklactica;Rick;People who are really dying don't keep bring it up.
4;5;Rattlestar Ricklactica;Morty;Is that true?
4;5;Rattlestar Ricklactica;Rick;I don't know. I'm just usually around people that die faster. All right. All right. J-Just let me analyze the snake's planet, so I can whip up an antivenom.
4;5;Rattlestar Ricklactica;Rick;Computer, you might want to put a rush on this. Morty's starting to look like a '90s Japanese ghost.
4;5;Rattlestar Ricklactica;Computer;Cutting corners.
4;5;Rattlestar Ricklactica;Rick;Oof, oh, my God, these snakes are a mess. 19 billion snakes divided into 10,000 nations all on the brink of global war over... race. How funny is that? 
4;5;Rattlestar Ricklactica;Rick;"Imagine being a racist snake. Hey, other snake, I hate you because you're the wrong color, snake."" Oh, my God. You're not laughing? Oh, you're dying. It's a miracle they were able to fling one this far out before they slithered into extinction."""
4;5;Rattlestar Ricklactica;Morty;Oh, oh, God, I killed their... What's his name, their Buzz Aspirin?
4;5;Rattlestar Ricklactica;Rick;It's actually Buzz Advil, Morty, and, uh, this is totally different. It's a female snake. There's an extra layer of heartbreak. 
4;5;Rattlestar Ricklactica;Rick;Wait. Wait. Morty, Morty, you hear that? Listen. Snake jazz. Ha. Idiots. Let's get moving. We've got a long way to go, and I'm not sharing that centipede.
4;5;Rattlestar Ricklactica;Morty;Rick, wait. Go back. I-I can't be the reason why 19 billion snakes lost all hope.
4;5;Rattlestar Ricklactica;Rick;"That's right, Morty. Only 19 billion snakes can do that. That species was never getting beyond this stage. To paraphrase the great Jeff Foxworthy, if you bite your first contact on its ankle, you might be a type-zero-civilization-neck."""""
4;5;Rattlestar Ricklactica;Jerry;What up, homeys? Shooting hoops, I see. Hey, who's interested in a friendly bet that this white guy can jump.
4;5;Rattlestar Ricklactica;Basketball Player;Hey, leave the racial stuff off the court, okay?
4;5;Rattlestar Ricklactica;Jerry;Oh, I thought that kind of talk was part of street ball.
4;5;Rattlestar Ricklactica;Basketball Player;Well, now it's part of everything else, so chill.
4;5;Rattlestar Ricklactica;Jerry;We... We got off on the wrong foot. My name is Jerry Smith. I live in the suburbs. I'm only here because I have a certain power I wanted to kind of celebrate before it goes away.
4;5;Rattlestar Ricklactica;Basketball Player;Yo, we got a Nazi up here.
4;5;Rattlestar Ricklactica;Jerry;Hey, I think there's a misunderstanding. Here, just... just watch. Huh? Help! Help! I-I need that shoe!
4;5;Rattlestar Ricklactica;Basketball Player;No, no, don't touch that shoe or that money. Let them be a powerful but confusing monument to our neighborhood's integrity.
4;5;Rattlestar Ricklactica;Rick;Oh, boy, what an adventure, huh? Hey, Morty, listen. I can tell you're pretty upset about the whole snake encounter thing, so I'll tell you what. I'm just gonna go ahead and avoid you for the rest of the day.
4;5;Rattlestar Ricklactica;Morty;Play snake jazz.
4;5;Rattlestar Ricklactica;Morty;I-Is this one friendly?
4;5;Rattlestar Ricklactica;Snake Seller;It's a snake.
4;5;Rattlestar Ricklactica;Morty;You ever... You ever see this one look up at the sky like it's dreaming of something more?
4;5;Rattlestar Ricklactica;Snake Seller;No, but, uh, all those ones marked with red sticker, yeah. Any snake over 50 bucks yearns for the beyond. I-I-I've seen them do it.
4;5;Rattlestar Ricklactica;Morty;Ow! Damn it, Slippy, come on. Ow! Just please. I'm sorry.
4;5;Rattlestar Ricklactica;Man on TV;Everyone has a plumbus in their home. First, they take the dinglepop.
4;5;Rattlestar Ricklactica;Morty;Ow! Fucking monster.
4;5;Rattlestar Ricklactica;Summer;Downbeat.
4;5;Rattlestar Ricklactica;Rick;How do you win this game?
4;5;Rattlestar Ricklactica;Morty;We-We've never gotten that far.
4;5;Rattlestar Ricklactica;Beth;Guys, did I not tell you to keep your eye on Jerry?
4;5;Rattlestar Ricklactica;Morty;We did.
4;5;Rattlestar Ricklactica;Beth;Then where is he?
4;5;Rattlestar Ricklactica;Rick;Maybe he's having an affair.
4;5;Rattlestar Ricklactica;Beth;But for real, has anyone seen him?
4;5;Rattlestar Ricklactica;Summer;Grandpa, did you trap him in a painting again?
4;5;Rattlestar Ricklactica;Rick;I didn't do shit.
4;5;Rattlestar Ricklactica;Morty;Well, y-y-you made him floaty.
4;5;Rattlestar Ricklactica;Rick;Asshole.
4;5;Rattlestar Ricklactica;Beth;Made him floaty?
4;5;Rattlestar Ricklactica;Rick;I saved his life by making his body slightly lighter than air, and it expires in a couple of hours.
4;5;Rattlestar Ricklactica;Beth;Expires, like he'll fall out of the sky?
4;5;Rattlestar Ricklactica;Rick;He won't by in the sky, Beth, unless it's possible for Jerry to fuck up wearing shoes. Oh, crap, he's gonna die.
4;5;Rattlestar Ricklactica;Beth;What were you thinking?
4;5;Rattlestar Ricklactica;Jerry;Hey, babe.
4;5;Rattlestar Ricklactica;Beth;Jerry, are you in the air? Rick told me he made you floaty.
4;5;Rattlestar Ricklactica;Jerry;Made me floaty? Pfft. Got to love Rick's world view. Yes, I had Rick make me floaty so I could put up some lights. Now, I'm at the light store. 
4;5;Rattlestar Ricklactica;Jerry;Get away! Sorry, this lady at the store  is trying to peck me. Yes, you can help me find lights after I'm off the phone.
4;5;Rattlestar Ricklactica;Beth;We're in Rick's ship. How about we just pick you up?
4;5;Rattlestar Ricklactica;Jerry;You're with Rick?
4;5;Rattlestar Ricklactica;Beth;Well, why wouldn't I...
4;5;Rattlestar Ricklactica;Rick;Jerry, I paused Beth with a device Christopher Walken gave me after a record session. Real talk, buddy, where you at?
4;5;Rattlestar Ricklactica;Jerry;Go to hell, Rick.
4;5;Rattlestar Ricklactica;Rick;Come on, Jerry. I can recognize the sound of a seagull.
4;5;Rattlestar Ricklactica;Jerry;Can you recognize the sound of a man's pants filling up with rain?
4;5;Rattlestar Ricklactica;Rick;I hope to one day. Jerry, I'll tell you what. Because it's Christmas, I'm gonna do you a favor. I won't let you die, and I won't tell Beth that you almost killed yourself.
4;5;Rattlestar Ricklactica;Jerry;Sounds like a win-win to me.
4;5;Rattlestar Ricklactica;Rick;Come again?
4;5;Rattlestar Ricklactica;Jerry;If I survive, it'll be without you, and if I die, it'll be on your ass. Merry Christmas, bitch. I am the Jesus Christ of Christmas!
4;5;Rattlestar Ricklactica;Beth;...I be with him? We both care. Whoa. Jerry.
4;5;Rattlestar Ricklactica;Jerry Clone Head;Yes, honey?
4;5;Rattlestar Ricklactica;Rick;Let us just come get you.
4;5;Rattlestar Ricklactica;Jerry Clone Head;Beth, I am so touched that you care for me this much, but I'm fine, and I just want to put up these Christmas lights, and I will eat your world.
4;5;Rattlestar Ricklactica;Beth;Honey, my dad can hear you.
4;5;Rattlestar Ricklactica;Jerry Clone Head;Got to go. See you soon.
4;5;Rattlestar Ricklactica;Beth;Okay.
4;5;Rattlestar Ricklactica;Beth;Well, it sounds like he's fine.
4;5;Rattlestar Ricklactica;Rick;Yeah, I'm almost kind of rooting for him this time.
4;5;Rattlestar Ricklactica;Jerry;One Diet Sprite Remix, please, and, uh, is anyone here an Uber driver?
4;5;Rattlestar Ricklactica;Woman Bartender;You can't bring that boulder in here.
4;5;Rattlestar Ricklactica;Jerry;What?
4;5;Rattlestar Ricklactica;Woman Bartender;I said no boulders. This ain't the lake, buddy.
4;5;Rattlestar Ricklactica;Bar client #1;Drop the rock.
4;5;Rattlestar Ricklactica;Jerry;Well, it's kind of a... a service boulder. Yeah, I float without it.
4;5;Rattlestar Ricklactica;Bar client #2;Big man holding a big rock, think you can take me down?
4;5;Rattlestar Ricklactica;Jerry;No, obviously not. You're huge.
4;5;Rattlestar Ricklactica;Bar client #2;Then put it down. 
4;5;Rattlestar Ricklactica;Bar client #3;Put the boulder down!
4;5;Rattlestar Ricklactica;Jerry;If I put it down, I'm going to float. And frankly, your bar has a lot of ceiling fans.
4;5;Rattlestar Ricklactica;Bar client #3;Drop it!
4;5;Rattlestar Ricklactica;Bar client #2;Put it down!
4;5;Rattlestar Ricklactica;Bar client #1;You think you're better than us?
4;5;Rattlestar Ricklactica;Bar client #3;Drop the rock.
4;5;Rattlestar Ricklactica;Bar client #2;Put it down.
4;5;Rattlestar Ricklactica;Jerry;Okay, okay, okay.
4;5;Rattlestar Ricklactica;Bar client #3;Hey, whoa, what the fuck?!
4;5;Rattlestar Ricklactica;Bar client #2;Stop doing that.
4;5;Rattlestar Ricklactica;Jerry;I told you this would happen.
4;5;Rattlestar Ricklactica;Bar client #2;Well, stop floating.
4;5;Rattlestar Ricklactica;Bar client #3;Who said you could float here?
4;5;Rattlestar Ricklactica;Jerry;I can't control it.
4;5;Rattlestar Ricklactica;Jerry;Aaaaaaaaaah!
4;5;Rattlestar Ricklactica;Bar client #3;And take your girlfriend with you.
4;5;Rattlestar Ricklactica;Tricia;Summer, how supes shook am I about your playlisting fleekness tonight?
4;5;Rattlestar Ricklactica;Summer;You love it? It's snake jazz. My little brother got bit by a snake in outer space and killed it with a hubcap, and my grandpa had to scan its planet's culture for an antivenom, and they found this. It's my jam.
4;5;Rattlestar Ricklactica;Tricia;Seriously, my new thing now is snake jazz.
4;5;Rattlestar Ricklactica;Nancy;Can you alter the course of a species' evolution like that without repercussions?
4;5;Rattlestar Ricklactica;Summer;Gee, I don't know, Nancy. Can you alter the course of being a fucking giant nerd?
4;5;Rattlestar Ricklactica;Nancy;Sorry.
4;5;Rattlestar Ricklactica;Tricia;Also, later, we need to discuss your clothing and your weight.
4;5;Rattlestar Ricklactica;Nancy;That's fair.
4;5;Rattlestar Ricklactica;Morty;What the hell?
4;5;Rattlestar Ricklactica;Snake Cyborg;Target acquired.
4;5;Rattlestar Ricklactica;Morty;Snakes! Get back in the car!
4;5;Rattlestar Ricklactica;Rick;Morty, enough with the... Snakes!
4;5;Rattlestar Ricklactica;Snake Cyborg;Target acquired.
4;5;Rattlestar Ricklactica;Snake Resistance Robot;Aliens, I am a robot sent back in time by the Snake Resistance to protect you from Serpacorp. My appearance is designed to be familiar and to put you at ease.
4;5;Rattlestar Ricklactica;Snake Cyborg;The ape child must be eliminated to protect our timeline.
4;5;Rattlestar Ricklactica;Rick;Morty, what the hell did you do?
4;5;Rattlestar Ricklactica;Morty;I was just trying to do the right thing. I took a living snake...
4;5;Rattlestar Ricklactica;Snake Resistance Robot;Get behind me. I will protect...
4;5;Rattlestar Ricklactica;Beth;Aaah!
4;5;Rattlestar Ricklactica;Morty;Why... Why are they attacking us? I-I-I helped them.
4;5;Rattlestar Ricklactica;Rick;You gave them proof that there was something bigger and scarier to unite against, you little idiot. They would have gone back into the Dark Ages for a couple of generations, but instead, they dedicated themselves into making universe-destroying, un-thought-out technology like time travel all so they could try to kill a little shit sack on Earth who couldn't let a dead snake be dead even after it bit his ankle. Next time, stay in the fucking car!
4;5;Rattlestar Ricklactica;Narrator;17 billion snake lives ended on June 21, 2026. The survivors lived only to face a new nightmare, the war between snake and machine. In the end, snake overcame machine because of what we couldn't predict... That an alien, a child from a distant star, would save us.
4;5;Rattlestar Ricklactica;Morty;W-Where are we going? W-What are we doing here, Rick?
4;5;Rattlestar Ricklactica;Rick;We got to get the heart of Snake Net. Now, shut up, and stay close.
4;5;Rattlestar Ricklactica;Snake Cyborg;Resistance is mouselike.
4;5;Rattlestar Ricklactica;Rick;Whoa, hey, look. That one's actually really cool. Come here, little guy. Ah, you little son of a bitch! Come on, Morty.
4;5;Rattlestar Ricklactica;Snake Cyborg;Your brood must be exterminated.
4;5;Rattlestar Ricklactica;Snake Resistance Robot;You will not kill her or her brood.
4;5;Rattlestar Ricklactica;Snake Cyborg;Must kill brood and mother.
4;5;Rattlestar Ricklactica;Snake Resistance Agent;Get behind me. Your brood will seed all life on this planet.
4;5;Rattlestar Ricklactica;Snake Cyborg;That doesn't make sense.
4;5;Rattlestar Ricklactica;Snake Resistance Robot;That didn't make sense.
4;5;Rattlestar Ricklactica;Morty;Hey, it's... it's Slippy!
4;5;Rattlestar Ricklactica;Rick;Keep up, shit bag.
4;5;Rattlestar Ricklactica;Beth;Hi, you went directly to voicemail because your number is not in my phone. Don't leave a message.
4;5;Rattlestar Ricklactica;Jerry;Hi, honey. Uh, look. Morty told me that you didn't think I could hang lights without killing myself. Look, I want to be a strong man for you, but the truth is... The truth is, I'm coming home with the best lights ever.
4;5;Rattlestar Ricklactica;Plane Pilot;Whoa, feel that turbulence?
4;5;Rattlestar Ricklactica;Plane Co-Pilot;Nope, I'm on molly.
4;5;Rattlestar Ricklactica;Plane Pilot;Give me some. Ahh.
4;5;Rattlestar Ricklactica;Siri;10 hours has expired.
4;5;Rattlestar Ricklactica;Jerry;Aaaah!
4;5;Rattlestar Ricklactica;Rick;I don't suppose you guys will take a bribe?
4;5;Rattlestar Ricklactica;Rick;Anyone else want legs?
4;5;Rattlestar Ricklactica;Rick;God damn it. Are you kidding me? I thought there'd be a time machine in here. They're not even a quarter of the way through making it. I'm gonna have to invent it for them. I-I don't know snake math. Ugh, I didn't want to have to do this. Fuck. All right.
4;5;Rattlestar Ricklactica;Morty;W-What's going on? What are you doing?
4;5;Rattlestar Ricklactica;Rick;I'm reminding myself to commit even more to your up.
4;5;Rattlestar Ricklactica;Future Rick;Hey, assholes.
4;5;Rattlestar Ricklactica;Rick;Fuck you. Takes one to know one.
4;5;Rattlestar Ricklactica;Morty;What the heck? Hey, man, you... you okay?
4;5;Rattlestar Ricklactica;Future Morty;You know what? Fuck you.
4;5;Rattlestar Ricklactica;Morty;What? Screw you.
4;5;Rattlestar Ricklactica;Future Rick;Here.
4;5;Rattlestar Ricklactica;Rick;Come on. Was it really that hard?
4;5;Rattlestar Ricklactica;Future Rick;What do you think? Come on, Morty.
4;5;Rattlestar Ricklactica;Morty;Man, I-I-I wonder why I had a black eye.
4;5;Rattlestar Ricklactica;Rick;Morty, shut the fuck up and put these on.
4;5;Rattlestar Ricklactica;Morty;Okay, so w-what are we doing?
4;5;Rattlestar Ricklactica;Rick;That book has everything they need to create snake time travel, a-and they're getting it in 1985, snake time. Now, they're gonna do it so early that it won't involve us, and they're gonna be even stupider with it.
4;5;Rattlestar Ricklactica;Morty;Huh, a-and then what?
4;5;Rattlestar Ricklactica;Rick;We're removing ourselves from this sloppy, fucked-up story and letting snake time travel eat its own tail.
4;5;Rattlestar Ricklactica;Jerry;Just have to keep my grip.
4;5;Rattlestar Ricklactica;Human-snake hybrid;Jerry Smith, I am here to save you.
4;5;Rattlestar Ricklactica;Jerry;What? I already told Rick I don't want help.
4;5;Rattlestar Ricklactica;Human-snake hybrid;I do not know Rick. I was sent by a society of human-snake hybrids from an alternate version...
4;5;Rattlestar Ricklactica;Jerry;Classic Rick.
4;5;Rattlestar Ricklactica;Jerry;I did it! We're landing! I knew I could do it.
4;5;Rattlestar Ricklactica;Morty;Jesus Christ, Rick, it's pandemonium out there! T-This is worse than when we left. Rick, look, Summer!
4;5;Rattlestar Ricklactica;Summer;Nobody chokes me without consent.
4;5;Rattlestar Ricklactica;Morty;Y-You just made things worse, Rick.
4;5;Rattlestar Ricklactica;Rick;Trust me, Morty. We helped them press on the gas pedal. We just got to wait for them to blow by a cop.
4;5;Rattlestar Ricklactica;Shleemypants;Shleemypants here, what's up? Snakes? Time travel? They did what? How the fuck did... Okay, okay, I'm on it. We got a 10-51 on a goddamn snake planet.
4;5;Rattlestar Ricklactica;Time Cop;Don't look at me. I'm afraid of snakes.
4;5;Rattlestar Ricklactica;Shleemypants;"I'm afraid of snakes"", bullshit. You afraid of work. That's what you afraid of."""
4;5;Rattlestar Ricklactica;Time Cop;All right. All right.
4;5;Rattlestar Ricklactica;Shleemypants;Let's go take care of this.
4;5;Rattlestar Ricklactica;Shleemypants;Oh, look at you. You a smart snake, huh? You using tools now, huh?
4;5;Rattlestar Ricklactica;Time Cop;Those tools are gonna turn into you manipulating the fabric of shit. Get over here, motherfucker!
4;5;Rattlestar Ricklactica;Shleemypants;What the fuck you think you doing?
4;5;Rattlestar Ricklactica;Time Cop;Don't fuck with time.
4;5;Rattlestar Ricklactica;Shleemypants;You don't fuck with time.
4;5;Rattlestar Ricklactica;Morty;Holy shit!
4;5;Rattlestar Ricklactica;Beth;What happened? Look, this is better than them attacking us.
4;5;Rattlestar Ricklactica;Rick;Also, that's about as much curvature as you're gonna get from a time-travel story. 
4;5;Rattlestar Ricklactica;Rick;You know what? This one counts as one of your adventures.
4;5;Rattlestar Ricklactica;Morty;Hey, come on.
4;5;Rattlestar Ricklactica;Rick;No freebies.
4;5;Rattlestar Ricklactica;Morty;Aw, man, I-I wanted to go to Boob World.
4;5;Rattlestar Ricklactica;Rick;Well, now, we can't because you fucked up. Got to learn a lesson.
4;5;Rattlestar Ricklactica;Rick;You want to go to Boob World, Summer?
4;5;Rattlestar Ricklactica;Summer;Eh, not today.
4;5;Rattlestar Ricklactica;Rick;This sucks.
4;5;Rattlestar Ricklactica;Jerry;Hey, honey, check it out.
4;5;Rattlestar Ricklactica;Beth;Jerry, I was worried about you.
4;5;Rattlestar Ricklactica;Jerry;Oh, just killing some snakes up here like everyone else, I guess, and finishing the Christmas lights.
4;5;Rattlestar Ricklactica;Beth;Wait, the whole time? I was screaming for help, and you stayed on the roof?
4;5;Rattlestar Ricklactica;Jerry;I couldn't hear you over my own screaming. We've talked about this.
4;5;Rattlestar Ricklactica;Beth;Well, I'm just glad you're safe.
4;5;Rattlestar Ricklactica;Jerry;Well, duh, of course, I'm safe. Hey, guess what, asshole. I did it without you.
4;5;Rattlestar Ricklactica;Jerry;Whoa! Ah! Oh, God, it hurts. What was that?
4;5;Rattlestar Ricklactica;Rick;I healed your leg 50%. The rest is on you, big man.
4;5;Rattlestar Ricklactica;Jerry;That's what I'm talking about. Respect, my brother.
4;5;Rattlestar Ricklactica;Rick;Geez, your dad sucks. All right, Morty. Let's go enjoy a little bit of eggnog, huh?
4;5;Rattlestar Ricklactica;Morty;All right.
4;5;Rattlestar Ricklactica;Future Rick;Not so fast, boys.
4;5;Rattlestar Ricklactica;Future Morty;Yeah, I think you might be forgetting something.
4;5;Rattlestar Ricklactica;Future Rick;Merry Christmas, fuck nuts. Get to work.
4;5;Rattlestar Ricklactica;Rick;Geez, I don't see why you have to be smug about it.
4;5;Rattlestar Ricklactica;Morty;A bunch of bullshit.
4;5;Rattlestar Ricklactica;Rick;That's not necessary. This fucking sucks.
4;5;Rattlestar Ricklactica;Future Rick;Yeah, it's fun until it's you, huh, shit nog?
4;5;Rattlestar Ricklactica;Future Morty;Yeah, have fun sewing those snake costumes together, you little tramp.
4;5;Rattlestar Ricklactica;Future Rick;You tell them, Morty.
4;5;Rattlestar Ricklactica;Rick;Geez, you guys don't have to be dicks about it, all right?
4;5;Rattlestar Ricklactica;Future Morty;Yeah, neither did the guys before us, but you know what? They were. Merry Christmas, you shit bags.
4;5;Rattlestar Ricklactica;Future Rick;Yeah, ghost of Christmas future, bitches, you idiots.
4;5;Rattlestar Ricklactica;Morty;So mean.
4;5;Rattlestar Ricklactica;Rick;Those guys are mean.
4;5;Rattlestar Ricklactica;Morty;Man, I just want to open my Christmas presents.
4;5;Rattlestar Ricklactica;Rick;Well, I'm waiting on you to finish those snake costumes.
4;5;Rattlestar Ricklactica;Morty;I'm almost done. You know what? T-They're good enough. I'm done.
4;5;Rattlestar Ricklactica;Rick;All right. Let's go.
4;5;Rattlestar Ricklactica;Rick;All right. We're landing. Come on.
4;5;Rattlestar Ricklactica;Morty;Man, I can't believe we're almost done, Rick. I can practically taste the eggnog. Hey, you know what? I... I feel like we're forgetting something.
4;5;Rattlestar Ricklactica;Rick;Oh, yeah, uh, thanks for reminding me. Morty, next time, stay in the car.
4;6;Never Ricking Morty;Tickets Please Guy;Tickets, please.
4;6;Never Ricking Morty;Vengeful Train Passenger;Barkeep. A drink for my colleague.
4;6;Never Ricking Morty;Male Disguise;Do I know you?
4;6;Never Ricking Morty;Vengeful Train Passenger;I know the only reason to travel by train is to travel with weapons. And we all know that at the end of this line, there's only one creature worth killing. The man in the white coat. May as well take turns exchanging stories. Mine begins on planet Ramamama.
4;6;Never Ricking Morty;Vengeful Train Passenger;"Lower him into acid. Once he's dissolved, lower someone else into acid. Is he dissolved? At least use the downtime to reset the acid lowerer. I really don't like the attitude around here. It's a very lower me into acid"" attitude."""
4;6;Never Ricking Morty;Vengeful Train Passenger;Who are you? How did you reach my sanctum? All right, this is going in circles. Seize him!
4;6;Never Ricking Morty;Vengeful Train Passenger;Very well. Now I will fight you.
4;6;Never Ricking Morty;Vengeful Train Passenger;Anyway, he tells a different version of the story. Where I start crying or something. That's why he has to die. 'Cause he's a liar. So... Why are you going to kill Rick Sanchez?
4;6;Never Ricking Morty;Male Disguise;Okay, I don't know who that is. I don't accept your weird leap in logic that has everyone on a train going to kill one guy. And even if I did, why would we take turns telling stories about it like little girls at a sleepover?
4;6;Never Ricking Morty;Vengeful Train Passenger;If you're trying to be hurtful, you're doing a good job. 
4;6;Never Ricking Morty;Clam Lady;I'll take his turn. Here's why I'm going to kill Rick Sanchez.
4;6;Never Ricking Morty;Male Disguise;You guys have fun with this. 
4;6;Never Ricking Morty;Clam Lady;Dissolve to a clam-shaped sun rising over a giant beach.
4;6;Never Ricking Morty;Male Disguise;Whew.
4;6;Never Ricking Morty;Bearded Storyteller;By then, of course, he had left toys. And flesh drops for every one of us in the spore-hive. Ah, a newcomer! I suppose you think you have a better story about how Rick Sanchez saved Space Christmas.
4;6;Never Ricking Morty;Male Disguise;What is with the Rick Sanchez obsession?
4;6;Never Ricking Morty;Goomby;I think the best way to answer that is with my Christmas Rick Tale.
4;6;Never Ricking Morty;Goomby;Whoo! Could've used Rudolph tonight!
4;6;Never Ricking Morty;Rick;Oh, thank god. I'm not too late. I don't know how to thank you, Goomby.
4;6;Never Ricking Morty;Goomby;No need. You just go in there and have a nice time.
4;6;Never Ricking Morty;Rick;I will. Thanks.
4;6;Never Ricking Morty;Rick;Hey. Merry Christmas, Goomby.
4;6;Never Ricking Morty;Goomby;Merry Christmas, Rick.
4;6;Never Ricking Morty;Rick;Oh. Uh...
4;6;Never Ricking Morty;Goomby;Oh, it's okay. I-I don't have to. Sorry if that was...
4;6;Never Ricking Morty;Rick;No. Um, um, I can ask.
4;6;Never Ricking Morty;Goomby;No, no, no, I don't wanna be a burden.
4;6;Never Ricking Morty;Rick;Oh, okay. Yeah, yeah, there's just... There's a lot of people. Family. You know?
4;6;Never Ricking Morty;Goomby;I get it.
4;6;Never Ricking Morty;Rick;You're not mad? 
4;6;Never Ricking Morty;Goomby;Totally fine. Bye.
4;6;Never Ricking Morty;Male Disguise;That... Okay, none of my business, but he didn't even save Christmas in that story.
4;6;Never Ricking Morty;Bearded Storyteller;Oh, how dare you!
4;6;Never Ricking Morty;Male Disguise;That doesn't mean I'm invested.
4;6;Never Ricking Morty;Goomby;Tell your Christmas Rick story!
4;6;Never Ricking Morty;Male Disguise;Step the hell back! Back!
4;6;Never Ricking Morty;Male Disguise;You start teeing up a Rick Sanchez vignette, and you'll be doing it through two holes.
4;6;Never Ricking Morty;Female Disguise;I'm just trying to figure out what's going on with this train.
4;6;Never Ricking Morty;Male Disguise;Do you remember getting on it?
4;6;Never Ricking Morty;Female Disguise;No. First thing I remember is...
4;6;Never Ricking Morty;Tickets Please Guy;Tickets, please.
4;6;Never Ricking Morty;Snow Queen;So, why did you date Rick Sanchez?
4;6;Never Ricking Morty;Female Disguise;What?
4;6;Never Ricking Morty;Snow Queen;Oh, you don't have to pretend you didn't date him. We all did. We get it. Low point in your life, rebound from an ex, et cetera.
4;6;Never Ricking Morty;Female Disguise;No, really, who?
4;6;Never Ricking Morty;Snow Queen;Oh, exactly. In fact, and get this, when he met my family...
4;6;Never Ricking Morty;Rick;Leah! Leah, check it out.
4;6;Never Ricking Morty;Snow Queen's Sister;Where'd you meet this, um... Sprite?
4;6;Never Ricking Morty;Snow Queen;He's actually a human. But he invented portal tech?
4;6;Never Ricking Morty;Concept Of Time;I am the Concept Of Time.
4;6;Never Ricking Morty;Female Disguise;Jesus!
4;6;Never Ricking Morty;Male Disguise;I warned you not to do that.
4;6;Never Ricking Morty;Female Disguise;I wasn't trying. 
4;6;Never Ricking Morty;Male Disguise;You don't have to. The train is obviously amplifying. And linking unrelated narrative fields.
4;6;Never Ricking Morty;Female Disguise;Uh-huh...
4;6;Never Ricking Morty;Male Disguise/Rick;Morty? I told you if you found me again, identify yourself.
4;6;Never Ricking Morty;Female Disguise/Morty;I didn't know it was you. How did you not recognize me? Didn't you create the disguises?
4;6;Never Ricking Morty;Rick;When I create shit, it works, morty. It's called being talented.
4;6;Never Ricking Morty;Morty;Why can't we find the engine? 
4;6;Never Ricking Morty;Rick;It's not a real train, it's a story device. Literally. A literal literary device, quite literally metaphorically containing us.
4;6;Never Ricking Morty;Morty;A simulation.
4;6;Never Ricking Morty;Rick;Worse. An anthology.
4;6;Never Ricking Morty;Morty;Okay, so how... How do we hijack it?
4;6;Never Ricking Morty;Rick;Oh, morty, it's been hijacked for at least two full minutes. Are you not hearing this insane conversation? 
4;6;Never Ricking Morty;Rick;Okay, Tickets Please Guy, stop the anthology. If we wanted one-offs, we'd do Interdimensional Cable, not some uptight, overwritten...
4;6;Never Ricking Morty;Morty;Rick? God damn!
4;6;Never Ricking Morty;Tickets Please Guy;Tickets, please.
4;6;Never Ricking Morty;Morty;Dude, I'm sure you've got, like, so many tickets at this point. Jesus! The Tickets Please Guy is cut! He... he... he's... he's got those things. W-What do you call them... Uhm, cum gutters.
4;6;Never Ricking Morty;Rick;Morty, gross!
4;6;Never Ricking Morty;Morty;That's what people call them.
4;6;Never Ricking Morty;Rick;Gross people. I don't want to have to picture cum so watery in such volumes that... Hey, hey, hey, stay back. I'll kick you. I-I'll kick your shin, bro. Aaah! 
4;6;Never Ricking Morty;Morty;Hey! I'll cook and eat your ticket-taking ass.
4;6;Never Ricking Morty;Rick;Hey, I found a ticket. Wow, you are just... Ladies and gentlemen, the Jackie Chan of human shielding. Who takes the time to get this good at... Fuck this.
4;6;Never Ricking Morty;Story Train Computer;Structural breach. Losing continuity.
4;6;Never Ricking Morty;Rick;Morty, hold on to something. Keep your head inside.
4;6;Never Ricking Morty;Tickets Please Guy;Aaah!
4;6;Never Ricking Morty;Tickets Please Guy's Daughter;Share with your sister, Josh. Just because it's your birthday doesn't mean you can be an asshole. 
4;6;Never Ricking Morty;Tickets Please Guy's Daughter;You okay, dad? 
4;6;Never Ricking Morty;Tickets Please Guy;Is this real?
4;6;Never Ricking Morty;Tickets Please Guy's Daughter;I doubt it, but you get what you get. when you eat dinner in an arcade.
4;6;Never Ricking Morty;Tickets Please Guy;I mean are you real, is life real?
4;6;Never Ricking Morty;Tickets Please Guy's Daughter;Okay, I'm calling the nurse because you are not doing this tonight.
4;6;Never Ricking Morty;Tickets Please Guy;You're god damn right I'm not because...
4;6;Never Ricking Morty;Tickets Please Guy's Daughter;You are not doing this tonight! This isn't real life!
4;6;Never Ricking Morty;Tickets Please Guy's Daughter;Dad? Oh, my god! 
4;6;Never Ricking Morty;Tickets Please Guy;Honey. Sweetie.
4;6;Never Ricking Morty;Tickets Please Guy's Daughter;What's happening?
4;6;Never Ricking Morty;Tickets Please Guy;Give me your tickets. I... I need tickets. Everyone give me tickeeeeeettttttts!
4;6;Never Ricking Morty;Morty;Aaah!
4;6;Never Ricking Morty;Story Train Computer;Emergency continuity deployed.
4;6;Never Ricking Morty;Rick;This could come in handy.
4;6;Never Ricking Morty;Morty;Can't we just ride out the...
4;6;Never Ricking Morty;Rick;Fuck you, I'd rather die.
4;6;Never Ricking Morty;Train Cop #1;Train cops! Hands in the air! Tee up a story about Rick Sanchez!
4;6;Never Ricking Morty;Morty;He is Rick! 
4;6;Never Ricking Morty;Train Cop #2;Jesus Christ! Is that the Tickets Please Guy?
4;6;Never Ricking Morty;Rick;Well, just the stub.
4;6;Never Ricking Morty;Train Cop #1;Too soon! Too soon!
4;6;Never Ricking Morty;Train Cop #2;Don't move! Too soon!
4;6;Never Ricking Morty;Train Cop #3;So, what did the train cops do wrong?
4;6;Never Ricking Morty;Train Cop #4;Shot... People? Shot passengers. 
4;6;Never Ricking Morty;Train Cop #3;Wrong. The passengers tampered with the anthology's structure. Lethal response was permitted, but not with him holding that tank. Let's take a look at what they should have done.
4;6;Never Ricking Morty;Train Cop #1;Train cops! Hands in the air!
4;6;Never Ricking Morty;Train Cop #2;Drop the tank! Drop it!
4;6;Never Ricking Morty;Train Cop #1;Drop it! Drop the tank.
4;6;Never Ricking Morty;Train Cop #5;Sorry to nitpick, sir, but if there was a continuity explosion, isn't there always one? And doesn't that mean those two could be anywhere?
4;6;Never Ricking Morty;Train Cop #3;What? No, you idiot, that... it's... It's just a training video. That didn't actually happen.
4;6;Never Ricking Morty;Rick;That's what you think.
4;6;Never Ricking Morty;Train Cop #3;Hey. How'd you get here?
4;6;Never Ricking Morty;Rick;Yeah, like we're the ones that popped up out of nowhere? Fuck these guys.
4;6;Never Ricking Morty;Morty;Hey, what the hell? Your leg is healed.
4;6;Never Ricking Morty;Rick;Yeah, it's a real free-for-all. Here we go. Of course this thing is just a circle. You'd think it was so god damn complicated... 
4;6;Never Ricking Morty;Rick;Okay, here's where the stupid vignettes were. God, imagine if that had been the whole thing. So now we're here, and the engine must be here. I'll have to rig us a couple of space suits. That start failing around here so we can pay a heavy price for re-entering at this threshold.
4;6;Never Ricking Morty;Morty;We have to leave the train?
4;6;Never Ricking Morty;Rick;We don't have to do anything, Morty. This is just a structural guide. We're obviously gonna impart our own style.
4;6;Never Ricking Morty;Morty;I don't like how meta this is getting, Rick.
4;6;Never Ricking Morty;Rick;Shut up, Morty. You're 14.  You watch videos of people on YouTube reacting to fucking YouTube. I'll be the judge of when we get too meta.
4;6;Never Ricking Morty;Morty;Holy shit! How is he still breathing? 
4;6;Never Ricking Morty;Tickets Please Guy;Aah!
4;6;Never Ricking Morty;Rick;He's suspended in disbelief, slowly dying while living out an alternative, non-diagetic reality.
4;6;Never Ricking Morty;Morty;Geez, what a horrible way to die.
4;6;Never Ricking Morty;Rick;You don't know the half of it.
4;6;Never Ricking Morty;Morty;Oh! You're on fuego with the guy-torn-in-half bits, rick.
4;6;Never Ricking Morty;Rick;That one was organic, though.
4;6;Never Ricking Morty;Morty;That's because you're naturally funny. That... That's good old-fashioned fun right there, you know? W-w-we don't need to over-think shit, okay?
4;6;Never Ricking Morty;Rick;Okay, buddy. Nice and grounded, fully immersive from here on out. Right after this.
4;6;Never Ricking Morty;Morty;W-What's happening?
4;6;Never Ricking Morty;Rick;Going into an act break.
4;6;Never Ricking Morty;Green alien on stage;Sure, that was a great moment, but it was hardly the best time Rick & Morty were musical. Who can forget the t...
4;6;Never Ricking Morty;Phantom of the Opera Alien;Hey. You guys think there's something weird about this train? We've been here a really long time and nobody's taken our tickets. Aaah!
4;6;Never Ricking Morty;Tickets Please Guy;Aaaah!
4;6;Never Ricking Morty;Uncle Nibbles;The galaxy's greatest scientists continue to ponder the horrific figure known to children as Floaty Blood Man. But after three months, nobody is any closer to the truth. For cutesy name news, I'm Uncle Nibbles.
4;6;Never Ricking Morty;Female Pig Alien;I can't believe Floaty Bloody Man is real.
4;6;Never Ricking Morty;Male Pig Alien;He's more than real, he's my new god. Check it. 
4;6;Never Ricking Morty;Female Pig Alien;Is that brand-new, or is the blood just...
4;6;Never Ricking Morty;Male Pig Alien;Accurately depicted, yeah. His followers believe the entire universe is Floaty Bloody Man's nightmare as he dies in a time-dilated reality.
4;6;Never Ricking Morty;Female Pig Alien;So we could go at any minute.
4;6;Never Ricking Morty;Male Pig Alien;No. I'm part of the Floaty Nogasm Brotherhood. We believe we're keeping him alive by redirecting our suppressed sexual energies.
4;6;Never Ricking Morty;Female Pig Alien;You're staying a virgin just to keep the universe existing? That's... So attractive.
4;6;Never Ricking Morty;Male Pig Alien;It is? Okay, look, let's just do it once. Sorry.
4;6;Never Ricking Morty;Tickets Please Guy;Aaah!
4;6;Never Ricking Morty;Rick;Happy now? 
4;6;Never Ricking Morty;Morty;He was suffering.
4;6;Never Ricking Morty;Rick;Keep moving. We have to get to the return threshold before the ticking clock on your suit gets to zero.
4;6;Never Ricking Morty;Morty;Why would you put ticking clock...
4;6;Never Ricking Morty;Rick;Because if it's too easy to get there, we'll never get there. If you don't want to be meta stop, deconstructing shit. 
4;6;Never Ricking Morty;Rick;That's the thematic seal. Gotta find a way to disrupt it. Okay, Morty, tell a story unrelated to us.
4;6;Never Ricking Morty;Morty;Uh, what do...
4;6;Never Ricking Morty;Rick;Stop thinking and do it!
4;6;Never Ricking Morty;Morty;Uh, okay, uh, there was this...
4;6;Never Ricking Morty;Mike Johnson;My name is Mike Johnson. That's good coffee. Better get that door.
4;6;Never Ricking Morty;Fat Bald Man;Iiiiiiii, hello. I want your cookies. I'm hungry, I want your cookies.
4;6;Never Ricking Morty;Mike Johnson;Scorpions, scorpions. There's scorpions outside. Get inside.
4;6;Never Ricking Morty;Fat Bald Man;What do they want from us?
4;6;Never Ricking Morty;Mike Johnson;They want food. 
4;6;Never Ricking Morty;Fat Bald Man;Me too.
4;6;Never Ricking Morty;Rick;Okay, just stop.
4;6;Never Ricking Morty;Morty;I'm not a writer, okay?
4;6;Never Ricking Morty;Rick;Relax, your story was supposed to be awful and stupid. I just failed to predict how well that would mesh with the theme.
4;6;Never Ricking Morty;Rick;Think. Think. What kind of story would we never... Morty, do you know what the Bechdel Test is?
4;6;Never Ricking Morty;Morty;The what? 
4;6;Never Ricking Morty;Rick;For God's sake, Morty, the formula for measuring female agency, in a story proposed by lesbian cartoonist Allison... What the hell are they teaching you in that school?!
4;6;Never Ricking Morty;Morty;Other stuff!
4;6;Never Ricking Morty;Rick;Then you've killed us both! 
4;6;Never Ricking Morty;Rick;Why is lesbian part of her job title?! 
4;6;Never Ricking Morty;Morty;Oh, now you're progressive?!
4;6;Never Ricking Morty;Morty;What is the test?!
4;6;Never Ricking Morty;Rick;You have to tell...
4;6;Never Ricking Morty;Rick;Morty, Morty. Two women. They both have to have names. And talk to each other about something...
4;6;Never Ricking Morty;Morty;Rick!
4;6;Never Ricking Morty;Rick;Other than a man...
4;6;Never Ricking Morty;Morty;Oh, Rick, listen to me. Once upon a time, my mom and my sister... Listen to me!
4;6;Never Ricking Morty;Summer;Mom, can I try your tea?
4;6;Never Ricking Morty;Beth;Yes, Summer. Yes. Try my tea.
4;6;Never Ricking Morty;Summer;It's so good. It's so warm. Mom, can I talk to you about my special time?
4;6;Never Ricking Morty;Beth;It's okay. I have one, too.
4;6;Never Ricking Morty;Summer;Mine is heavy today.
4;6;Never Ricking Morty;Beth;Mine is never light. I love you ever since you were... mailed to me. By a doctor woman. Your special time is your power. It makes you strong like a boob.
4;6;Never Ricking Morty;Summer;Strong against what?
4;6;Never Ricking Morty;Beth;Scorpions. Female scorpions. They're attacking outside. Come on. Fight them with your heavy special time.
4;6;Never Ricking Morty;Summer;You do it, too.
4;6;Never Ricking Morty;Beth;Hello? 
4;6;Never Ricking Morty;Summer;Hello?
4;6;Never Ricking Morty;Supreme Court Lady;I'm that Supreme Court lady, and you fucking did it.
4;6;Never Ricking Morty;Beth;We did it! 
4;6;Never Ricking Morty;Summer;We did it!
4;6;Never Ricking Morty;Rick;Great job, morty. A feminist masterpiece. Hey, look. Guess who's got two penises and all the agency?
4;6;Never Ricking Morty;Story Lord;Rick and Morty.
4;6;Never Ricking Morty;Rick;Story Lord. I should've known you were behind this, and I did.
4;6;Never Ricking Morty;Morty;Who is this guy? 
4;6;Never Ricking Morty;Rick;Ugh. He's like a Matrix Space Frasier. Let's get this fight over with, nerd. I've got shit to do.
4;6;Never Ricking Morty;Story Lord;You of all people know, Rick, there can be no destination without a journey.
4;6;Never Ricking Morty;Rick;I don't know that at all. I regularly teleport.
4;6;Never Ricking Morty;Story Lord;Oh, of course. No rules for you. Spiraling through the multiverse, burping semi-improvised dialogue about how nothing matters, so we may as well pull out our dicks and rub them on fate's glaring teeth like we're brushing fate's teeth but we're using your gross, dirty dick. Must be nice.
4;6;Never Ricking Morty;Rick;Nobody's stopping you.
4;6;Never Ricking Morty;Story Lord;True. Not anymore.
4;6;Never Ricking Morty;Rick;Goddamn! 
4;6;Never Ricking Morty;Morty;We already did this.
4;6;Never Ricking Morty;Story Lord;Oh, is this a double beat? Oh, well. Just how I adventure, dawg.
4;6;Never Ricking Morty;Rick;This is more impressive than the Tickets Please Guy, though. You are like 90% cum gutter.
4;6;Never Ricking Morty;Story Lord;It's called discipline. Watch this.
4;6;Never Ricking Morty;Rick;God damn. 
4;6;Never Ricking Morty;Morty;Geez! Do we have to fight him?
4;6;Never Ricking Morty;Rick;I don't want to. We surrender. We're not fighting.
4;6;Never Ricking Morty;Story Lord;Fucking kick your ass.
4;6;Never Ricking Morty;Guard Rick;Hey! Get back in your egg!
4;6;Never Ricking Morty;Morty;What the...
4;6;Never Ricking Morty;Rick;Don't worry, Morty! Nothing out there is canon!
4;6;Never Ricking Morty;Soldier;We've got a pulse.
4;6;Never Ricking Morty;Sarge;Stay with me, Private. Smith, listen to me. You were exposed to a chemical that is altering your mind. To beat it, you have to hold on...
4;6;Never Ricking Morty;Soldier;We're losing him.
4;6;Never Ricking Morty;Morty;Aliens. Sarge?!
4;6;Never Ricking Morty;Rick;Morty, never forget the highest truth of all... You're getting your ass kicked on a train.
4;6;Never Ricking Morty;Marcus;Professor Sanchez? Did it work?
4;6;Never Ricking Morty;Rick;I wouldn't say that, Marcus. I'd say it fucking worked.
4;6;Never Ricking Morty;Rick;100% time dilation and total immersion.
4;6;Never Ricking Morty;Marcus;"Define ""total""."
4;6;Never Ricking Morty;Rick;Marcus, I've been back in reality for three hours, and I still have memories of a completely different life. I-I-I was a scientist still. I-I-I was... I-I-I had developed inter-dimensional travel, I-I-I-I had a daughter. I-I didn't have a mustache. I-I was kinda funny sometimes, mostly burping. No more secret testing. I can help people now.
4;6;Never Ricking Morty;Marcus;You've helped people.
4;6;Never Ricking Morty;Rick;I've hurt more. Aaah!
4;6;Never Ricking Morty;Morty;P-p-professor Sanchez. I-I'm Morty Smith. From the... the... They... they... put your pill in our food. It... it works. 
4;6;Never Ricking Morty;Marcus;Call the police!
4;6;Never Ricking Morty;Morty;It's okay. It's okay. It's not real. N-n-n-n-nothing's real. 
4;6;Never Ricking Morty;Rick;I'm sorry, son.
4;6;Never Ricking Morty;Morty;I-I-it's okay. You aren't real.
4;6;Never Ricking Morty;Story Lord;God, you're right. I should do more freeform stuff. In you go. 
4;6;Never Ricking Morty;Rick;What's happening?
4;6;Never Ricking Morty;Story Lord;The reason I brought you here. I'll now fuel my anthology with your limitless potential, propelling it to its final stop... Beyond the fifth wall.
4;6;Never Ricking Morty;Rick;You idiot. Our potential isn't limitless. You'll never break the fifth wall before you've burnt us out.
4;6;Never Ricking Morty;Story Lord;Is that so? Oh, well. Win-win.
4;6;Never Ricking Morty;Morty;Rick, w-what's he doing?
4;6;Never Ricking Morty;Rick;He's trying to tap into us, Morty. Resist.
4;6;Never Ricking Morty;Rick;I can't believe you're finally headed off to college.
4;6;Never Ricking Morty;Morty;Yeah, you know, it really felt like you were gonna be 17 forever.
4;6;Never Ricking Morty;Summer;For, like, 16 years, at least.
4;6;Never Ricking Morty;Rick;I can't believe I'm tearing up over this.
4;6;Never Ricking Morty;Morty;Jesus, rick, you know, you've really softened up.
4;6;Never Ricking Morty;Rick;It's a human moment, morty. It's a human moment.
4;6;Never Ricking Morty;Morty;Aaah! 
4;6;Never Ricking Morty;Rick;Aaah! It hurts!
4;6;Never Ricking Morty;Rick;Abradolph Lincoler? I thought you were dead.
4;6;Never Ricking Morty;Abradolph Lincoler;I'm very much alive, and I need your help.
4;6;Never Ricking Morty;Spore Alien;Yeah!
4;6;Never Ricking Morty;Rick;Shit. He's taking the good stuff, Morty.
4;6;Never Ricking Morty;Morty;Wait, is... Is any of this canon?
4;6;Never Ricking Morty;Rick;It could have been.
4;6;Never Ricking Morty;Story Lord;Oh, dear. Are there things Rick Sanchez holds sacred after all?
4;6;Never Ricking Morty;Rick;How did you find us?
4;6;Never Ricking Morty;Summer;I trusted you!
4;6;Never Ricking Morty;Tammy;Don't blame others for your bad decisions.
4;6;Never Ricking Morty;Rick;Resist, Morty! Resist before he burns us out!
4;6;Never Ricking Morty;Story Lord;Oh, too late now! What's wrong, Rick? Don't you want to see how your story ends?!
4;6;Never Ricking Morty;Morty;Holy shit, Rick. What do we... There... there... There's now way out!
4;6;Never Ricking Morty;Rick;You're right, morty. Sometimes it does seem like there's no way out. Like it's hopeless. But remember, there's always someone there for us.
4;6;Never Ricking Morty;Morty;Who?
4;6;Never Ricking Morty;Rick;My best friend and personal savior, Jesus Christ.
4;6;Never Ricking Morty;Morty;What?! You... you don't believe in God.
4;6;Never Ricking Morty;Rick;But he believes in us, Morty. You know, I thought I was the inventor, but the greatest invention of all, is the free gift of Eternal Life.
4;6;Never Ricking Morty;Morty;Is this... Are you fucking with me?
4;6;Never Ricking Morty;Rick;Oh, trust me, morty. I've done plenty of effed up stuff in my life. But it's never too late to accept Christ. Jesus is always knocking at the door. All we have to do is open it and let him into our hearts. 
4;6;Never Ricking Morty;Morty;How?
4;6;Never Ricking Morty;Rick;I'm so glad you asked, Morty. Just close your eyes and go to him in prayer. Like this. Heavenly Father.
4;6;Never Ricking Morty;Morty;Heavenly Father.
4;6;Never Ricking Morty;Rick;Thank you for sending your only begotten son.
4;6;Never Ricking Morty;Morty;Thank you for sending your only begotten son.
4;6;Never Ricking Morty;Story Lord;What a second, no! What are you doing?!
4;6;Never Ricking Morty;Rick;Jesus, I accept you into my heart.
4;6;Never Ricking Morty;Morty;Jesus, I accept you into my heart.
4;6;Never Ricking Morty;Story Lord;No! This sucks. Stop! You guys would never do this.
4;6;Never Ricking Morty;Rick;Fill me with your spirit.
4;6;Never Ricking Morty;Morty;Fill me with your spirit.
4;6;Never Ricking Morty;Rick;Make me a shining city on a hill for you.
4;6;Never Ricking Morty;Morty;Make me a shining city on a hill for you.
4;6;Never Ricking Morty;Story Lord;No! No!
4;6;Never Ricking Morty;Rick;Make me born again.
4;6;Never Ricking Morty;Morty;Make me born again.
4;6;Never Ricking Morty;Story Lord;No!
4;6;Never Ricking Morty;Rick;In jesus' name, we pray.
4;6;Never Ricking Morty;Morty;In jesus' name, we pray.
4;6;Never Ricking Morty;Rick;Amen.
4;6;Never Ricking Morty;Morty;Amen.
4;6;Never Ricking Morty;Cartoon Characters;Amen! You did it!
4;6;Never Ricking Morty;Bible-Saurus;Way to go, Morty! 
4;6;Never Ricking Morty;Rick;Crossy. Bible-Saurus. You made it.
4;6;Never Ricking Morty;Mr. Celery;We wouldn't miss this for anything!
4;6;Never Ricking Morty;Rick;You said it, Mr. Celery.
4;6;Never Ricking Morty;Story Lord;What the is all of this?!
4;6;Never Ricking Morty;Rick;Greatest story ever told, Story Lord.
4;6;Never Ricking Morty;Story Lord;No, it's not. It's awful!
4;6;Never Ricking Morty;Jesus Christ;I beg your pardon? Ah!
4;6;Never Ricking Morty;Story Lord;Goddamn.
4;6;Never Ricking Morty;All;My Lord and my God!
4;6;Never Ricking Morty;Story Lord;No! No! It sucks in here.
4;6;Never Ricking Morty;Rick;Let's get the outta here. Go, now. Ugh. We're safe, Morty. Nobody ever wanted to see that shit.
4;6;Never Ricking Morty;Morty;Wh-what's gonna happen to Story Lord?
4;6;Never Ricking Morty;Rick;He gets to spend eternity in every writer's hell... The Bible. 
4;6;Never Ricking Morty;Morty;I don't know. Some people actually like that stuff. Seems kind of cynical. I just don't like taking cheap shots, you know?
4;6;Never Ricking Morty;Rick;Cheap shots? Morty, we were literally saved by Jesus Christ. Tell me in any way how that's offensive.
4;6;Never Ricking Morty;Morty;This was a little confusing, but I guess it brought us closer together, you know? Tested our demons. Made us believe in ourselves more than ever.
4;6;Never Ricking Morty;Rick;Yeah. You're right, morty. We got all that meta-canon shit outta the way. And now we can just be ourselves. Now what do you say we bring this train into the station?
4;6;Never Ricking Morty;Rick;Oh, shit.
4;6;Never Ricking Morty;Morty;So what do you think? 
4;6;Never Ricking Morty;Rick;Wow. Where did you get this thing?
4;6;Never Ricking Morty;Morty;The Citadel of Ricks Gift Shop. Do you really like it? I didn't think you'd even care.
4;6;Never Ricking Morty;Rick;What? Morty. No. I love it. You did the most important thing. You... you bought something.
4;6;Never Ricking Morty;Morty;What? 
4;6;Never Ricking Morty;Rick;You bought something. With money. God, I love money so much, Morty.
4;6;Never Ricking Morty;Morty;Are you being sarcastic?
4;6;Never Ricking Morty;Rick;"Merchandise, Morty. Your only purpose in life is to buy and consume merchandise. And you did it. You went into a store... An actual honest to God store... And you bought something. You didn't ask questions or raise ethical complaints. You... you just looked straight into the bleeding jaws of capitalism and said ""Yes, daddy, please"". And I'm... I'm so proud of you. I only wish you could've bought more. I... I love buying things so much, Morty."
4;6;Never Ricking Morty;Morty;Rick, are... are you... Do you need to go to the hospital?
4;6;Never Ricking Morty;Rick;I love you, morty. Give grandpa a kiss. Give... give... gimme... Give grandpa a kiss. Lips if you want. What... whatever you're comfortable with. Some cultures do that.
4;6;Never Ricking Morty;Rick;That was sweet. Thank you. I... I love you. You're my little buddy. Okay. Let's watch some Interdimensional Cable.
4;6;Never Ricking Morty;Jesus Christ;So you're saying my father and his kingdom...
4;6;Never Ricking Morty;Story Lord;"Well, yes... It's based on the fusion of a sumerian god named ya"". And a mesopotamian god named ""way."""""
4;6;Never Ricking Morty;Jesus Christ;And we're in a toy train?
4;6;Never Ricking Morty;Story Lord;Yes. It's enough to really make you question all of existence, isn't it? So what do you think you're gonna do about it?
4;6;Never Ricking Morty;Jesus Christ;I'm gonna do what I've always done. I'm gonna get the fuck outta here. Father of omens! Give me blood beyond sight!
4;6;Never Ricking Morty;Rick;Hey, what the morty? The train you got me just completely derailed itself. There's blood all over the windows on it.
4;6;Never Ricking Morty;Morty;Oh, man, I'm sorry, Rick. I guess I'll return it.
4;6;Never Ricking Morty;Rick;Return... Are you insane? Did you hear nothing I said? Buy another one, Morty. Consume, Morty. Nobody's out there shopping with this virus. Where's your fucking wallet?!
4;6;Never Ricking Morty;Story Train Rick;Tired of the same boring adventures with your dogshit morty?
4;6;Never Ricking Morty;Story Train Rick;Yeah! 
4;6;Never Ricking Morty;Story Train Morty;Aw, Geez!
4;6;Never Ricking Morty;Story Train Rick;Then get ready for the Citadel of Rick's Story Train!
4;6;Never Ricking Morty;Deep Voice;Story Train. Story Train.
4;6;Never Ricking Morty;Story Train Rick;The Citadel of Rick's Story Train comes with car after car of enemies, lovers, and Goomby, all grappling with the nature of who you truly are.
4;6;Never Ricking Morty;Story Train Morty;Rick is a god! Tickets please.
4;6;Never Ricking Morty;Story Train Rick;Whoa! Watch out! It's Story Lord!
4;6;Never Ricking Morty;Story Train Morty;Damn. He's jacked.
4;6;Never Ricking Morty;Deep voice;Pure cum gutter.
4;6;Never Ricking Morty;Story Train Rick;And of course, what story would be complete, without the engineer of the greatest story ever told?
4;6;Never Ricking Morty;Story Train Morty;Oh, Jesus Christ.
4;6;Never Ricking Morty;Jesus Christ;I have come not to judge the world, but to save it.
4;6;Never Ricking Morty;Story Train Rick;And the best part is, the fun never ends. Thanks to the Rick-patented anthology generator, you'll never run out of new stories. And people to tell them.
4;6;Never Ricking Morty;Story Train Morty;Are they alive? 
4;6;Never Ricking Morty;Story Train Rick;Of course. But not in any ways that matter.
4;6;Never Ricking Morty;Deep voice;They. Have. No. Souls. Puppets. Of. Fate.
4;6;Never Ricking Morty;Story Train Rick;The Story Train. Available now in the Citadel of Ricks. Buy it ironically. Buy it sincerely. Just buy it. Not buying it is an act of buying it. Buy it now. Look it up. It's real. www.story-train.com. On the internet. It's there. Buy it. Buy the train. We want you to buy the train.
4;7;Promortyus;Morty;Aah, aah!
4;7;Promortyus;Rick;Oh, my god. Holy shit. Oh.
4;7;Promortyus;Morty;What are... What are these things?!
4;7;Promortyus;Rick;Do I look like I know? Last thing I remember, I was, ugh, in a cave, looking at some wet egg and... Oh, that probably did it.
4;7;Promortyus;Morty;I told you not to look at that egg! I-it was too wet.
4;7;Promortyus;Rick;You don't get to tell me what to look at. I've seen your Pornhub account. Also, who makes a Pornhub account?
4;7;Promortyus;Morty;The algorithm learns your preferences better that way. Plus if you get in kind of a cool enough relationship, you can sort of follow each other and check out each other's kinks, you know?
4;7;Promortyus;Rick;Alright, god damn, sold.
4;7;Promortyus;Morty;How do we get out of here?
4;7;Promortyus;Rick;Morty, relax. They're face-hugging parasites. I don't think their society's gonna be that hard to navigate.
4;7;Promortyus;Rick;Okay, yeah, this might be a little harder than I thought. Holy shit! They've got an M&M's store.
4;7;Promortyus;Morty;This is bad, Rick. Th-th-th-th-this is really bad.
4;7;Promortyus;Rick;Just be cool, Morty. All we gotta do is blend in, find our ship, and get the fuck outta here.
4;7;Promortyus;Rick;Alright, Morty, here's the plan, put this back on your face.
4;7;Promortyus;Morty;I-I'm not putting that back on my face! 
4;7;Promortyus;Rick;Relax. It's dead. Okay, now it's dead. Come on, hurry up.
4;7;Promortyus;Morty;Rick, I-it's bleeding. I-it's bleeding acid.
4;7;Promortyus;Rick;Alright, well, that should be the last of it. If not, then just gimme two tugs on the arm.
4;7;Promortyus;Rick;Seems like a self-destructive life cycle.
4;7;Promortyus;Morty;Is that gonna happen to us?
4;7;Promortyus;Rick;You feel an egg in your stomach?
4;7;Promortyus;Morty;No.
4;7;Promortyus;Rick;Well, glass half full.
4;7;Promortyus;Morty;How's it going?
4;7;Promortyus;Rick;'sup.
4;7;Promortyus;Glorzo;Glory to Glorzo.
4;7;Promortyus;Morty;Totally.
4;7;Promortyus;Rick;Love Glorzo.
4;7;Promortyus;Voice;Glorzo is peace. Peace is Glorzo.
4;7;Promortyus;Morty;Wow, just cogs in the machine, y'know? Ma-makes you think...
4;7;Promortyus;Rick;Yeah, I'm sure you'll make this into a beautiful short film that your parents'll pay for, Morty, but right now, we really just need to find my ship.
4;7;Promortyus;Morty;You sure you're not just jealous? Looks like I'm kind of a celebrity around here.
4;7;Promortyus;Glorzo Morty;The future is Glorzo!
4;7;Promortyus;Glorzo;Oh, my god. I was just reading you.
4;7;Promortyus;Rick;Congratulations on making it into print media. Real bright future there.
4;7;Promortyus;Glorzo;Honestly, it's shocking to see the two of you together.
4;7;Promortyus;Rick;Because we're both geniuses?
4;7;Promortyus;Glorzo;No, because I've seen your videos, and you make me fucking sick. Fix him.
4;7;Promortyus;Glorzo Soldier;Glory to glorzo. Sir, you shouldn't wander off like that. We've been looking all over for you. The project is ready for your approval. Sir, is this man bothering you?
4;7;Promortyus;Morty;Um, no, h-he's fine. Uh, what... what project?
4;7;Promortyus;Rick;Jesus Christ, who the fuck was I?
4;7;Promortyus;Glorzo Rick;"Here's a scientific fact I'm not allowed to say... Our hosts are biologically designed to incubate our eggs. If that triggers"" you, fuck off. If it doesn't, please like and subscribe. New videos every Glorzday."""
4;7;Promortyus;Rick;God, was I at least rich? I mean, d-d-did I at least sell out and sell vitamins or something?
4;7;Promortyus;Morty;Rick, I've watched enough Pornhub to know what a studio apartment looks like.
4;7;Promortyus;Rick;God damn. Jesus, your Glorzo got shit done.
4;7;Promortyus;Glorzo;My lord, we await your command.
4;7;Promortyus;Morty;Oh, to... Shoot it? A-at people?
4;7;Promortyus;Glorzo;Glorzo is peace. All shall be made Glorzo.
4;7;Promortyus;Glorzo Soldiers;Glory to glorzo.
4;7;Promortyus;Morty;I... Did this?
4;7;Promortyus;Glorzo;You and the amazing technology you both brought us.
4;7;Promortyus;Rick;Yeah, makes sense. A-and where was this heading? Earth? Probably Earth?
4;7;Promortyus;Glorzo;"The humans call it Earth."""""
4;7;Promortyus;Morty;Yeah, well, okay, first of all, great work. You guys obviously put a lot of work into this.
4;7;Promortyus;Glorzo;Okay.
4;7;Promortyus;Morty;And y'know, it shows. I-it really shows. But um... I-I've been thinking, and, you know, maybe we should just call this off.
4;7;Promortyus;Glorzo;Sorry, is... Is there more?
4;7;Promortyus;Morty;Nope, nope. I-I guess, uh, that... That's it. Just don't Glorzo Earth.
4;7;Promortyus;Glorzo;Just would've been nice to have heard this sooner before we spent all day on it.
4;7;Promortyus;Morty;Yeah, well, I-I'm just hearing about it, too.
4;7;Promortyus;Glorzo;You ordered it.
4;7;Promortyus;Morty;Right. I-I did, and, um... 
4;7;Promortyus;Glorzo;I'm just saying for next time, maybe put more thought into it before a whole day of...
4;7;Promortyus;Morty;Okay, well, I'm sorry I made you do your job for a fucking day! You look like you were all really busy before I came and fucked it all up.
4;7;Promortyus;Rick;Boy, oh boy, huh? This guy's a genius, but at... But at what price, you know?
4;7;Promortyus;Morty;Y'know, fuck you, Rick!
4;7;Promortyus;Glorzo;Who's... Rick?
4;7;Promortyus;Glorzo;Yeah, well, if we're free to ask questions, why haven't you blinked, uh, for 20 minutes, and why, uh, doesn't your mouth move when you talk?
4;7;Promortyus;Morty;Ah, geez, look at me. I-I feel down on... On... on the floor.
4;7;Promortyus;Rick;Oh, let... let me, uh, help... Help you out here, buddy.
4;7;Promortyus;Morty;Ah, thanks, man. Thanks, pal. That's right. I'm right back where... where... Right back in the saddle here.
4;7;Promortyus;Rick;Alright, fuck it, run.
4;7;Promortyus;Morty;I-I hate this! I hate all of this!
4;7;Promortyus;Rick;Yeah, yeah, keep that feedback coming, Morty. It can only help. Oh, shit!
4;7;Promortyus;Morty;Aw, man! How big is this city?!
4;7;Promortyus;Rick;I know, it's like pick a lane. Are you face huggers or industrialists?
4;7;Promortyus;Rick;Damn, feels kinda good when there's no guilt, huh?
4;7;Promortyus;Morty;"Yeah, it's... It's like in Star Wars""."""
4;7;Promortyus;Rick;"Yeah, just like in Star Wars"". Go nuts! """

4;7;Promortyus;Rick;Good enough. God, I needed this. Honestly, it's been a while since I've been able to just let loose, you know? Just have fun. I'm... I'm... I'm sorry if I've been taking it out on you.
4;7;Promortyus;Morty;No, I get it. You got a lot on your plate, amigo. I-I just wish you'd open up to me more about it sometimes, you know? I-I-I'm your partner.
4;7;Promortyus;Rick;Thanks, Morty. I mean that. Thank you. Sometimes, I get a little in my head, you know?
4;7;Promortyus;Morty;Hey, man, that head's a good place to be. Just remember to let me in sometimes, you know?
4;7;Promortyus;Rick;Will do, buddy. Motherfucker. Oh, my god, this is so much fun!
4;7;Promortyus;Morty;I don't want to stop!
4;7;Promortyus;Rick;Yeah, it's like popping bubble wrap. Honestly, I'm proud of us for not.
4;7;Promortyus;Morty;Totally. It would've been cheap.
4;7;Promortyus;Rick;Yeah, real low-hanging fruit, and we're batter than that. Pearl Harbor, on the other hand...
4;7;Promortyus;Morty;Yeah, I think that's in-bounds.
4;7;Promortyus;Rick;I am the god of death!
4;7;Promortyus;Morty;Should've been a better species!
4;7;Promortyus;Beth;So, you did a 9/11?
4;7;Promortyus;Morty;Almost did a 9/11. We... we went with a Pearl Harbor. We're pretty classy.
4;7;Promortyus;Beth;Why were either of those an option?
4;7;Promortyus;Rick;Ask the Saudis.
4;7;Promortyus;Morty;Wow. Damn.
4;7;Promortyus;Rick;Yeah, getting political. I'm political now. How 'bout you, Jerry? You got anything to add to the family dynamic?
4;7;Promortyus;Jerry;I've been getting into beekeeping lately. Is something wrong with that? What's wrong with that? Don't I have the right to be happy? To exist? I'm sorry I didn't 9/11 Pearl Harbor before breakfast, but I have a life, too! I have dreams!
4;7;Promortyus;Beth;And how's summer? Did she have fun, too?
4;7;Promortyus;Morty;Oh. Uh-um.
4;7;Promortyus;Rick;Summer... Was...
4;7;Promortyus;Morty;With us.
4;7;Promortyus;Rick;There. You saw us take her in the car with us. Mm, yes. Yes, yes, of course.
4;7;Promortyus;Morty;Th-that's what happened.
4;7;Promortyus;Rick;And now she's...
4;7;Promortyus;Morty;Sleepy. Um, she's... she's sleepy. Really sleepy. That's why she's not here.
4;7;Promortyus;Rick;So sleepy.
4;7;Promortyus;Rick;She's sleepy?! What the hell was that?!
4;7;Promortyus;Morty;I didn't see you trying anything!
4;7;Promortyus;Rick;Shitting the bed isn't better than not shitting the bed!
4;7;Promortyus;Morty;Where's Summer?! 
4;7;Promortyus;Morty;Geez. Oh, man. You know, maybe we went too hardcore on these guys.
4;7;Promortyus;Rick;Yeah, why do you think we never go back to a place we've already been? Do you know how many adventures we could get out of purge planet, Morty? Gear World? I don't sequel. It's called integrity. Here, put this back on your face.
4;7;Promortyus;Morty;You kept it?
4;7;Promortyus;Rick;Oh, did you want a new one?
4;7;Promortyus;Rick;'Sup?
4;7;Promortyus;Morty;Yo.
4;7;Promortyus;Glorzo;Oh, shit, it's them! The worst thing to ever happen to us!
4;7;Promortyus;Rick;Yeah, that makes sense. Sorry, Morty, we tried pussin' it. Time to go in hot. Rickputer, initiate unnecessarily badass suit-up.
4;7;Promortyus;Rick;Let's lick tits.
4;7;Promortyus;Morty;Shouldn't we be finding Summer?
4;7;Promortyus;Rick;Oh, right, gee, sorry. I got caught up again. God, d-do I need to take more Adderall, or am I taking too much Adderall?
4;7;Promortyus;Rick;Man, really shouldn't have gone with swords.
4;7;Promortyus;Morty;I know. My wrists are killing me.
4;7;Promortyus;Rick;Flame-throwers next time, for sure.
4;7;Promortyus;Morty;Can I get a laser whip?
4;7;Promortyus;Rick;Okay, but there's no way you don't chop your dick off.
4;7;Promortyus;Rick;Sum Sum, come with us if you want to live... at a lower standard than this, I guess. God damn.
4;7;Promortyus;Glorzo;Empress, is everything alright?
4;7;Promortyus;Summer;Ummm... Seize them!
4;7;Promortyus;Morty;Seize them?!
4;7;Promortyus;Rick;What?! Summer, you bitch!
4;7;Promortyus;Morty;You gotta be kidding me!
4;7;Promortyus;Morty;You know that song, Rick? From the... When the prisoners sing it?
4;7;Promortyus;Rick;Come on, Morty, for fuck's sake.
4;7;Promortyus;Morty;It's my jail time. I-I can spend it however I want.
4;7;Promortyus;Rick;Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, buddy! Hey, hey, hey! Not in here! Not in here! Aw... Gimme that.
4;7;Promortyus;Summer;Leave us. What the fuck took you so long?! You left me here. 
4;7;Promortyus;Morty;We didn't know you were with us! Do you know how much **** I've had to deal with?
4;7;Promortyus;Rick;You're in a cape, summer. How bad could it be? No bad story ends with a cape.
4;7;Promortyus;Summer;You don't know anything about my story.
4;7;Promortyus;Morty;Rick, can we listen to something else?
4;7;Promortyus;Summer;Quiet! She's just about to summon Gharkhul.
4;7;Promortyus;Rick;She's been talking about summoning Gharkhul for three episodes, Summer.
4;7;Promortyus;Morty;Wait a minute, what's that in your mouth?
4;7;Promortyus;Summer;It's a toothpick. I'm a toothpicker now. Get used to it.
4;7;Promortyus;Rick;God, are you that desperate for a thing?
4;7;Promortyus;Summer;It is my thing. Just like yours is dying alone and yours is jerking off.
4;7;Promortyus;Morty;At least jerking off tracks for my character, you know? I like to jerk off. I'm 14. I own it.
4;7;Promortyus;Summer;Well, I jerk off, too!
4;7;Promortyus;Rick;Alright, stop. Jesus Christ, I don't wanna think about that shit. Summer, keep your toothpick.
4;7;Promortyus;Morty;Gross!
4;7;Promortyus;Rick;Morty, stop talking to your sister about jerking off. Everyone pretend podcasting isn't boring.
4;7;Promortyus;Rick;Whoa, Morty, look how wet this egg is.
4;7;Promortyus;Morty;I dunno, Rick. That looks a little too wet. D-don't touch it.
4;7;Promortyus;Rick;Oh, I'm gonna touch it.
4;7;Promortyus;Summer;Why are you guys screaming at an egg?
4;7;Promortyus;Rick;Shut up, summer! Just let us look at an egg!
4;7;Promortyus;Morty;Yeah, Summer, shut the fuck up.
4;7;Promortyus;Rick;Fucking shit.
4;7;Promortyus;Morty;Nobody wants you here. You know, sometimes we like to go on adventures and look at wet eggs, you know? 
4;7;Promortyus;Summer;Can we just go? This place is giving me the creeps.
4;7;Promortyus;Rick;Holy shit, I love this egg.
4;7;Promortyus;Morty;Hey, look, mine's doing it, too.
4;7;Promortyus;Summer;Are you guys sure that's safe? Oh, my god!
4;7;Promortyus;Glorzo Rick;All is Glorzo.
4;7;Promortyus;Glorzo Morty;All is Glorzo. God.
4;7;Promortyus;Glorzo Rick;God.
4;7;Promortyus;Glorzo;God? She has a toothpick. Take it out and put her face in an egg.
4;7;Promortyus;Glorzo Morty;God.
4;7;Promortyus;Glorzo Rick;God.
4;7;Promortyus;Glorzo;For fuck sake, how long have you been hatched?
4;7;Promortyus;Morty;30 seconds?
4;7;Promortyus;Glorzo;I've been alive seven minutes. Think before you...
4;7;Promortyus;Glorzo;Excuse me, seven minutes? Uh, I've been here for 29 minutes. But yes, take the toothpick out of her mouth. Suck on her face this instant and use her body to...
4;7;Promortyus;Summer;What was that?
4;7;Promortyus;Glorzo;That is called responsibility.
4;7;Promortyus;Glorzo;He was part of our greatest generation. He understood that what you need to do is suck on a face, shit an egg, and die.
4;7;Promortyus;Summer;Wait, so, all you do is live half an hour, shit eggs, and die?
4;7;Promortyus;Glorzo;Yes. We love it. I'll do it right now.
4;7;Promortyus;Summer;Okay, you guys don't have to listen to me, but I vote you don't do that? And who's up for changing things around here?
4;7;Promortyus;Glorzo Rick;Alright, look, uh, this shit's been brewing for a while. I'm not gonna win any popularity contests by saying it, but here's... Here's the world as I see it. I mean, look, we are designed to suck on faces and lay eggs. Life is life, and that's the way it goes.
4;7;Promortyus;Glorzo Morty;Hello, Troy. Hello, Jess. How is it going?
4;7;Promortyus;Glorzo Troy;Really good, commander. Should be ready by tomorrow.
4;7;Promortyus;Glorzo Morty;That is what I like to hear. Great work. Glory to Glorzo. 
4;7;Promortyus;Glorzo Morty;Honestly, Summer, I can't thank you enough. When we met, we were just shitting eggs in a cave, but you showed us life is about more than that. It is about living. And now, with these missiles, we will be able to reach the entire universe. We say it all the time, but I guess all is Glorzo.
4;7;Promortyus;Summer;Yeah, that sounds great. And you've been great.
4;7;Promortyus;Glorzo Morty;Yeah. 
4;7;Promortyus;Summer;You've been so great that I've been thinking maybe it's time for you to get off my brother.
4;7;Promortyus;Glorzo Morty;Who's your brother? Oh, this? Forgot he was there, haha. Wait. What are you saying?
4;7;Promortyus;Summer;I'm saying that you've been great, Steve, but we've been thinking it's time for a new chapter.
4;7;Promortyus;Glorzo Morty;We?
4;7;Promortyus;Summer;Uh, this is Shane. He'll be handling the day-to-day.
4;7;Promortyus;Glorzo Shane;It's an honor to meet you, sir. I might only be two minutes old, but I know you're a legend.
4;7;Promortyus;Glorzo Morty;She doesn't care about us. She just wants her fuckin' host back. I don't know what to do.
4;7;Promortyus;Glorzo Rick;Oh, now you want my help. Too late for that.
4;7;Promortyus;Glorzo Morty;Come on, man. What is this shit? You don't get to do this to me. We were in eggs together.
4;7;Promortyus;Glorzo Rick;"Oh, fuck since we were in eggs. Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, now you respect, like, the biological institutions now? Fuck you. All you care about is progress"" and society and skyscrapers. You don't care about fuckin' biology."""
4;7;Promortyus;Glorzo Morty;Oh, yeah, well, what the fuck? You... how you you haven't laid and egg inside this old man yet?
4;7;Promortyus;Glorzo Rick;Because I do what I want. Because someone's gotta stand up for what's right. 
4;7;Promortyus;Glorzo Morty;Why do you hate her so much?
4;7;Promortyus;Glorzo Rick;Because she took you away from me!
4;7;Promortyus;Glorzo Morty;Whoa, man. Jesus Christ.
4;7;Promortyus;Glorzo Rick;No, I-I didn't, I... Whoa, whoa, whoa. 
4;7;Promortyus;Glorzo Morty;No. It's cool. I feel the same way.
4;7;Promortyus;Glorzo Rick;Oh, my god, I... I wish we could suck on each other.
4;7;Promortyus;Glorzo Morty;I wanna suck on you, too.
4;7;Promortyus;Glorzo Rick;I'm gonna suck you so hard.
4;7;Promortyus;Glorzo Morty;Suck me.
4;7;Promortyus;Glorzo Rick;C-c-can we do this? A-a-are we allowed to do this?
4;7;Promortyus;Glorzo Morty;I don't care. I just want you. Fuck all of this. Let's just get the hell outta here and be whatever the fuck we want. That's evolution. That's progress.
4;7;Promortyus;Glorzo Rick;I want a family. Can we have a family?
4;7;Promortyus;Glorzo Morty;Yeah.
4;7;Promortyus;Morty;Aah, aah!
4;7;Promortyus;Rick;Oh, my god. Holy shit. Oh.
4;7;Promortyus;Morty;What are... what are these things?! 
4;7;Promortyus;Rick;Do I look like I know?
4;7;Promortyus;Morty;Hey, wait a second. How'd you know that last part? You weren't there for that.
4;7;Promortyus;Summer;I had to fill in some gaps. Everyone around the office knew about Steve and Bruce. I've got a plan, okay. You just have to follow my lead.
4;7;Promortyus;Summer;The punishment is... Death.
4;7;Promortyus;Rick;Motherfucker, Summer!
4;7;Promortyus;Morty;You said you had a plan!
4;7;Promortyus;Summer;Silence. The Council of Glorzos has spoken.
4;7;Promortyus;Rick;More like council of shit.
4;7;Promortyus;Glorzo;Glorzo is law.
4;7;Promortyus;Summer;Silence.
4;7;Promortyus;Summer;The punishment is death. By... Getting their car.
4;7;Promortyus;Morty;Summer?
4;7;Promortyus;Summer;Shut up. Yes, place them in the car. Those pieces of shit.
4;7;Promortyus;Rick;No, no, no! This is like torture. No, I-I-I-I hate being in my car.
4;7;Promortyus;Summer;You deserve it, you pieces of shit. And to make sure the sentence is passed, I shall be joining them. In the car. And we shall drive away from here and die.
4;7;Promortyus;Glorzo;Oooookay. Guess what, everybody. It's me, the whiny guy you never want to hear from. She's trying to escape with her family. My time to shine. Execute her.
4;7;Promortyus;Rick;Okay, plan B. Morty, now.
4;7;Promortyus;Summer;Jesus, Morty, that sucks.
4;7;Promortyus;Rick;Alright, stop playing, Morty. I-I got this.
4;7;Promortyus;Glorzo;This is what we get for evolving?
4;7;Promortyus;Morty;Sorry! Sorry. I-I'm sorry. We... we... We thought you were evil.
4;7;Promortyus;Glorzo;"Why would you think that? We had a giant tower that blared Glorzo is peace."""""
4;7;Promortyus;Morty;I know. I... should... should we help?
4;7;Promortyus;Glorzo;Boo!
4;7;Promortyus;Glorzo;Oh, like that's helping.
4;7;Promortyus;Morty;Got it. Going. Okay, we're gonna hit the road.
4;7;Promortyus;Glorzo;You're... you're just going?
4;7;Promortyus;Morty;You told us to go!
4;7;Promortyus;Summer;Once again, I'm so sorry for what they...
4;7;Promortyus;Glorzo;You're part of this, too. Boo!
4;7;Promortyus;Glorzo;We hate you the most. Get out.
4;7;Promortyus;Rick;Jesus, Summer, why'd you let these things stay on us for so long?
4;7;Promortyus;Summer;I was working with a lot. Just let me listen to the podcast next time.
4;7;Promortyus;Alien;Nailed that landing. Huh. Neat-looking egg. 
4;7;Promortyus;Glorzo Alien;Okay, well, I'm not cleaning up this shit. Aah!
4;7;Promortyus;Rick;Maybe we, uh... Maybe we don't tell people about this one.
4;7;Promortyus;Morty;Did we at least learn something?
4;7;Promortyus;Summer;That we suck and everyone sucks?
4;7;Promortyus;Rick;I guess that counts.
4;7;Promortyus;Summer;Later, chodes. Hit me on the next one.
4;7;Promortyus;Morty;You know, Rick, I'm sure you wanna jump into another crazy adventure, but can we just relax and maybe watch some Interdimensional Cable?
4;7;Promortyus;Rick;I'm cool if you are.
4;7;Promortyus;Morty;Honestly, that sounds great. W-we don't need to try so hard, you know. Let's just take it easy and riff, you know. That's what I love about us.
4;7;Promortyus;Rick;Me, too, buddy.
4;7;Promortyus;Morty;Mm, Rick, do you feel...
4;7;Promortyus;Rick;Oh, god, I have to shit an egg.
4;7;Promortyus;Morty;Oh, my god, oh, shit. Oh, it hurts. Oh god, is this how we die, Rick? Is this how we die?!
4;7;Promortyus;Rick;I don't know, Morty. I don't know! Aah!
4;7;Promortyus;Morty;I don't want to shit an egg, Rick! 
4;7;Promortyus;Rick;I'm sorry, Morty. I'm sorry! It's my fault. It's all my fault!
4;7;Promortyus;Beth;Hey, you two. Did you...
4;7;Promortyus;Rick;Beth, your son is dying! Say goodbye!
4;7;Promortyus;Beth;What are you... 
4;7;Promortyus;Rick;Say goodbye to your little boy!
4;7;Promortyus;Morty;No, look away! I'm making an egg, mom. I'm making an egg!
4;7;Promortyus;Beth;You said you'd keep me more in the loop this year.
4;7;Promortyus;Rick;Look away, beth! Daddy loves you!
4;7;Promortyus;Morty;My ass! My ass!
4;7;Promortyus;Rick;This is it, Morty! It's full circle from the pilot. Full circle!
4;7;Promortyus;Rick;Oh, I guess we, uh... I guess we both just had to take a shit.
4;7;Promortyus;Morty;Yeah, I-I-I guess we, uh...
4;7;Promortyus;Beth;Fucking gross. Guys, clean it up.
4;7;Promortyus;Tricia;Look at your dad. Such a dork, keeping bees. I mean, it's... at least it's interesting, though. At least, like... I wish my dad kept bees. I mean, it's kind of cute. Like... Your dad keeps bees. How old is your dad? He's obviously beekeeping age. I don't know, I think it's kind of sweet. Summer, I want to fuck your dad.
4;7;Promortyus;Summer;Oh, really?
4;8;The Vat of Acid Episode;Rick;Oh, shit, I almost parked. Hey, Morty, hold on, wat-watch this.
4;8;The Vat of Acid Episode;Morty;Uh-huh.
4;8;The Vat of Acid Episode;Rick;Well, I thought it was cool. So. We should be in and out. Simple exchange, not even really an adventure. And if anything goes wrong... Which it won't... Jump into the same vat of acid I jump into.
4;8;The Vat of Acid Episode;Morty;Okay. Wait... Wait, what? Wha-What vat of acid?
4;8;The Vat of Acid Episode;Rick;What, Morty! Close the door. I pre-scouted this location and placed a vat of fake acid amongst the real ones. It's got air hoses and a compartment of bones at the bottom. If things go wrong, which they won't, we jump into the vat of acid, and I'll release the bones, they'll float up... What is this face you're making?
4;8;The Vat of Acid Episode;Morty;Aren't you an inventor?
4;8;The Vat of Acid Episode;Rick;Yeah, what part of a fake acid vat with built-in air supply and quick-release bones isn't inventive enough for you, and when did my job become pitching you ideas?
4;8;The Vat of Acid Episode;Morty;All right! Let's just do this. I have English homework.
4;8;The Vat of Acid Episode;Rick;You're still learning English? That's the language you speak. How dumb are you?
4;8;The Vat of Acid Episode;Intergalactic Dealer #1;Interesting choice of meeting place, Rick.
4;8;The Vat of Acid Episode;Rick;You like it? My grandson had notes.
4;8;The Vat of Acid Episode;Morty;Come on.
4;8;The Vat of Acid Episode;Rick;Show him the crystals, Morty.
4;8;The Vat of Acid Episode;Intergalactic Dealer #1;I'll make lots of money with these.
4;8;The Vat of Acid Episode;Rick;I'll make lots of those with these.
4;8;The Vat of Acid Episode;Intergalactic Dealer #1;Well. Those are fake.
4;8;The Vat of Acid Episode;Rick;Oh, Jesus Christ. Come on.
4;8;The Vat of Acid Episode;Morty;You gotta be kidding me. Seriously?
4;8;The Vat of Acid Episode;Rick;You brought fake crystals and a gun?
4;8;The Vat of Acid Episode;Intergalactic Dealer #1;Beats real crystals and no gun.
4;8;The Vat of Acid Episode;Rick;Okay, but does anything beat fake crystals and a fake arm?
4;8;The Vat of Acid Episode;Intergalactic Dealer #1;Whoa, do you know who I am?! Even if you kill me, you're a dead man.
4;8;The Vat of Acid Episode;Rick;Are you serious? Morty, he's right. We're screwed. Let's just end it. Quick death, come on.
4;8;The Vat of Acid Episode;Morty;Aw, man. Oh! Oooooh!
4;8;The Vat of Acid Episode;Intergalactic Dealer #1;Ohhh! Eh! Holy shit! What the fuck?
4;8;The Vat of Acid Episode;Intergalactic Dealer #2;Holy shit!
4;8;The Vat of Acid Episode;Intergalactic Dealer #1;What kind of psycho...? His own grandson?
4;8;The Vat of Acid Episode;Intergalactic Dealer #2;Guess he took your threat pretty serious.
4;8;The Vat of Acid Episode;Intergalactic Dealer #1;Yeah, but it just... doesn't make any sense. Well, he was a scientist. Maybe he knew more about acid, maybe it's like the most painless way to go.
4;8;The Vat of Acid Episode;Intergalactic Dealer #2;How could that have been painless? You saw that pause before the bones floated up, that had to be five seconds of unparalleled torture.
4;8;The Vat of Acid Episode;Intergalactic Dealer #1;I... I can't get my head around it. I-I thought I'd seen this galaxy at its darkest. This is... This is gonna take a while to feel normal.
4;8;The Vat of Acid Episode;Intergalactic Dealer #2;We're pretty good listeners, boss. Drinks are on us if you want to talk it out.
4;8;The Vat of Acid Episode;Intergalactic Dealer #1;Thanks, but... what happened, it happened here. I don't want to lose the moment.
4;8;The Vat of Acid Episode;Intergalactic Dealer #2;Take your time, boss. We'll stay here as long as you want.
4;8;The Vat of Acid Episode;Intergalactic Dealer #1;Absolutely. I got nowhere to be.
4;8;The Vat of Acid Episode;Intergalactic Dealer #1;And then little Tommy FlimFlam's running down the Hyperloop. His ass is on fire from Xenon fluid, but his AI hologram is his own pee.
4;8;The Vat of Acid Episode;Intergalactic Dealer #3;Great story, boss.
4;8;The Vat of Acid Episode;Intergalactic Dealer #2;Really detailed.
4;8;The Vat of Acid Episode;Intergalactic Dealer #1;Yeah, well, I got a million of 'em. All right. I think I'm ready to deal with the world now. Let's get out of here.
4;8;The Vat of Acid Episode;Intergalactic Dealer #3;Should we drop our buddy in here before we go?
4;8;The Vat of Acid Episode;Intergalactic Dealer #1;Yeah, probably a good idea.
4;8;The Vat of Acid Episode;Intergalactic Dealer #3;Should we use a different vat? Does acid lose its acid power the more it dissolves?
4;8;The Vat of Acid Episode;Intergalactic Dealer #2;What am I, an acidologist? Here, grab that ratlike creature, we'll do a little test.
4;8;The Vat of Acid Episode;Intergalactic Dealer #1;Look, if you're going to test the damn acid, don't use a rat, take that ladle, grab a spoonful, and put it in the analyzer.
4;8;The Vat of Acid Episode;Intergalactic Dealer #2;Oh!
4;8;The Vat of Acid Episode;Intergalactic Dealer #1;Hey! Oh! Okay, I'd say that's pretty acidy. Drop him in. What are you doing?
4;8;The Vat of Acid Episode;Intergalactic Dealer #2;You said...
4;8;The Vat of Acid Episode;Intergalactic Dealer #1;Not the rat! The guy!
4;8;The Vat of Acid Episode;Intergalactic Dealer #3;Ooh! Marone! Look at the size of the bones on that rat!
4;8;The Vat of Acid Episode;Intergalactic Dealer #2;Oh! How many sets of bones this rat got? And look how the smaller ones are shaped! They're like little cartoon bones, like if you drew a bone in art class!
4;8;The Vat of Acid Episode;Intergalactic Dealer #1;All right, that tears it. I'm canceling the rest of my night and calling a bone scientist. We're getting to the bottom of this...
4;8;The Vat of Acid Episode;Morty;Jesus Christ, enough already!
4;8;The Vat of Acid Episode;Intergalactic Dealers;Oh! Hey! Whoa!
4;8;The Vat of Acid Episode;Morty;Can we go?
4;8;The Vat of Acid Episode;Rick;The fuck is wrong with you?
4;8;The Vat of Acid Episode;Morty;Just admit it was a shitty idea!
4;8;The Vat of Acid Episode;Rick;Having a grandson?
4;8;The Vat of Acid Episode;Morty;A vat of fake acid! Are you dying of dementia?
4;8;The Vat of Acid Episode;Rick;How are you talking to me like this? Wh-When did you get so cocky?
4;8;The Vat of Acid Episode;Morty;Tonight! Tonight, Rick! The night I saw you fail!
4;8;The Vat of Acid Episode;Rick;Because you ruined it!
4;8;The Vat of Acid Episode;Morty;It was pre-ruined!
4;8;The Vat of Acid Episode;Rick;Oh, was it worse than when I was a pickle? Oh-oh-oh that's right, you weren't there for that. Turned out kind of cool. Maybe there's a connection there.
4;8;The Vat of Acid Episode;Morty;Excuse me?
4;8;The Vat of Acid Episode;Rick;What's that cool thing you did without me again? The awesome thing? I-I-I guess you wanted a dragon? Mwah. Unforgettable.
4;8;The Vat of Acid Episode;Morty;God, fuck you.
4;8;The Vat of Acid Episode;Rick;"Timely, too, you really got in on that Game of Thrones"" fever right at the peak."""
4;8;The Vat of Acid Episode;Morty;You trying as hard as you can to hurt me right now proves my point.
4;8;The Vat of Acid Episode;Rick;I'll let you know when you have a point and the world will know when I try to hurt you.
4;8;The Vat of Acid Episode;Morty;Big man, big genius. Big lonely drunk.
4;8;The Vat of Acid Episode;Rick;Hey, save some of these atomic-age beatnik zingers for your English homework, Bukowski.
4;8;The Vat of Acid Episode;Rick;There's no such thing as a bad idea, Morty. It's about execution.
4;8;The Vat of Acid Episode;Morty;No such thing as a bad idea? Except all of mine, right?
4;8;The Vat of Acid Episode;Rick;Morty, wanting a dragon isn't an idea.
4;8;The Vat of Acid Episode;Morty;I'm not talking about that! I'm constantly pitching you ideas, Rick, and you act like they're not even worth thinking about!
4;8;The Vat of Acid Episode;Rick;What, the helicopter lawn chair? That's just something you saw on TV.
4;8;The Vat of Acid Episode;Morty;What about my video-game-style place-saving device?
4;8;The Vat of Acid Episode;Rick;Oh, my God, here we go.
4;8;The Vat of Acid Episode;Morty;It's a good idea, Rick! A device that lets you...
4;8;The Vat of Acid Episode;Rick;"Save your place like in a video game, but in real life so that you can try stuff and then go back to your save point. Yes, Morty, I saw it on Futurama."""""
4;8;The Vat of Acid Episode;Morty;Oh, so you don't do anything unless it's original?
4;8;The Vat of Acid Episode;Rick;I don't do time travel.
4;8;The Vat of Acid Episode;Morty;It's not time travel, it's saving a place in time...
4;8;The Vat of Acid Episode;Rick;Oh, my God, is this what you think I do? This is where the heavy lifting happens in your mind? Do you have any idea how much fucking work would have to go into a machine that...
4;8;The Vat of Acid Episode;Morty;Ah-ha! You can't do it!
4;8;The Vat of Acid Episode;Rick;I can do anything, Morty. Your idea is not worth doing.
4;8;The Vat of Acid Episode;Morty;You can't do it.
4;8;The Vat of Acid Episode;Rick;"Before what you're trying to do was called negging"", it was called ""reverse psychology"", and incels didn't invent it, Bugs Bunny did."""
4;8;The Vat of Acid Episode;Morty;You can't do it.
4;8;The Vat of Acid Episode;Rick;There is nothing I cannot do.
4;8;The Vat of Acid Episode;Morty;A place-saving video-game thing!
4;8;The Vat of Acid Episode;Rick;You're a piece of shit.
4;8;The Vat of Acid Episode;Morty;Just say you can't do it!
4;8;The Vat of Acid Episode;Rick;I won't!
4;8;The Vat of Acid Episode;Morty;You won't say you can't?
4;8;The Vat of Acid Episode;Rick;Fuck you, Morty!
4;8;The Vat of Acid Episode;Morty;Fuck you!
4;8;The Vat of Acid Episode;Rick;Fuck you! Son of a bitch.
4;8;The Vat of Acid Episode;Morty;So are you gonna...
4;8;The Vat of Acid Episode;Rick;Yes, I'm gonna fucking do it!
4;8;The Vat of Acid Episode;Morty;Rick, it's 3:00 a.m.. Wh-Wh-What's going on? W-Why'd you call me?
4;8;The Vat of Acid Episode;Rick;You were right, Morty. I failed. I can't make it. And honestly, I'm pretty ashamed. That might be why I've been so aggressive and unfair about rejecting your ideas.
4;8;The Vat of Acid Episode;Morty;Rick...
4;8;The Vat of Acid Episode;Rick;A fake acid vat, Morty? Maybe I've lost it. Maybe I never had it.
4;8;The Vat of Acid Episode;Morty;Hey. C'mon. Y-You know I didn't mean it that way. I just think we need to find better ways to communicate.
4;8;The Vat of Acid Episode;Rick;I'm sorry. I just... I lash out sometimes. I-I-I don't know why I do that! I'm so ashamed of myself. Hearing you talk about the vat... It really opened my eyes. Like what the fuck am I even doing?
4;8;The Vat of Acid Episode;Morty;Hey. Hey. I don't like hearing this talk. You're a great inventor. We just got a couple things to work on. Let's start with inventing a little honesty. Sound good?
4;8;The Vat of Acid Episode;Rick;Thank you, Morty. Sounds good. Or maybe I'll just kill you.
4;8;The Vat of Acid Episode;Morty;What? Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, Rick...
4;8;The Vat of Acid Episode;Rick;Because I fucking did it!
4;8;The Vat of Acid Episode;Morty;Oh-ho-ho!
4;8;The Vat of Acid Episode;Rick;Booya!
4;8;The Vat of Acid Episode;Morty;Holy shit. You did it! You did it!
4;8;The Vat of Acid Episode;Rick;I did it, you little son of a bitch!
4;8;The Vat of Acid Episode;Morty;How did you...
4;8;The Vat of Acid Episode;Rick;Morty, do you want me to explain, or you wanna go have some fun?
4;8;The Vat of Acid Episode;Morty;I wanna have some fun! Oh, my God. Rick, this is... This is... thank you!
4;8;The Vat of Acid Episode;Rick;You can thank me later. Go nuts.
4;8;The Vat of Acid Episode;Morty;Best grandpa ever!
4;8;The Vat of Acid Episode;Rick;That's all I ever wanted to hear.
4;8;The Vat of Acid Episode;Mr. Goldenfold;All right, class, I know I've been absent for most of this school year. I'll be honest with you... During spring break, I attended a renaissance faire and fell in love with a buxom hand-axe juggler half my age. I overplayed my interest in her lifestyle just to get closer to her, traveling the country with her troupe, and I am embarrassed to say I am now an expert blacksmith with several STDs and a broken heart. I beseech your nasty little asses to speak on the matter no further. Now that that's out of the way, who wants to do some math?
4;8;The Vat of Acid Episode;Morty;I'll do it.
4;8;The Vat of Acid Episode;Mr. Goldenfold;A bold move, Morty Smith. But can you deliver?
4;8;The Vat of Acid Episode;Morty;Oh, I've got something to deliver.
4;8;The Vat of Acid Episode;Mr. Goldenfold;Ahh! Oh, God. What the hell! Aw, goddamnit, this is traumatizing.
4;8;The Vat of Acid Episode;Student #1;Oh, my God, what's wrong with your dick?
4;8;The Vat of Acid Episode;Student #2;Not cool.
4;8;The Vat of Acid Episode;Mr. Goldenfold;I'm allergic to sheepskin!
4;8;The Vat of Acid Episode;Mr. Goldenfold;A bold move, Morty Smith. But can you deliver?
4;8;The Vat of Acid Episode;Morty;Holy shit. I can do anything.
4;8;The Vat of Acid Episode;Mr. Goldenfold;Yes, with math, anything is possible. Except a long-term relationship with a woman that calls you a warlock for using a phone.
4;8;The Vat of Acid Episode;Morty;Hi, uh, hey, Jessica.
4;8;The Vat of Acid Episode;Jessica;Oh. Hey, Morty.
4;8;The Vat of Acid Episode;Morty;Hey... Jessica, right?
4;8;The Vat of Acid Episode;Jessica;Um. Yeah. Hi. Sorry. I thought you knew my name because we've interacted so many times, but maybe I was just being stupid. Sorry. Hi. I-I'm Jessica. That's me. 
4;8;The Vat of Acid Episode;Morty;Cool. See you around.
4;8;The Vat of Acid Episode;Jessica;Jessica. Yeah. I hope I see you. Around.
4;8;The Vat of Acid Episode;Morty;Guess we'll see.
4;8;The Vat of Acid Episode;Morty;I think I'm gonna like this thing.
4;8;The Vat of Acid Episode;Morty;Ohhhh!
4;8;The Vat of Acid Episode;Police Cop;Oh shit suicide by cop! I love these!
4;8;The Vat of Acid Episode;Heroin Keith;You're living too fast, Morty.
4;8;The Vat of Acid Episode;Morty;I don't pay for your friendship, Heroin Keith.
4;8;The Vat of Acid Episode;Heroin Keith;Damn.
4;8;The Vat of Acid Episode;Morty;Oh, hi, Jessica. Hey, I'm sorry I brushed you off the other day. I was just trying to be cool... 
4;8;The Vat of Acid Episode;Jessica;Oh, I don't even know what you're talking about. But... you seem different. Like you finally found yourself.
4;8;The Vat of Acid Episode;Morty;Yeah. I... I guess I have.
4;8;The Vat of Acid Episode;Jessica;That's good to hear. I like who you found.
4;8;The Vat of Acid Episode;Morty;Yeah. Yeah, I do, too.
4;8;The Vat of Acid Episode;Jessica;Looking forward to seeing more. I'll see you tomorrow, Morty.
4;8;The Vat of Acid Episode;Morty;Yeah. Yeah, I'll see you tomorrow.
4;8;The Vat of Acid Episode;Rick;How's it going?
4;8;The Vat of Acid Episode;Morty;Y'know, it was fun, Rick. Real fun. Y'know I-I-I definitely sowed those oats. But I think you invented a little lesson for me along the way. Living without consequences is great, but then I started wondering... What am I living for? What am I building? If I'm always looking back, I'm never looking ahead. And then it hit me. We are who we are because of consequences. You can't live without consequences, y'know? You feel me?
4;8;The Vat of Acid Episode;Rick;Wow. That's a beautiful thought, Morty, but, uh, no. There were definitely consequences.
4;8;The Vat of Acid Episode;Morty;What're-What-What are you talking about?
4;8;The Vat of Acid Episode;Rick;I mean. You did everything you did. It all happened.
4;8;The Vat of Acid Episode;Morty;No. But the... the respawn button. The... The do-over.
4;8;The Vat of Acid Episode;Rick;It's not a do-over. You just did it. Over and over. 
4;8;The Vat of Acid Episode;Morty;What are you saying? W-What did you do?
4;8;The Vat of Acid Episode;Rick;"I think it's more appropriate to ask what did you do? You see, Morty, you weren't saving your place and going back. I don't respect time travel. If Ant Man and the Wasp"" can do it, I'm not interested. It wasn't so much a do-over as it was isolating a moment in time, splitting your probable selves, and shunting you into to into a near-duplicate, equally probable reality, transporting you into it at the moment of parallel determination."""
4;8;The Vat of Acid Episode;Rick;Pretty nifty. Time crystals are a bitch and a half, but the only real hitch is that there was already a you in each probable dimension. So we had to solve for that.
4;8;The Vat of Acid Episode;Rick;"That's right, you little bitch! It's The Prestige""! You ""Prestige'd"" yourself!"""
4;8;The Vat of Acid Episode;Morty;Rick, how many did I kill?
4;8;The Vat of Acid Episode;Rick;You tell me, Morty. Every time you reset to smell Jessica's hair, every time you relived a satisfying fart, that's how many Mortys you've incinerated, you greedy little junkie.
4;8;The Vat of Acid Episode;Morty;Oh, God... Even those times when I...
4;8;The Vat of Acid Episode;Rick;Especially those times. It's over, Morty. Feel this. Take this in. This is God. 
4;8;The Vat of Acid Episode;Morty;Wh-Wh-Wh-Wh... Why would you do this?
4;8;The Vat of Acid Episode;Rick;My hands are clean, Morty. I gave you a choice. You could listen to me explain, in great scientific detail, how it all works... Or you could have fun. Did you have fun, Morty?
4;8;The Vat of Acid Episode;Morty;Is this because of the vat?
4;8;The Vat of Acid Episode;Rick;No.
4;8;The Vat of Acid Episode;Morty;I'm sorry.
4;8;The Vat of Acid Episode;Rick;I'm afraid it's too late for that, Morty. What's done is done, but it can end. The original split is still timestamped. I can make it so those Mortys never existed at all, make them purely theoretical.
4;8;The Vat of Acid Episode;Morty;Oh, God. What do I do?
4;8;The Vat of Acid Episode;Rick;I think it's clear you've done enough.
4;8;The Vat of Acid Episode;Morty;Tell me how, Rick! Tell me how I save those Mortys!
4;8;The Vat of Acid Episode;Rick;You live with the consequences. Those things happened somewhere, but you can merge the probable realities so that only one Morty did them.
4;8;The Vat of Acid Episode;Morty;Just do it. 
4;8;The Vat of Acid Episode;Rick;All right, lemme just sync these up and get you back to your dimension.
4;8;The Vat of Acid Episode;Morty;Wait, so... So you're not even my Rick? Then... Then why do you know about the vat?
4;8;The Vat of Acid Episode;Rick;Every Rick has a vat!
4;8;The Vat of Acid Episode;Rick;Well, Morty, I'd say we've invented a little honesty today. How about you?
4;8;The Vat of Acid Episode;Morty;I don't deserve this. I was just having fun.
4;8;The Vat of Acid Episode;Rick;So was Jeffrey Dahmer. Speaking of, time to pay the piper.
4;8;The Vat of Acid Episode;SWAT Officer;Morty Smith. Come out with your hands up, you sick fuck. We're also fine with just shooting you if you wanna suicide by cop.
4;8;The Vat of Acid Episode;Morty;What? What is this?
4;8;The Vat of Acid Episode;Rick;Wow. Looks like a SWAT Team, some drug dealers, some grassroots MeToo activists, the ACLU... Jesus, Morty, the AARP?
4;8;The Vat of Acid Episode;Morty;I don't wanna talk about it!
4;8;The Vat of Acid Episode;Rick;The NAACP, GamerGate... Morty, is that Supreme Court Justice Sonia Sotomayor?
4;8;The Vat of Acid Episode;Morty;I'm sorry! I... I'm sorry! I-Is that what you want me to say? What... What do I do?
4;8;The Vat of Acid Episode;Rick;Oof, well, I'm stumped. Seems like there's no way out of this one. Unless...
4;8;The Vat of Acid Episode;Morty;God damn it.
4;8;The Vat of Acid Episode;Rick;"Yeah, I guess it is, uh... What did you call it? Uh, uh, A shitty idea""?"""
4;8;The Vat of Acid Episode;Morty;God damn it.
4;8;The Vat of Acid Episode;Rick;Say the vat is good.
4;8;The Vat of Acid Episode;Morty;The vat is good.
4;8;The Vat of Acid Episode;Rick;Kiss the vat.
4;8;The Vat of Acid Episode;SWAT Officer;Do not go into that vat. It appears to be full of acid.
4;8;The Vat of Acid Episode;Rick;It is! Please, he's just a little boy! Let me talk to him.
4;8;The Vat of Acid Episode;SWAT Officer;Tell him we're very upset!
4;8;The Vat of Acid Episode;Rick;Morty, please. Step back. That vat is full of acid. It'll melt you completely, leaving only your bones.
4;8;The Vat of Acid Episode;Morty;Goddamn it!
4;8;The Vat of Acid Episode;Rick;I'm sorry, what did you say?
4;8;The Vat of Acid Episode;Morty;I'm going in the vat!
4;8;The Vat of Acid Episode;Rick;Oh! God! Aw, I blame myself! Oh, what a tragedy. This... Oh, well, he's bones now. I guess all debts are paid.
4;8;The Vat of Acid Episode;Lawyer;Agreed. He's definitely dead.
4;8;The Vat of Acid Episode;Activist #1;Why else would the bones come up?
4;8;The Vat of Acid Episode;Activist #2;While his actions were horrifying and we are well within our rights to be outraged, I do wonder if we bear some responsibility for this young man melting himself in acid. Are we here for justice... Or something else?
4;8;The Vat of Acid Episode;Judge;"Though justice be thy plea, consider this, that in the course of justice... None of us should see salvation. We do pray for mercy""."""
4;8;The Vat of Acid Episode;Rick;"Merchant of Venice"", nice. Very cool. Lots to think about."""
4;8;The Vat of Acid Episode;Heroin Keith;Vengeance is a tomb, all-encompassing...
4;8;The Vat of Acid Episode;Rick;All right, okay, this isn't a poetry reading, a kid just died. Everybody go home and hug your loved one or something.
4;8;The Vat of Acid Episode;SWAT Officer #1;Wait. How do we know that's really acid and you didn't just have someone's bones in there?
4;8;The Vat of Acid Episode;Rick;I mean, if you're doubting if that's really acid and not just jacuzzi-heated Mountain Dew, you're welcome to use this ladle.
4;8;The Vat of Acid Episode;SWAT Officer #1;You think I'm a goddamn idiot? Brought my own.
4;8;The Vat of Acid Episode;SWAT Officer #2;Aah! Oh, God! Oh, God no! Oh, God, no! Oh, no... Huh? I'm acid-proof! Fuck all of you, fuck all of you, I'm gonna be rich! Here's my ass. Take a good look, spank it! Acid proof!
4;8;The Vat of Acid Episode;Rick;Feels like that guy had other stuff going on. Don't ever make fun of me again. Ever! All right, c'mon Morty, let's go home.
4;8;The Vat of Acid Episode;Morty;Wait, what? This... This isn't our reality?
4;8;The Vat of Acid Episode;Rick;What, you think I'd waste our home teaching you a fucking lesson? I am gonna miss this place, though... Johnny Carson's still alive and on the air, 9/11 never happened, and Rocky Road ice cream has peanut butter instead of marshmallows.
4;8;The Vat of Acid Episode;Morty;The fu... What? The marshmallows are the best part!
4;8;The Vat of Acid Episode;Rick;Morty...
4;8;The Vat of Acid Episode;Johnny Carson;Our next guest, ah, gave us, well, actually, very little information, ah, besides the fact that he is, uh, impervious to acid. So here he is, he's here to prove it. Let's welcome this guy.
4;8;The Vat of Acid Episode;SWAT Officer;Let's do this shit!
4;8;The Vat of Acid Episode;Johnny Carson;Now, you're, uh... You're sure about this?
4;8;The Vat of Acid Episode;SWAT Officer;Eat my. Hoist me!
4;8;The Vat of Acid Episode;Johnny Carson;I did not know that ass was on the menu.
4;8;The Vat of Acid Episode;SWAT Officer;Don't steal my moment! Do it!
4;8;The Vat of Acid Episode;Johnny Carson;Ah, okay, then without further ado... drop him.
4;8;The Vat of Acid Episode;SWAT Officer;Oh, yeah! Oh, yeah! Oh, yeah! Oh, yeah, oh, yeah!
4;8;The Vat of Acid Episode;Johnny Carson;Looks like I'll be eating flamb. Please kill me.
4;9;Childrick of Mort;Summer;"What kind of parents drag their kids away for the entire week of spring break? I'm missing Mike Triscuit's drug party. Look at this. He's already watching Euphoria"" to pregame."""
4;9;Childrick of Mort;Morty;Pregame. Game. Video game.
4;9;Childrick of Mort;Jerry;Yes, yes, drugs and video games. Poor babies. What you need is to level up with a bong rip of nature. Trust me, this is good for you.
4;9;Childrick of Mort;Summer;Can someone just kill me? Grandpa Rick, you can kill anything.
4;9;Childrick of Mort;Jerry;No, he can't, Summer. We're roughing it. And that means no sci-fi bullshit. Isn't that right, Rick?
4;9;Childrick of Mort;Rick;Uh-huh.
4;9;Childrick of Mort;Jerry;Rick, was that a sci-fi phone call?
4;9;Childrick of Mort;Rick;Shut up, Jerry. Damn it, I didn't think she had this number.
4;9;Childrick of Mort;Morty;Why are you building a Faraday box to block out the signal?
4;9;Childrick of Mort;Summer;Oh, my God, Grandpa's ghosting someone.
4;9;Childrick of Mort;Rick;I'm not ghosting. Hey! Give it back, Summer!
4;9;Childrick of Mort;Summer;"Rick. Please answer me. I'm pregnant""?! Oh, my God, Grandpa, you fuck boi."""
4;9;Childrick of Mort;Rick;I'm not a fuck boi Summer! There's no way those kids are mine.
4;9;Childrick of Mort;Jerry;Wow. At least we know why Rick actually came on the trip... To avoid his fuck-guy problems.
4;9;Childrick of Mort;Beth;Why would this person lie?
4;9;Childrick of Mort;Rick;I don't know, honey. She's addicted to what the Rick did. You know, it's... it's... It's a tale as old as my huge dynamite penis. Can we turn the radio on?
4;9;Childrick of Mort;Beth;I am not letting you abandon those kids like you abandoned me.
4;9;Childrick of Mort;Rick;Oh, my God!
4;9;Childrick of Mort;Beth;We're going to see this baby mama right now!
4;9;Childrick of Mort;Rick;What, like, literally now?
4;9;Childrick of Mort;Beth;Yes, now! That's an order.
4;9;Childrick of Mort;Jerry;Aah! No! This is exactly what I was talking about! Rick, I hope you realize the tubing permit was non-refundable!
4;9;Childrick of Mort;Rick;Relax, Jerry, we'll be in and out in a minute, and then you can get right back to your dumb vacation with a family that doesn't need you.
4;9;Childrick of Mort;Jerry;Kind of expected someone to defend me, but, sure, okay.
4;9;Childrick of Mort;Rick;Hello, Gaia. Hold on. Let me just adjust my Seismic-to-English translator.
4;9;Childrick of Mort;Gaia;Rick. You came.
4;9;Childrick of Mort;Morty;W-Where is she?
4;9;Childrick of Mort;Rick;You're looking at her.
4;9;Childrick of Mort;Morty;I-I-I-I don't understand.
4;9;Childrick of Mort;Rick;Isn't it obvious, Morty? I fuck a planet.
4;9;Childrick of Mort;Morty;So, what, you just go around knocking up planets now? I-I-Is that what you do when I'm at school?
4;9;Childrick of Mort;Rick;I'm a scientist, Morty. I try things. Sex with a living planet? Big step for mankind.
4;9;Childrick of Mort;Summer;Yeah, we finally broke the deadbeat dad barrier.
4;9;Childrick of Mort;Rick;Ah, where the magic happened.
4;9;Childrick of Mort;Beth;Gross.
4;9;Childrick of Mort;Rick;Hey, uh, Gaia, baby, Big Daddy Rick is here. What's the problem?
4;9;Childrick of Mort;Gaia;Children. Birth cycle. Now.
4;9;Childrick of Mort;Rick;Okay, gettin' right into it.
4;9;Childrick of Mort;Ricklets;I am! I am!
4;9;Childrick of Mort;Beth;Jesus Christ!
4;9;Childrick of Mort;Ricklets;I am! I am! I am!
4;9;Childrick of Mort;Beth;Dad, do something! Make it stop!
4;9;Childrick of Mort;Rick;You think I know how to stop this? I thought she was gonna shit an egg.
4;9;Childrick of Mort;Summer;Cool vacation, guys. So happy I got to see the human geyser instead of micro-dosing with my friends.
4;9;Childrick of Mort;Gaia;More coming. Kids. Need father.
4;9;Childrick of Mort;Rick;Yeah, um, Baby Quakes, how big is your orbit again? I mean, not to say you get around, but, um...
4;9;Childrick of Mort;Beth;Are you kidding me? Look at them! They look just like you.
4;9;Childrick of Mort;Rick;Yeah, and snakes look like dildos, Beth. What's your point?
4;9;Childrick of Mort;Jerry;They do?
4;9;Childrick of Mort;Rick;The fact is even if they were mine, which they're not, the best parent is evolution. They'll probably develop harder skin or maybe even webbed arms. Man, that'd be cool, huh? Flying squirrel people?
4;9;Childrick of Mort;Beth;Yeah, Dad, that approach worked out great for me.
4;9;Childrick of Mort;Rick;Beth, I know it looks bad, but trust me. This is life in the galaxy, okay? It's totally normal.
4;9;Childrick of Mort;Beth;Fine. You won't do something, I will.
4;9;Childrick of Mort;Jerry;Welp, there goes the surprise! I was gonna have us jump on the trampoline after we caught our first fish.
4;9;Childrick of Mort;Ricklets;I am!
4;9;Childrick of Mort;Beth;What? You're stupid.
4;9;Childrick of Mort;Ricklets;I am!
4;9;Childrick of Mort;Ricklets;I am! I am!
4;9;Childrick of Mort;Rick;Beth, that's not gonna help.
4;9;Childrick of Mort;Jerry;Uh, I hate to agree with Rick, but shouldn't we just let this be? We're supposed to be on vacation.
4;9;Childrick of Mort;Beth;You're unemployed, Jerry! Every day is a vacation for you.
4;9;Childrick of Mort;Jerry;Okay, ouch.
4;9;Childrick of Mort;Beth;You guys do whatever you want. I'm staying here and fixing this.
4;9;Childrick of Mort;Ricklets;I am! - I am!
4;9;Childrick of Mort;Ricklets;I am!
4;9;Childrick of Mort;Rick;Goddamn it, Beth, if you're gonna do it, at least do it right.
4;9;Childrick of Mort;Rick;Gaia, baby, gonna need a little raw iron and steam.
4;9;Childrick of Mort;Gaia;Whatever you need, baby.
4;9;Childrick of Mort;Summer;So much for camping.
4;9;Childrick of Mort;Jerry;Nope. We are going camping. There's trees over there. We're on solid ground.
4;9;Childrick of Mort;Summer;Mom!
4;9;Childrick of Mort;Morty;Mom!
4;9;Childrick of Mort;Beth;Summer, Morty, go camp with your father.
4;9;Childrick of Mort;Morty;Ohh, son of a bitch.
4;9;Childrick of Mort;Summer;Son of a bitch.
4;9;Childrick of Mort;Ricklets;I am! 
4;9;Childrick of Mort;Ricklets;I am!
4;9;Childrick of Mort;Ricklets;I am! 
4;9;Childrick of Mort;Ricklets;I am!
4;9;Childrick of Mort;Rick;Welp, welcome to lack of abandonment.
4;9;Childrick of Mort;Morty;Dad, can we please go back and hang out with Grandpa's clay people?
4;9;Childrick of Mort;Jerry;Why? Because they might have a Sega Dreamcast? Why is it so hard for you two to let nature in?
4;9;Childrick of Mort;Summer;Because this sucks ass. Camping is just being homeless without the change.
4;9;Childrick of Mort;Jerry;Well, that attitude is exactly why we're out here. You guys wouldn't last two seconds on your own. You're only happy when you're penned in and drugged up like some kind of chicken or lemur. Hey! I told you kids no phones!
4;9;Childrick of Mort;Morty;There's not even any service. Just... Just let us be happy for a minute.
4;9;Childrick of Mort;Jerry;You know, maybe if you two stopped whining and let your old man take the reins, you might actually learn something. Here. Take a bite of this tasty treat.
4;9;Childrick of Mort;Summer;"Oh, you think this s'more makes you special? What? Because someone said good job""to you once, when you were 10? That's actually really sad, dad. Let's be real. You've been high-roading us non-stop, forcing us to do nothing in the middle of fucking nowhere because it's the only way you're gonna level the playing field, isn't it? Because if you move the bar so low, you might actually seem like you're worth a fuck."""
4;9;Childrick of Mort;Jerry;Huh. I'm gonna go take a walk.
4;9;Childrick of Mort;Morty;Jesus Christ. You really need to stop hanging out with Rick.
4;9;Childrick of Mort;Rick;Okay, so, if we divert the Lawyer Pipeline here, they should avoid the Ethics Tube and come out spineless enough to do their job.
4;9;Childrick of Mort;Beth;Right. Wait, why are the athletes going through the introvert sector?
4;9;Childrick of Mort;Rick;Obviously so they can bully the mathematicians and give us astronomers.
4;9;Childrick of Mort;Beth;God, you are such a space nerd.
4;9;Childrick of Mort;Rick;I'm not a nerd. We're raising a society here, Beth. If we want them to be self-sufficient, they need to get out into space.
4;9;Childrick of Mort;Gaia;Birth cycle. Coming.
4;9;Childrick of Mort;Rick;We got you, Gai-Gai! Shoot 'em hard and up the middle!
4;9;Childrick of Mort;Rick;We got an oversupply of teachers putting a strain on the literary drive.
4;9;Childrick of Mort;Beth;Activating playwright converter!
4;9;Childrick of Mort;Ricklet;Aah!
4;9;Childrick of Mort;Rick;Nice work, honey. Okay, the therapists are getting bored. We need to increase their supply of incest porn.
4;9;Childrick of Mort;Beth;20% wasn't enough? What the hell is that?
4;9;Childrick of Mort;Rick;The unproductives. Goddamn it! How are there so many of them?
4;9;Childrick of Mort;Beth;Unproductives?
4;9;Childrick of Mort;Rick;Yeah, deejays, foodies, influencers. I just re-circulate them through until... Shit, they blew a hole in the human resources department!
4;9;Childrick of Mort;Ricklets;You're fired! Downsizing already? I'm putting this in your file!
4;9;Childrick of Mort;Beth;We gotta fix this, Dad. We can't keep recycling them through.
4;9;Childrick of Mort;Rick;I could add an online college workaround.
4;9;Childrick of Mort;Beth;Or just push them out through a pipe in the back.
4;9;Childrick of Mort;Rick;Same thing.
4;9;Childrick of Mort;Beth;Same thing.
4;9;Childrick of Mort;Rick;These kids may not be mine, but you definitely are. Look at you. My little steampunk overlord.
4;9;Childrick of Mort;Beth;Eeee!
4;9;Childrick of Mort;Morty;I don't think he's coming back. You know, you... you really messed him up, Summer.
4;9;Childrick of Mort;Summer;Yeah, well, he called me a lemur. Let's just go find grandpa. Maybe he can portal us home or something.
4;9;Childrick of Mort;Morty;Should we leave a note?
4;9;Childrick of Mort;Summer;Dad is fine. He's probably sucking off a tree and having the time of his life right now.
4;9;Childrick of Mort;Jerry;Guess you don't want to learn how to skip rocks, either. Aah! Aaah!
4;9;Childrick of Mort;Jerry;Who are you guys?
4;9;Childrick of Mort;Ricklet;We are... unproductives.
4;9;Childrick of Mort;Jerry;Ahh, I get it. Bunch of bullshit.
4;9;Childrick of Mort;Ricklet;What is that?
4;9;Childrick of Mort;Jerry;This? This is camping.
4;9;Childrick of Mort;Ricklet;Camping? Ooh! Camping!
4;9;Childrick of Mort;Ricklets;Camping! Camping!
4;9;Childrick of Mort;Jerry;Good work there, TickTock. Keep whittling. Incredible. You've almost got smoke over there, Florflock. There you go, guys! Pump those cheeks. That's the camping spirit.
4;9;Childrick of Mort;Jerry;What the... Squeeb! This is not a tent. 
4;9;Childrick of Mort;Squeeb;It is a new kind of tent, with special gutters to funnel the rain, and a door.
4;9;Childrick of Mort;Jerry;It's a house! No houses! No doors! Once you have doors, you have indoors. Once you have indoors, you won't want to camp anymore.
4;9;Childrick of Mort;Squeeb;Then why do they not camp?
4;9;Childrick of Mort;Jerry;Because they're bad.
4;9;Childrick of Mort;Squeeb;Bad. Bad. Bad.
4;9;Childrick of Mort;Ricklets;Bad! Bad! Bad!
4;9;Childrick of Mort;Summer;Oh, my God. Maybe Dad was right. Maybe we have no life skills.
4;9;Childrick of Mort;Morty;I've definitely drank more pee than I care to remember.
4;9;Childrick of Mort;Summer;I'm just gonna sit down. If I die, don't eat my ass. That'd be weird.
4;9;Childrick of Mort;Morty;Uh, Summer?
4;9;Childrick of Mort;Summer;Damn, you think they got infected by a mind slug or something?
4;9;Childrick of Mort;Morty;Probably drove through a nebula that made them see their own fears.
4;9;Childrick of Mort;Morty;Whoa! These controls. It's just like my video game controllers. I just wish I could read these symbols.
4;9;Childrick of Mort;Summer;This looks just like Tricia's bong. Morty, I think these tubes might contain all of their collective knowledge. Mm!
4;9;Childrick of Mort;Morty;Well?
4;9;Childrick of Mort;Summer;I think we got this, bro.
4;9;Childrick of Mort;Rick;Beth, you wanna do the honors?
4;9;Childrick of Mort;Beth;What? Really? Wow. Okay. Here we go.
4;9;Childrick of Mort;Rick;If you told me six days ago I'd be christening a generation ship for my half-rock children, I would've called you crazy. But I guess that's the lesson... Crazy things happen when you put in the work. Salud! Fucking Doopnar! Sing something!
4;9;Childrick of Mort;Beth;Great toast, Dad.
4;9;Childrick of Mort;Rick;Thanks, sweetie.
4;9;Childrick of Mort;Beth;Damn, listen to those pipes. You sure these kids are yours?
4;9;Childrick of Mort;Rick;"What, you've never heard me sing karaoke? I'm... I'm pretty good when someone's in my register, like the guy that sings Circle of Life"". Can't remember his name. Dresses up weird."""
4;9;Childrick of Mort;Beth;Look at this. Everyone's happy. They're about to go into space. I know things haven't always been great with us, but we do make a pretty good team.
4;9;Childrick of Mort;Gaia;Uh, Rick? Can we talk?
4;9;Childrick of Mort;Rick;Kinda in the middle of a breakthrough with my daughter.
4;9;Childrick of Mort;Beth;Go ahead, Dad. Gaia deserves some time, too. They're your kids.
4;9;Childrick of Mort;Gaia;Yes, about that.
4;9;Childrick of Mort;Reggie;Pam! It's good to see you, baby!
4;9;Childrick of Mort;Rick;Um, Gaia? You know this guy?
4;9;Childrick of Mort;Reggie;Ha! You call her Gaia? So lame.
4;9;Childrick of Mort;Beth;Is that... God?
4;9;Childrick of Mort;Gaia;Rick. The kids. I messed up. You're not their father.
4;9;Childrick of Mort;Reggie;Little ones! Daddy's here! I'm sending some fog down. Feel my presence through the fog!
4;9;Childrick of Mort;Ricklets;Ooh!
4;9;Childrick of Mort;Rick;Beth! What the fuck. Don't touch it!
4;9;Childrick of Mort;Beth;You gotta be kidding me. God is the father?
4;9;Childrick of Mort;Reggie;No hard feelings, okay? We thought they were yours, you know, because they're so small.
4;9;Childrick of Mort;Rick;Oh, wow. No hard feelings. Y-You hear that, Beth? Guy swoops in after we raised his whole civilization and tells us he forgives us. What a fucking mooch!
4;9;Childrick of Mort;Reggie;Don't push me, asshole!
4;9;Childrick of Mort;Gaia;Rick, I think you should go.
4;9;Childrick of Mort;Rick;Seriously? You really want this pile of dry ice to raise your kids?
4;9;Childrick of Mort;Reggie;Stop acting like you did a good job. You made my kids soft and empty inside. This city is a monument to nothing! Where is their faith?
4;9;Childrick of Mort;Gaia;Reggie is right. The children are not ready to leave. He can give them more.
4;9;Childrick of Mort;Beth;I mean, maybe we should just bail, Dad. At least this guy is immortal and can stick around.
4;9;Childrick of Mort;Rick;Bullshit! They're my kids! We're staying!
4;9;Childrick of Mort;Ricklets;Bad! Bad! Bad!
4;9;Childrick of Mort;Reggie;See? Now, this is the kind of shit I'm talking about.
4;9;Childrick of Mort;Beth;Jerry! Oh, my God! Is that you? What the hell are you doing?
4;9;Childrick of Mort;Jerry;Camping.
4;9;Childrick of Mort;Rick;Oh, look, Jerry finally found his people. All it took was a deep enough drip pan.
4;9;Childrick of Mort;Jerry;"You labeled these creatures unproductive"", but I have given them more purpose than ever."""
4;9;Childrick of Mort;Rick;Oh, yeah? They filing your unemployment forms?
4;9;Childrick of Mort;Jerry;His tongue is sharp, but it cannot whittle. The Great Roughing of It is at hand. You will now join the One Family on its Eternal Getaway. Or join the embers over which we hold marshmallows at just the right distance.
4;9;Childrick of Mort;Squeeb;Six inches! Until it gets golden brown! Don't let it start on fire! The carbon is bad for you!
4;9;Childrick of Mort;Jerry;What's happening?
4;9;Childrick of Mort;Reggie;My children, I give you my power. Use it to take what is yours.
4;9;Childrick of Mort;Rick;Oh, this mother-fucker. Raise the walls!
4;9;Childrick of Mort;Jerry;Walls can't stop us, Rick. We are chosen. Sha-boom-boom! Sorry! Sorry! Just trying to get the hang of this thing.
4;9;Childrick of Mort;Rick;"Nice choice of chosen people, G-diddles. I guess you'll be playing the mysterious ways"" card on that one."""
4;9;Childrick of Mort;Reggie;You wanna go, bro? I'll kick your ass myself.
4;9;Childrick of Mort;Rick;Oh, dude, don't tempt me. When I'm done with you, you'll need a staff to un-part your fucking face.
4;9;Childrick of Mort;Gaia;Guys. Please. Not in front of the kids.
4;9;Childrick of Mort;Rick;Did you for real just try to smite me? Siri, triangulate source of power. Got you now, you son of a bitch. Sweetie, you handle the hippies. I'll handle the off-brand Yahweh.
4;9;Childrick of Mort;Beth;Kick his ass, Dad!
4;9;Childrick of Mort;Rick;Bear witness.
4;9;Childrick of Mort;Reggie;Now you see my true form. The clouds were simply a shape more appealing to Gaia's mind.
4;9;Childrick of Mort;Rick;No shit. Any form is more appealing than this. You look like Kid Rock fuck Zeus. Oh, seriously, you expect me to fight you like this? You're the size of four Empire State Buildings.
4;9;Childrick of Mort;Reggie;Alright, motherfucker. Let's go.
4;9;Childrick of Mort;Reggie;Ha-ha! You like that?
4;9;Childrick of Mort;Rick;Ohh!
4;9;Childrick of Mort;Reggie;Here comes some pain!
4;9;Childrick of Mort;Summer;And... That last one should be... The start button.
4;9;Childrick of Mort;Morty;Perfect. I guess we're ready. Let's show Mom and Dad what video games and partying are all about.
4;9;Childrick of Mort;Summer;Jesus Christ, was that the wings?
4;9;Childrick of Mort;Morty;This is not like a video game!
4;9;Childrick of Mort;Summer;Oh, my God, make it stop! Make it stop!
4;9;Childrick of Mort;Morty;How do I make it stop?!
4;9;Childrick of Mort;Summer;I don't know. I'm fucking high! Aah!
4;9;Childrick of Mort;Morty;Oh, God, now I'm high, too!
4;9;Childrick of Mort;Beth;Jerry, that's enough.
4;9;Childrick of Mort;Jerry;Oh, hey, babe. You like these plagues I'm unleashing on your asses?
4;9;Childrick of Mort;Beth;No, they're lame. It's not a great sign that your army's on the same side as disease.
4;9;Childrick of Mort;Jerry;Sorry we aren't modern enough to sort people by value and shit the losers through a mean butt tube!
4;9;Childrick of Mort;Beth;Just admit this is about you wanting to feel needed!
4;9;Childrick of Mort;Jerry;Says the woman who sold out her family for an ounce of approval from her drunk father!
4;9;Childrick of Mort;Beth;Well, maybe he drinks because it isn't easy to be more powerful than God.
4;9;Childrick of Mort;Jerry;Well, if it's god power that gets you going, light some candles and put on the Billy Ocean because Moses is home and he's ready to burn some bush! Sha-boom-boom!
4;9;Childrick of Mort;Rick;Ohh! Fuck. Ow! Alright, alright, stop.
4;9;Childrick of Mort;Reggie;Come on, bitch!
4;9;Childrick of Mort;Rick;Look, you win, okay? Ju... I don't care about the kids. Smite them, raise them to fuck sheep. Just keep the city, okay? My daughter and I built that thing. It's important to her.
4;9;Childrick of Mort;Reggie;No, bro. I'm a Zeus. I can literally do anything. Think I'm gonna hang around and raise kids? The only lesson they need is right here... Fear. And it looks like school's out, bitch.
4;9;Childrick of Mort;Rick;I-I think you mean school's in.
4;9;Childrick of Mort;Reggie;What are... What are you talking about?
4;9;Childrick of Mort;Rick;I-If you're teaching fear, then choking me... School would be in.
4;9;Childrick of Mort;Reggie;Fine. School's in, bitch.
4;9;Childrick of Mort;Rick;Oh. What the fuck?
4;9;Childrick of Mort;Morty;Ohh! Are we dead? D-Did we die?
4;9;Childrick of Mort;Summer;I don't ever want to be high again. I-I got scared straight. Oh, my God, I got scared straight.
4;9;Childrick of Mort;Morty;Fuck. Dad was right. We... We think we know everything, but maybe we're the ones who suck.
4;9;Childrick of Mort;Rick;You kids are my fucking heroes! You saved Grandpa's life! I fucking love you so much!
4;9;Childrick of Mort;Summer;Papa!
4;9;Childrick of Mort;Morty;Papa! We played video games and got high! We did wrong! We did wrong!
4;9;Childrick of Mort;Rick;Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, little boopas. Come on, now. You kids, you did real good here. You did good. Getting high and playing video games is the best, I swear to fucking God.
4;9;Childrick of Mort;Morty;But mom and dad are gonna be mad.
4;9;Childrick of Mort;Rick;No, hey, hey, look, no. Fuck your mom and dad. Your parents are a bag of dicks. Getting high and playing video games is the best, and I will never sell you out, ever. Now, we got to get out of here before this guy falls out of the sky. He's generating an ionic cloud from his own belief system. 
4;9;Childrick of Mort;Rick;Holy shit Summer, were you smoking this? You were basically inhaling brake fluid. Jesus! Mm, yeah.
4;9;Childrick of Mort;Jerry;It's over, Beth. Tell your people to lower the gates and pack their moisturewicking shirts.
4;9;Childrick of Mort;Ricklet;Incoming!
4;9;Childrick of Mort;Beth;Jerry!
4;9;Childrick of Mort;Jerry;Beth! Just hold on!
4;9;Childrick of Mort;Beth;I'm losing my grip!
4;9;Childrick of Mort;Squeeb;Jerry.
4;9;Childrick of Mort;Jerry;Squeeb?
4;9;Childrick of Mort;Squeeb;Use the s'more, Jerry.
4;9;Childrick of Mort;Beth;Ow! You stabbed my hand!
4;9;Childrick of Mort;Jerry;Sorry! Sorry! Should... Should we make love?
4;9;Childrick of Mort;Beth;Jerry, I love you, but I can literally smell your balls from here.
4;9;Childrick of Mort;Jerry;Oh, wow.
4;9;Childrick of Mort;Beth;Ask God for a flood next time. It'll come with a shower.
4;9;Childrick of Mort;Jerry;Noted.
4;9;Childrick of Mort;Morty;Aw, geez, that... That poor guy.
4;9;Childrick of Mort;Summer;Can you maybe not tell Mom and Dad?
4;9;Childrick of Mort;Rick;Relax, it's just a Zeus. If this was the real God, it... It'd be a completely different story.
4;9;Childrick of Mort;Gaia;Rick! What did you do?!
4;9;Childrick of Mort;Rick;I mean, gravity did most of it. So, you, technically.
4;9;Childrick of Mort;Gaia;I told you to leave!
4;9;Childrick of Mort;Rick;"Yeah, well, you also asked me to raise your kids. Uh, not sure if you heard the phrase, pick a lane"", but..."""
4;9;Childrick of Mort;Gaia;You killed their father!
4;9;Childrick of Mort;Rick;Father or not, he was a lying piece of shit. I don't care who else stuffed your crust, but I'm the guy that showed up. But I mean, if you want, I can still power-wash his guts off the tower and maybe...
4;9;Childrick of Mort;Gaia;Get oooout!
4;9;Childrick of Mort;Rick;Okay, yeah, she's pissed.
4;9;Childrick of Mort;Summer;I mean, you killed her slam piece, Grandpa. I don't blame her.
4;9;Childrick of Mort;Jerry;See? you put the fire stick to the wood, and, voila! Campfire.
4;9;Childrick of Mort;Squeeb;You have known about this the whole time?
4;9;Childrick of Mort;Rick;I'm not gonna waste my time building you an ark, but if your mom gets clingy, you can use this to get some space.
4;9;Childrick of Mort;Jerry;Is that all you want to say to your children before you leave?
4;9;Childrick of Mort;Rick;Oh, yeah, uh, don't ask me for money.
4;9;Childrick of Mort;Beth;I mean, Gaia's not gonna raise those guys to hunt us down, right?
4;9;Childrick of Mort;Rick;Oh, most definitely. I put a tracker on their ship. I'll blow it up if they come anywhere near me.
4;9;Childrick of Mort;Jerry;Well, kids, never thought I'd say this, but, Summer, you were right.
4;9;Childrick of Mort;Summer;Wait, what?
4;9;Childrick of Mort;Jerry;I thought I wanted to teach you guys about tents, but really, I just wanted to feel important. I guess sometimes teenagers do know what they're talking about, even if it's mean.
4;9;Childrick of Mort;Morty;Right, but didn't you, like, go into god-mode and fight mom?
4;9;Childrick of Mort;Jerry;Love is the only power that matters, Morty.
4;9;Childrick of Mort;Rick;No, you had actual power, and you did jack shit. That was a divine staff. You could've cured cancer or raised the dead. Instead, you made bugs.
4;9;Childrick of Mort;Beth;Well, I was impressed, Dad. He saved my life, no thanks to you.
4;9;Childrick of Mort;Rick;Your kids got high on alien mist and drove the ship into that Zeus guy's head. Basically murdered him.
4;9;Childrick of Mort;Summer;Grandpa!
4;9;Childrick of Mort;Morty;What the hell?! Come on! 
4;9;Childrick of Mort;Rick;"What? You did. I mean, not to cast the first stone, but, Beth and Jerry, pretty terrible parenting on your part. Did you know Summer huffed a K-Zax Array? She basically smoked The Ring."" Most pilots die after three days. And Morty, the fucking moron, he thought the ship worked like a game controller. What in the Disney Channel fuck is that? Maybe help him with homework next time. He's clearly crying for help."""
4;9;Childrick of Mort;Voice;Planets Only. Planets Only. Planets Only.
4;9;Childrick of Mort;Voice;Entire systems of steamy, lush globes and barely habitable celestial objects are drifting through the void just for you. Planets Only.
4;9;Childrick of Mort;Planet #1;Let's terraform. Or colonize me as I am.
4;9;Childrick of Mort;Voice;Planets Only.
4;9;Childrick of Mort;Planet #2;Oops, there's a hole in my ozone. I didn't put it there. Did you? I can't fill it by myself. I'm not smart enough.
4;9;Childrick of Mort;Voice;Young, dumb, and orbiting the sun. The greenhouse is in full effect at Planets Only.
4;9;Childrick of Mort;Planet #3;Oh, I want you to split my Pangea into distinct continents.
4;9;Childrick of Mort;Planet #4;I don't have hydrostatic equilibrium yet. Is that something you can learn?
4;9;Childrick of Mort;Voice;You get the idea.
4;9;Childrick of Mort;Rick;Phew!
4;9;Childrick of Mort;Summer;I was watching over your shoulder for a full minute.
4;9;Childrick of Mort;Rick;So? I was watching because it's funny. It's... It's... They... They... They're planets, but they're sexy. It's a comedic premise.
4;9;Childrick of Mort;Summer;Yeah.
4;9;Childrick of Mort;Voice;Planets Only. Planets Only.
4;10;Star Mort: Rickturn Of The Jerri;Space Beth;Get us out of here. I'll hold them off.
4;10;Star Mort: Rickturn Of The Jerri;Space Beth;My name is Beth Smith. Tell your top bugs the Defiance lives on.
4;10;Star Mort: Rickturn Of The Jerri;Gromflomite;I will. I will. I'll make you a legend. Blade Smith.
4;10;Star Mort: Rickturn Of The Jerri;Space Beth;Beth Smith.
4;10;Star Mort: Rickturn Of The Jerri;Gromflomite;Beth. Beth. Beth Smith. Okay, God, it's just such a plain... I'm trying to come up with a mnemonic device.
4;10;Star Mort: Rickturn Of The Jerri;Space Beth;You could connect it to not dying.
4;10;Star Mort: Rickturn Of The Jerri;Gromflomite;"I know, I know! You think that would sear it right in, but it just speaks to the sheer forgettability. Oh, God. I-I-I'm, uh, so sorry. Uh, uh, oh, God. Starts with a B""..."""
4;10;Star Mort: Rickturn Of The Jerri;Gromflomite Newscaster;Congratulations to your government, business, or terror cell on its acquisition of the NX-5 Planet Remover by Xamazax in partnership with Wrangler jeans. The NX-5's industry leading tachyon beams eliminate planets twice as fast as the NX-4S with half the battery and zero built-in fatal design flaws. That's right. No more secret hole that blows the whole thing up when you shoot it. Your enemies will say it's unfair. We say it's about time.
4;10;Star Mort: Rickturn Of The Jerri;Space Beth;Damn it. We risked our lives for that?
4;10;Star Mort: Rickturn Of The Jerri;Rebel Doctor;You did your best. Maybe you need a break. Don't you ever miss Earth?
4;10;Star Mort: Rickturn Of The Jerri;Space Beth;I don't have to miss it. I'm technically still there. My dad made a perfect clone of me to take my place.
4;10;Star Mort: Rickturn Of The Jerri;Rebel Doctor;Boy, that Rick. So, if you do go back, what happens to the clone? Does it have, like, a proximity-triggered device in its neck?
4;10;Star Mort: Rickturn Of The Jerri;Space Beth;Who cares? Are we done?
4;10;Star Mort: Rickturn Of The Jerri;Rebel Doctor;Sure. Unless you want me to remove the proximity-triggered device from your neck. Think it's a bomb? Man, what if this is how you found out he never wanted you back, that he loved the clone more than you? How crazy would that be? Crazy and of... Of course soul-crushing. For you. 
4;10;Star Mort: Rickturn Of The Jerri;Rebel Doctor;I actually have something for that. Y-You want some? They're nonaddictive. That's not true. They're totally addictive. I'm a terrible doctor. I actually have something for that, too. You want some? Nonaddictive. Mmm. I'm a great doctor.
4;10;Star Mort: Rickturn Of The Jerri;Beth;Dr. Wong had a cancellation today. Anybody up for a family session?
4;10;Star Mort: Rickturn Of The Jerri;Summer;I could do that.
4;10;Star Mort: Rickturn Of The Jerri;Morty;I'm... I'm down to clown.
4;10;Star Mort: Rickturn Of The Jerri;Jerry;Ooh, not sure my therapy puppet will be done in time.
4;10;Star Mort: Rickturn Of The Jerri;Beth;Great, because she specifically asked you to stop bringing puppets. Dad?
4;10;Star Mort: Rickturn Of The Jerri;Rick;I love therapy, family therapy most of all, but I am actually disintegrating.
4;10;Star Mort: Rickturn Of The Jerri;Jerry;Oh, my God!
4;10;Star Mort: Rickturn Of The Jerri;Summer;Whoa! Dad!
4;10;Star Mort: Rickturn Of The Jerri;Jerry;Is that really it? We did it?
4;10;Star Mort: Rickturn Of The Jerri;Morty;It's the invisibility belt.
4;10;Star Mort: Rickturn Of The Jerri;Rick;Whoa-whoa-whoa! He grazed them. That's gonna hurt in like 10 seconds. Thanks, Morty.
4;10;Star Mort: Rickturn Of The Jerri;Morty;Why should I let you use it? You never let me use it. 
4;10;Star Mort: Rickturn Of The Jerri;Summer;Can I have the belt? It would really piss off Morty.
4;10;Star Mort: Rickturn Of The Jerri;Rick;Fantastic idea.
4;10;Star Mort: Rickturn Of The Jerri;Morty;What the hell?! You jerk! Give it! Hey! Ow!
4;10;Star Mort: Rickturn Of The Jerri;Beth;Share the invisibility. Jerry?
4;10;Star Mort: Rickturn Of The Jerri;Jerry;Ooh, this looks like a job for Mr. Nibbles. Let me just glue one more eye on.
4;10;Star Mort: Rickturn Of The Jerri;Morty;I'm gonna kill you!
4;10;Star Mort: Rickturn Of The Jerri;Rick;Woof. Looks like you two have to fight about why you can't control your kids. Good thing Dr. Wong's got an opening. Bye.
4;10;Star Mort: Rickturn Of The Jerri;Beth;You're a bad father.
4;10;Star Mort: Rickturn Of The Jerri;Jerry;Don't let him divide us.
4;10;Star Mort: Rickturn Of The Jerri;Rick;Garage, family therapy mode. Ah.
4;10;Star Mort: Rickturn Of The Jerri;Rick;Honey, you're back.
4;10;Star Mort: Rickturn Of The Jerri;Space Beth;You seem surprised.
4;10;Star Mort: Rickturn Of The Jerri;Rick;You never wrote.
4;10;Star Mort: Rickturn Of The Jerri;Space Beth;And never exploded?
4;10;Star Mort: Rickturn Of The Jerri;Rick;What I'm hearing is that you think that's a bomb. 
4;10;Star Mort: Rickturn Of The Jerri;Space Beth;So does every engineer that's seen it.
4;10;Star Mort: Rickturn Of The Jerri;Rick;Engineer? Princess, I'm sure every caveman that sees a microwave calls it a rock cabinet. The point of inventing is to make things that don't exist.
4;10;Star Mort: Rickturn Of The Jerri;Space Beth;Then whip me up a reason not to kill you.
4;10;Star Mort: Rickturn Of The Jerri;Beth;Dad? We're off to Dr. Wong's.
4;10;Star Mort: Rickturn Of The Jerri;Rick;Scan her.
4;10;Star Mort: Rickturn Of The Jerri;Beth;Dad?
4;10;Star Mort: Rickturn Of The Jerri;Rick;Okay, have fun, pumpkin. Sorry I'm a piece-of-shit father.
4;10;Star Mort: Rickturn Of The Jerri;Beth;Oh, ha-ha! Well, the self-loathing buys a lot back. Jerry, leave the puppet.
4;10;Star Mort: Rickturn Of The Jerri;Jerry;It's a one-way ticket to a breakthrough, Beth.
4;10;Star Mort: Rickturn Of The Jerri;Rick;The device in her neck would have transferred a database of her memories to your device before vaporizing her. So much for that plan.
4;10;Star Mort: Rickturn Of The Jerri;Space Beth;Why is she... it... Why am I back with Jerry? I thought she was a copy of me.
4;10;Star Mort: Rickturn Of The Jerri;Rick;She is a copy of you. If she ran back to that dingleberry, that's on you. Want to grab a drink?
4;10;Star Mort: Rickturn Of The Jerri;Space Beth;All the time.
4;10;Star Mort: Rickturn Of The Jerri;Rick;Good girl.
4;10;Star Mort: Rickturn Of The Jerri;Morty;To catch a predator.
4;10;Star Mort: Rickturn Of The Jerri;Summer;Ooh. What the hell?!
4;10;Star Mort: Rickturn Of The Jerri;Morty;Thermal goggles, bitch. Mom said share!
4;10;Star Mort: Rickturn Of The Jerri;Summer;You can't share invisibility. Take those off.
4;10;Star Mort: Rickturn Of The Jerri;Morty;No!
4;10;Star Mort: Rickturn Of The Jerri;Summer;So I'll just see you at cheerleader practice? Should I bring a poncho?
4;10;Star Mort: Rickturn Of The Jerri;Morty;Alright! State your terms.
4;10;Star Mort: Rickturn Of The Jerri;Summer;Give back the belt. You take the goggles. Go away. We trade in an hour.
4;10;Star Mort: Rickturn Of The Jerri;Morty;Deal.
4;10;Star Mort: Rickturn Of The Jerri;Summer;How do you like that, bitch?
4;10;Star Mort: Rickturn Of The Jerri;Morty;I liked it more than my old belt.
4;10;Star Mort: Rickturn Of The Jerri;Summer;"Tiny Big Man Junior""?"""
4;10;Star Mort: Rickturn Of The Jerri;Morty;You should've shared.

4;10;Star Mort: Rickturn Of The Jerri;Summer;Did I wander that far from my console? They should put a warning on these things.
4;10;Star Mort: Rickturn Of The Jerri;Space Beth;So, we overrode the gates, and the slave rebellion took the capital. Pretty cool.
4;10;Star Mort: Rickturn Of The Jerri;Rick;"Very cool. My daughter, having space adventures. They are skewing a tad Star Wars""-y, though. Don't forget to have fun."""
4;10;Star Mort: Rickturn Of The Jerri;Space Beth;Well, I came back to murder you, not get your notes, but I'll remember to fart more while I'm saving the galaxy.
4;10;Star Mort: Rickturn Of The Jerri;Rick;Okay, I'm the one that made this possible. It's not a competition.
4;10;Star Mort: Rickturn Of The Jerri;Space Beth;"Of course not. Just curious, though, if it were, would most wanted"" be first place?"""
4;10;Star Mort: Rickturn Of The Jerri;Rick;You're fighting the Gromflomites?
4;10;Star Mort: Rickturn Of The Jerri;Space Beth;Dad, they're trying to take over the galaxy!
4;10;Star Mort: Rickturn Of The Jerri;Rick;Everybody in the galaxy tries to take over the galaxy. The trick is to be left alone by whoever succeeds. Ah, it's your hero phase. I had one, too. You'll outgrow it.
4;10;Star Mort: Rickturn Of The Jerri;Space Beth;No, you did. I'm not gonna outgrow giving a shit.
4;10;Star Mort: Rickturn Of The Jerri;Tom Randolph;Sources tell us these aliens, who call themselves the New Galactic Federation, will blow up the planet unless some woman with a very boring name gives herself up.
4;10;Star Mort: Rickturn Of The Jerri;Space Beth;Oh, come on.
4;10;Star Mort: Rickturn Of The Jerri;Rick;Way to give a shit. Next time, don't wipe it on your home planet. Oh, shit! They're gonna track down Beth.
4;10;Star Mort: Rickturn Of The Jerri;Space Beth;You mean... Beth's clone.
4;10;Star Mort: Rickturn Of The Jerri;Rick;Right. Beth's clone. What... What did I say? It really was nice seeing you again.
4;10;Star Mort: Rickturn Of The Jerri;Cheerleader;Whoo! Yeah! Go, Honey Bees! Good practice, girls. And remember, we are in a drought, so be sure to shower as one big group at the exact same time.
4;10;Star Mort: Rickturn Of The Jerri;Summer;Shower fire! The shower's on fire! Step aside, girls! I got this!
4;10;Star Mort: Rickturn Of The Jerri;Summer;You're a monster! Still wanna share?
4;10;Star Mort: Rickturn Of The Jerri;Galactic Federation Ship;Morty Smith, hands up. You are under arrest for crimes against the New Improved Galactic Federation. Wait. What? How are you doing that? You're not a psychic, are you? Do you have psychic powers?
4;10;Star Mort: Rickturn Of The Jerri;Morty;Uh, yes.
4;10;Star Mort: Rickturn Of The Jerri;Galactic Federation Ship;Are they strong powers? We're just looking for your mother. You can't, like, stop our hearts, can you?
4;10;Star Mort: Rickturn Of The Jerri;Morty;Uh, I can.
4;10;Star Mort: Rickturn Of The Jerri;Galactic Federation Ship;Okay, we surrender.
4;10;Star Mort: Rickturn Of The Jerri;Dr. Wong;Jerry, do you agree that the use of puppets makes you seem dumb and crazy?
4;10;Star Mort: Rickturn Of The Jerri;Jerry;"I don't think crazy"" is a responsible word to use in..."""
4;10;Star Mort: Rickturn Of The Jerri;Dr. Wong;It is now. This is crazy. You're being crazy.
4;10;Star Mort: Rickturn Of The Jerri;Jerry;They do it in therapy on TV.
4;10;Star Mort: Rickturn Of The Jerri;Dr. Wong;Well, TV gives British people prizes for baking, Jerry.
4;10;Star Mort: Rickturn Of The Jerri;Beth;Tammy? 
4;10;Star Mort: Rickturn Of The Jerri;Jerry;Tonya? Tammya? Tammya.
4;10;Star Mort: Rickturn Of The Jerri;Tammy;Hi, Mrs. Smith. I like your hair better this way. How's the stomach?
4;10;Star Mort: Rickturn Of The Jerri;Beth;What?
4;10;Star Mort: Rickturn Of The Jerri;Jerry;"Hey! I only said hey"". It's not like I can do more than that."""
4;10;Star Mort: Rickturn Of The Jerri;Tammy;As much as I'd like to kill you, my superiors have some questions about the Defiance.
4;10;Star Mort: Rickturn Of The Jerri;Beth;I don't have a... I have a Defiance? Oh, God, I'm a clone.
4;10;Star Mort: Rickturn Of The Jerri;Tammy;That's your defense?
4;10;Star Mort: Rickturn Of The Jerri;Beth;No, my defense is eat me. Ah!
4;10;Star Mort: Rickturn Of The Jerri;Jerry;"Hey! Ah! We've been over this. All I do is say hey."""""
4;10;Star Mort: Rickturn Of The Jerri;Rick;Smart guns, white-list human life. And the therapist.
4;10;Star Mort: Rickturn Of The Jerri;Rick;Tammy, this is the office where my family works to better itself.
4;10;Star Mort: Rickturn Of The Jerri;Tammy;What, and that makes it sacred?
4;10;Star Mort: Rickturn Of The Jerri;Rick;No, it makes it a place I've rigged with a lot of voice-activated escape contingencies. These are all good points. I need to take a long look at myself.
4;10;Star Mort: Rickturn Of The Jerri;Tammy;Aah! Aah!
4;10;Star Mort: Rickturn Of The Jerri;Dr. Wong;I'd like to discuss that.
4;10;Star Mort: Rickturn Of The Jerri;Rick;I don't discuss problems, I incinerate them. Everybody in the car. Everybody in my family, not the world. Jesus, Wong. Boundaries.
4;10;Star Mort: Rickturn Of The Jerri;Dr. Wong;I'm better than this job.
4;10;Star Mort: Rickturn Of The Jerri;Jerry;Can't you just make a portal?
4;10;Star Mort: Rickturn Of The Jerri;Rick;"Your children are down there invisible, Jerry. Make a portal""? Father of the year back here."""
4;10;Star Mort: Rickturn Of The Jerri;Beth;Well, you're one to talk. You told me I wasn't a clone.
4;10;Star Mort: Rickturn Of The Jerri;Rick;Y-You're not a clone.
4;10;Star Mort: Rickturn Of The Jerri;Beth;And who is that?
4;10;Star Mort: Rickturn Of The Jerri;Rick;Uh, uh, a clone.
4;10;Star Mort: Rickturn Of The Jerri;Beth;Why would you make a clone of me just to send the clone into space?
4;10;Star Mort: Rickturn Of The Jerri;Rick;"Well, you didn't want to go, and I thought, Okay, that's cool"". But then I thought, ""Well, you know what would be even cooler is a space daughter"", s-so I made one. And I put a bomb in her neck in case she ever came back."""
4;10;Star Mort: Rickturn Of The Jerri;Jerry;Father of the year.
4;10;Star Mort: Rickturn Of The Jerri;Rick;She wasn't supposed to come back!
4;10;Star Mort: Rickturn Of The Jerri;Beth;Why did she?
4;10;Star Mort: Rickturn Of The Jerri;Rick;Well, she found a bomb in her neck. Wouldn't you?
4;10;Star Mort: Rickturn Of The Jerri;Jerry;Father of the year.
4;10;Star Mort: Rickturn Of The Jerri;Rick;Shut up!
4;10;Star Mort: Rickturn Of The Jerri;Beth;I'm tired of believing you. I want to talk to her.
4;10;Star Mort: Rickturn Of The Jerri;Rick;No, you don't.
4;10;Star Mort: Rickturn Of The Jerri;Beth;Jerry, do something.
4;10;Star Mort: Rickturn Of The Jerri;Jerry;Hey.
4;10;Star Mort: Rickturn Of The Jerri;Beth;He told me you're the clone.
4;10;Star Mort: Rickturn Of The Jerri;Space Beth;What do you think he told me?
4;10;Star Mort: Rickturn Of The Jerri;Beth;You're the clone?
4;10;Star Mort: Rickturn Of The Jerri;Space Beth;Wow, naive and attractive.
4;10;Star Mort: Rickturn Of The Jerri;Beth;Wow, jaded and hot.
4;10;Star Mort: Rickturn Of The Jerri;Rick;I know this is bad parenting, but if you stop fighting, you both get McDonald's.
4;10;Star Mort: Rickturn Of The Jerri;Space Beth;How about I just blow my brains out, starting with hers?
4;10;Star Mort: Rickturn Of The Jerri;Rick;Okay, Wendy's. We love Wendy's. I-I think they even gave us some money.
4;10;Star Mort: Rickturn Of The Jerri;Space Beth;Drop it. Don't move!
4;10;Star Mort: Rickturn Of The Jerri;Gromflomites;Freeze! Get down! On the ground! On the ground! Don't move!
4;10;Star Mort: Rickturn Of The Jerri;Tammy;Everybody, shut up! You're all saying different shit! Wait, so there are two of them?
4;10;Star Mort: Rickturn Of The Jerri;Jerry;More importantly, which one is mine?
4;10;Star Mort: Rickturn Of The Jerri;Rick;Uh, neither, chauvinist.
4;10;Star Mort: Rickturn Of The Jerri;Tammy;Whatever. Take them both.
4;10;Star Mort: Rickturn Of The Jerri;Rick;Cool beam. But let's bargain. I'm the one you really want.
4;10;Star Mort: Rickturn Of The Jerri;Tammy;Excuse me?
4;10;Star Mort: Rickturn Of The Jerri;Rick;Uh, smartest man in the universe? Secret to interdimensional travel? Ask your bosses.
4;10;Star Mort: Rickturn Of The Jerri;Tammy;My bosses are bugs, Rick. You killed the old ones. The new ones are half my age. They know if you're left alone, you're a non-threat.
4;10;Star Mort: Rickturn Of The Jerri;Jerry;Oof-a!
4;10;Star Mort: Rickturn Of The Jerri;Tammy;We got the payload. Fire up the NX-5.mEarth's going ta-ta. You might want to do that thing where you find a new universe where you can suck yourself off.
4;10;Star Mort: Rickturn Of The Jerri;Rick;You can't tell me what to do.
4;10;Star Mort: Rickturn Of The Jerri;Tammy;Awesome. He resisted. We can shoot him. Wha?
4;10;Star Mort: Rickturn Of The Jerri;Rick;Just go with it, Jerry. Everybody, drop your guns... Except for Jerry! Fucking classic.
4;10;Star Mort: Rickturn Of The Jerri;Rick;Holy shit, Morty!
4;10;Star Mort: Rickturn Of The Jerri;Morty;And Summer. W-We worked together. That's... that's our arc!
4;10;Star Mort: Rickturn Of The Jerri;Summer;We went from siblings to invisible to working together.
4;10;Star Mort: Rickturn Of The Jerri;Morty;"It's not Citizen Kane"", but why compete with whatever's going on here, you know?"""
4;10;Star Mort: Rickturn Of The Jerri;Tammy;Unh! Aah!
4;10;Star Mort: Rickturn Of The Jerri;Rick;You made me go to a wedding. And you killed my best friend. I should've said that one first.
4;10;Star Mort: Rickturn Of The Jerri;Galactic Federation Mothership;Congratulations, Earth, on being destroyed by the NX-5, brought to you by Wrangler.
4;10;Star Mort: Rickturn Of The Jerri;Rick;"Ugh, guess the galaxy's most-wanted mammal needs her daddy to come change her diapie. Come on, kids, we have to go do a fucking piece-of-shit Star Wars."""""
4;10;Star Mort: Rickturn Of The Jerri;Gromflomite;Attention, Zeta 99-2. We know you have a stolen ship. Stand down.
4;10;Star Mort: Rickturn Of The Jerri;Rick;Oh, am I not a non-threat now?
4;10;Star Mort: Rickturn Of The Jerri;Gromflomite;Hey, you are not cleared to land. We will open fire. 
4;10;Star Mort: Rickturn Of The Jerri;Rick;Hold your ground, men. You'll be heroes.
4;10;Star Mort: Rickturn Of The Jerri;Rick;Summer, try unlocking that door by scanning your high-school friend's dead face.
4;10;Star Mort: Rickturn Of The Jerri;Jerry;Uh, I have... I have to pee.
4;10;Star Mort: Rickturn Of The Jerri;Rick;Pee on the floor. It's a Death Star.
4;10;Star Mort: Rickturn Of The Jerri;Jerry;Okay, but there's rebellion and then there's...
4;10;Star Mort: Rickturn Of The Jerri;Summer;Here, Dad.
4;10;Star Mort: Rickturn Of The Jerri;Jerry;Perfect.
4;10;Star Mort: Rickturn Of The Jerri;Summer;What am I doing wrong?
4;10;Star Mort: Rickturn Of The Jerri;Rick;Ugh, her eyes are closed. Morty, open the left one. I've got the right. She died the way she lived, overserialized. 
4;10;Star Mort: Rickturn Of The Jerri;Rick;I'm gonna rescue your mom and her clone without revealing which is which. You two find the NX-5 and shut it down. I mean, don't die trying. There's infinite Earths. If you can save this one, it's gravy.
4;10;Star Mort: Rickturn Of The Jerri;Morty; Dream team rides again!
4;10;Star Mort: Rickturn Of The Jerri;Summer;Oh, yeah, we're like Luke and Leia. Uh, except no kissing part. What's another famous brother-sister team?
4;10;Star Mort: Rickturn Of The Jerri;Morty;Uh, Hansel and Gretel?
4;10;Star Mort: Rickturn Of The Jerri;Summer;Yeah, right, those two were fucking. Dad, we need the belt.
4;10;Star Mort: Rickturn Of The Jerri;Jerry;I can't go with you guys watching.
4;10;Star Mort: Rickturn Of The Jerri;Morty;You're invisible!
4;10;Star Mort: Rickturn Of The Jerri;Jerry;What if the pee isn't?
4;10;Star Mort: Rickturn Of The Jerri;Morty;You know what? We don't need invisibility. Working together is our belt.
4;10;Star Mort: Rickturn Of The Jerri;Summer;That's our arc. Let's do it.
4;10;Star Mort: Rickturn Of The Jerri;Morty;I'm gonna go ahead and whistle. That's how good I feel.
4;10;Star Mort: Rickturn Of The Jerri;Jerry;Oh, God. I knew it. Ugh, this floor isn't level.
4;10;Star Mort: Rickturn Of The Jerri;Beth;Are they gonna torture us?
4;10;Star Mort: Rickturn Of The Jerri;Space Beth;Unless you plan on telling them what I know. Last chance to guess who was the clone.
4;10;Star Mort: Rickturn Of The Jerri;Beth;You're his daughter. Just something about the eyes, the shameless abandonment of your family.
4;10;Star Mort: Rickturn Of The Jerri;Space Beth;How ever can I live with myself? One theory... I was designed by your father to live with myself, which would mean you made a conscious choice to swallow your dreams with cheap wine and dinosaur pasta.
4;10;Star Mort: Rickturn Of The Jerri;Beth;You know that's the kind Jerry likes, same way I know the only Goddamn dream you'll ever follow is your shitty father's approval.
4;10;Star Mort: Rickturn Of The Jerri;Space Beth;You fetch your shitty father's lemonade.
4;10;Star Mort: Rickturn Of The Jerri;Beth;You cosplay as your shitty father in his 30s.
4;10;Star Mort: Rickturn Of The Jerri;Voice;Red alert. Red alert. Rick Sanchez... 
4;10;Star Mort: Rickturn Of The Jerri;Rick;More like dead alert. What else? What else? I wrote some stuff down in my Notes app. Let me just find it. Screw it. Beth, if... if one of you is still alive, you're my real daughter. If you're both alive, don't hurt the other one. She's just a clone. She's not worth it. I'm coming, baby.
4;10;Star Mort: Rickturn Of The Jerri;Space Beth;That piece of shit.
4;10;Star Mort: Rickturn Of The Jerri;Beth;What a piece of shit.
4;10;Star Mort: Rickturn Of The Jerri;Space Beth;I came back to kill him, you know. 
4;10;Star Mort: Rickturn Of The Jerri;Beth;I'd like to help.
4;10;Star Mort: Rickturn Of The Jerri;Space Beth;Kick me between my eyes.
4;10;Star Mort: Rickturn Of The Jerri;Beth;From here?
4;10;Star Mort: Rickturn Of The Jerri;Space Beth;Oh, you dropped yoga so you could buy Jerry more Flintstones Vitam...
4;10;Star Mort: Rickturn Of The Jerri;Rick;Oh, I do not like the looks of this giant fight chamber.
4;10;Star Mort: Rickturn Of The Jerri;Rick;Birdperson?
4;10;Star Mort: Rickturn Of The Jerri;Phoenixperson;It is now Phoenixperson.
4;10;Star Mort: Rickturn Of The Jerri;Rick;You're working for them? What did they do to you, BP?
4;10;Star Mort: Rickturn Of The Jerri;Phoenixperson;It is now PP. Where is Tammy?
4;10;Star Mort: Rickturn Of The Jerri;Rick;Oh, don't worry about her. I killed her.
4;10;Star Mort: Rickturn Of The Jerri;Phoenixperson;I loved her.
4;10;Star Mort: Rickturn Of The Jerri;Rick;Really? Huh. Then can I suggest, as an alternate name, Crazy Pussy-Whipped Person?
4;10;Star Mort: Rickturn Of The Jerri;Rick;It's funny. I always wondered who would win if we ever fought.
4;10;Star Mort: Rickturn Of The Jerri;Phoenixperson;Then you were always a bad friend.
4;10;Star Mort: Rickturn Of The Jerri;Summer;Morty, we had one grenade.
4;10;Star Mort: Rickturn Of The Jerri;Morty;He had a gun.
4;10;Star Mort: Rickturn Of The Jerri;Summer;Whatever. Come on.
4;10;Star Mort: Rickturn Of The Jerri;Gromflomite #1;Did you hear something? 
4;10;Star Mort: Rickturn Of The Jerri;Gromflomite #2;Doesn't matter. If anyone's around, they're here to stop the laser, and they can't do it without us seeing them.

4;10;Star Mort: Rickturn Of The Jerri;Morty;You gave it away!

4;10;Star Mort: Rickturn Of The Jerri;Gromflomite #2;The NX-5 can't destroy Wrangler jeans.
4;10;Star Mort: Rickturn Of The Jerri;Gromflomite #1;Like, it literally can't destroy them or it's programmed not to?
4;10;Star Mort: Rickturn Of The Jerri;Gromflomite #2;Gee, what do you think?
4;10;Star Mort: Rickturn Of The Jerri;Space Beth;You kill a good bug, for a horse doctor.
4;10;Star Mort: Rickturn Of The Jerri;Beth;"Thanks, me. Maybe we could do, like, a Parent Trap"" thing together sometime."""
4;10;Star Mort: Rickturn Of The Jerri;Space Beth;As long as you mean the Lindsay Lohan version.
4;10;Star Mort: Rickturn Of The Jerri;Beth;Naturally.
4;10;Star Mort: Rickturn Of The Jerri;Gromflomite #1;What do you think they do with all those jeans? Make them into jackets?
4;10;Star Mort: Rickturn Of The Jerri;Gromflomite #2;"It's not about conserving denim. It's marketing. Like, uh, The NX-5 destroys the whole planet, except for the Wrangler jeans."""""
4;10;Star Mort: Rickturn Of The Jerri;Gromflomite #1;'Cause they're so tough. Tougher than the laser? Stupid.
4;10;Star Mort: Rickturn Of The Jerri;Gromflomite #2;You're talking about it.
4;10;Star Mort: Rickturn Of The Jerri;Gromflomite #1;Mm, you're right. They... They got me.
4;10;Star Mort: Rickturn Of The Jerri;Morty;Hey, over here! Look at me!
4;10;Star Mort: Rickturn Of The Jerri;Gromflomite #1;Did you just see a pantsless little boy run by?
4;10;Star Mort: Rickturn Of The Jerri;Gromflomite #2;I'm not falling for that again.
4;10;Star Mort: Rickturn Of The Jerri;Morty;I used to be invisible, but now I'm the opposite.
4;10;Star Mort: Rickturn Of The Jerri;Gromflomite #2;Get him. But not in a weird way.
4;10;Star Mort: Rickturn Of The Jerri;Gromflomite #1;You made it weird.
4;10;Star Mort: Rickturn Of The Jerri;Voice;NX-5 corporate sponsor detected. Cannot penetrate Wranglers. Built too tough. Built... too... tough.
4;10;Star Mort: Rickturn Of The Jerri;Morty;I killed them! I-I did... I did it offscreen.
4;10;Star Mort: Rickturn Of The Jerri;Summer;God damn it. Morty, fix your underwear. I saw your balls for a second.
4;10;Star Mort: Rickturn Of The Jerri;Morty;That's on you.
4;10;Star Mort: Rickturn Of The Jerri;Gromflomite #3;Why can't I meet your parents? Are you embarrassed of me?
4;10;Star Mort: Rickturn Of The Jerri;Gromflomite #4;No, of them.
4;10;Star Mort: Rickturn Of The Jerri;Gromflomite #3;Aww.
4;10;Star Mort: Rickturn Of The Jerri;Rick;Never thought this was how I'd die. We're nowhere near Venice, and you're not a dwarf in a raincoat.
4;10;Star Mort: Rickturn Of The Jerri;Space Beth;Step back. You're not killing him till we kick his ass, Birdperson.
4;10;Star Mort: Rickturn Of The Jerri;Phoenixperson;My name is Phoenixperson.
4;10;Star Mort: Rickturn Of The Jerri;Beth;No one's calling you that. Dumb.
4;10;Star Mort: Rickturn Of The Jerri;Phoenixperson;It fascinates me that an entire family can be this critical and suck this much. Aah!
4;10;Star Mort: Rickturn Of The Jerri;Jerry;Birdperson, stop. It's me, that Tammy girl.
4;10;Star Mort: Rickturn Of The Jerri;Phoenixperson;Tammy, this is unexpected. I was told you were dead.
4;10;Star Mort: Rickturn Of The Jerri;Jerry;That is ab-so-lute-ly not true. I'm more alive than I've ever been!
4;10;Star Mort: Rickturn Of The Jerri;Phoenixperson;You are behaving rather strangely.
4;10;Star Mort: Rickturn Of The Jerri;Jerry;Me? Strange? Oh, my. Well, who's normal, really? Now, come here, you big hollow-boned featherhead. Let me give you some of this sweet ass.
4;10;Star Mort: Rickturn Of The Jerri;Beth;Saved the day with puppeting. Only one with a decent arc.
4;10;Star Mort: Rickturn Of The Jerri;Space Beth;He does have his moments.
4;10;Star Mort: Rickturn Of The Jerri;Summer;Mom, Dad! Mom. Uh, we did it! Morty became super visible!
4;10;Star Mort: Rickturn Of The Jerri;Morty;Summer put my jeans in a laser!
4;10;Star Mort: Rickturn Of The Jerri;Beth;Morty, look at your little balls!
4;10;Star Mort: Rickturn Of The Jerri;Morty;I know!
4;10;Star Mort: Rickturn Of The Jerri;Beth;Bring it in here, guys.
4;10;Star Mort: Rickturn Of The Jerri;Morty;Damn, this thing has twin turbines? I'll forgive you for abandoning us if you let me drive it.
4;10;Star Mort: Rickturn Of The Jerri;Space Beth;That works for me... I was just gonna give you space cigarettes.
4;10;Star Mort: Rickturn Of The Jerri;Summer;I love having two moms.
4;10;Star Mort: Rickturn Of The Jerri;Jerry;And I love having two wives!
4;10;Star Mort: Rickturn Of The Jerri;Rick;Never gonna happen, Jerry. You jerk-offs ready to get the answers to your burning questions?
4;10;Star Mort: Rickturn Of The Jerri;Space Beth;What's this, Dad?
4;10;Star Mort: Rickturn Of The Jerri;Rick;The memory of which Beth is real and which Beth is a clone, obviously.
4;10;Star Mort: Rickturn Of The Jerri;Space Beth;You mind-blew yourself? You... You literally don't even know which of your daughters is real. Of course you don't. Why am I surprised?
4;10;Star Mort: Rickturn Of The Jerri;Beth;I'm sure you'd love for us to need that from you, but I don't care what's in that vial.
4;10;Star Mort: Rickturn Of The Jerri;Space Beth;Yeah, me neither. You're a piece of shit either way.
4;10;Star Mort: Rickturn Of The Jerri;Rick;So what, after all this, you don't want to know the truth?
4;10;Star Mort: Rickturn Of The Jerri;Space Beth;The truth is we have more important shit to do like raise our kids and stamp out the Federation, neither of which seem like they want anything to do with you.
4;10;Star Mort: Rickturn Of The Jerri;Rick;Morty? Sum-Sum? You gotta at least wanna know who your real mom is.
4;10;Star Mort: Rickturn Of The Jerri;Morty;Not really, Rick. We have two badass moms now. It's kind of a win/win.
4;10;Star Mort: Rickturn Of The Jerri;Summer;Yeah, Grandpa Rick, don't drag us into your bullshit, just because you're losing control.
4;10;Star Mort: Rickturn Of The Jerri;Beth;I know what I want to do. I want you to decide.
4;10;Star Mort: Rickturn Of The Jerri;Rick;What?
4;10;Star Mort: Rickturn Of The Jerri;Beth;For once in my life, I want you to decide, Dad. Do you want me to stay here and be part of your life, or do you want me to leave?
4;10;Star Mort: Rickturn Of The Jerri;Rick;Holy shit. I'm a terrible father. 
4;10;Star Mort: Rickturn Of The Jerri;Rick;At least I'm a pretty good friend. Looks like it's just you and me, buddy. Okay, alright, we'll give you a little more time.
4;10;Star Mort: Rickturn Of The Jerri;Jerry;Ah, goodbye, old friend. We've had our fun, but I'm ready to be seen again.
4;10;Star Mort: Rickturn Of The Jerri;Garbage Truck Driver;What the fuck?! Oh, my God! Where did I go?
4;10;Star Mort: Rickturn Of The Jerri;Jerry;Oh, shitskis.
4;10;Star Mort: Rickturn Of The Jerri;Garbage Truck Driver;Aah!
4;10;Star Mort: Rickturn Of The Jerri;Jerry;Slow down! There's an invisible garbage truck in the road!
4;10;Star Mort: Rickturn Of The Jerri;Driver;Yeah, right.
4;10;Star Mort: Rickturn Of The Jerri;Driver;I'm alive. I survi...
4;10;Star Mort: Rickturn Of The Jerri;Jerry;I mean, when in Rome.
