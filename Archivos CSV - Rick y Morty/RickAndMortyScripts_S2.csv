2;1;A Rickle In Time;Summer;Hurry up Morty, Grampa's about to unfreeze time. You know you really should be cleaning from top to bottom.
2;1;A Rickle In Time;Morty;I know how to vacuum Mom and Dad, Summer, I've been doing it for six months!
2;1;A Rickle In Time;Summer;Then you've been doing it wrong for six months. Oh, my God, is that mildew?
2;1;A Rickle In Time;Morty;It's not my fault we froze time on a humid day!
2;1;A Rickle In Time;Summer;You have dropped so many balls, man. Do you ever get scared Grampa Rick might make me his new sidekick?
2;1;A Rickle In Time;Morty;What? What kind of monster are you?
2;1;A Rickle In Time;Summer;A competent one.
2;1;A Rickle In Time;Rick;Who cares about the thing you guys are talking about? The whole point of freezing time is to stop giving a fuck. Put a shirt on your dumb dad and let's get this dumb universe rolling. Let's do this thing.
2;1;A Rickle In Time;Rick;Alright, listen, you two, we froze time for a pretty long time, so when I unfreeze it, the world's time is gonna be fine, but our time's gonna need a little time to, you know, stabilize.
2;1;A Rickle In Time;Morty;Our time is gonna be unstable? What does that even mean?
2;1;A Rickle In Time;Rick;It means relax and stop being a pussy, Morty. I thought you learned that by now. It also means don't touch your parents or we could shatter into countless theoretical shards.
2;1;A Rickle In Time;Morty;Wait a minute, what?
2;1;A Rickle In Time;Rick;And away we go!
2;1;A Rickle In Time;Morty;Uh, did we ever put that mattress under Mr. Benson?
2;1;A Rickle In Time;Rick;Shhh, Morty!
2;1;A Rickle In Time;Jerry;...A THING OR TWO ABOUT... wait, what? Was the house...? When we pulled up I could have sworn the house was completely trashed.
2;1;A Rickle In Time;Rick;Negative visualization, Jerry. It explains a lot about where you're at. Hi, sweety.
2;1;A Rickle In Time;Beth;Hi, dad.
2;1;A Rickle In Time;Beth;Summer, Morty, are you okay?
2;1;A Rickle In Time;Morty;W-We just missed you a lot.
2;1;A Rickle In Time;Summer;Yeah, we missed you so much. Too much to hug you though.
2;1;A Rickle In Time;Rick;Yeah it would literally destroy them. Now listen, why do—why do—why—why don't you guys go get a free Sundae ice cream, go out there and get some ice creams. Here's five hundred dollars cash in unmarked moneys. I'm just gonna put it on the floor and uh, kick it on over to ya. You guys go nuts.
2;1;A Rickle In Time;Jerry;This better not be a bribe. If I find a single thing out of place in this house, my love of ice cream won't save you. I'll get my jacket.
2;1;A Rickle In Time;Beth;Sweety, is your shirt on backwards?
2;1;A Rickle In Time;Morty;Oh!
2;1;A Rickle In Time;Rick;Uh oh.
2;1;A Rickle In Time;Jerry;Yeah, I like it this way. I'm not stupid.
2;1;A Rickle In Time;Morty;Phew...
2;1;A Rickle In Time;Rick;Man that guy is the Red Grin Grumble to pretending he knows what's going on. Oh you agree, huh?
2;1;A Rickle In Time;Summer;Funny.
2;1;A Rickle In Time;Rick;You like that Red Grin Grumble reference?
2;1;A Rickle In Time;Summer;Yeah.
2;1;A Rickle In Time;Rick;Well guess what? I made him up. You really are your father's children. Think for yourselves, don't be sheep.
2;1;A Rickle In Time;Summer;God, I feel terrible.
2;1;A Rickle In Time;Rick;Yup, it really makes you appreciate how fickle the universe can be. One minute you're falling off a roof for six months, the next minute, bam!
2;1;A Rickle In Time;Morty;Uh, just to be clear, it was Summer's job to put the mattress under-
2;1;A Rickle In Time;Summer;Uh, what? It was your job, Morty.
2;1;A Rickle In Time;Morty;Nuh uh!
2;1;A Rickle In Time;Summer;Yeah huh!
2;1;A Rickle In Time;Rick;Actually, sorry Summer, I gotta back the M bomb on this one. I remember the conversation. We told Morty to replace all the bank's money with cookies, your job was to put the mattress under Mr. Benson.
2;1;A Rickle In Time;Morty;Boom! In your face Summer! You really dropped the ball, man.
2;1;A Rickle In Time;Summer;Shut up Morty, you vindictive little turd!
2;1;A Rickle In Time;Morty;You shut up you big... female asshole!
2;1;A Rickle In Time;Morty;Hey, don't shove me!
2;1;A Rickle In Time;Summer;I didn't!
2;1;A Rickle In Time;Morty;You didn't what?
2;1;A Rickle In Time;Summer;What's your problem?
2;1;A Rickle In Time;Morty;What's yours?
2;1;A Rickle In Time;Summer;Shut up!
2;1;A Rickle In Time;Morty;You shut up!
2;1;A Rickle In Time;Rick;Whoa whoa wh-what the hell hell hell hell hell?
2;1;A Rickle In Time;Both Ricks;Oh God, oh no, what did you guys just do?
2;1;A Rickle In Time;Summer 1;What do you mean?
2;1;A Rickle In Time;Summer 2;What could we do?
2;1;A Rickle In Time;BothAll Summers;Wait, what am I saying?
2;1;A Rickle In Time;Rick;Were either of you guys uncertain about anything just now?
2;1;A Rickle In Time;BothAll Mortys;Oh man... I don't feel good.
2;1;A Rickle In Time;Morty 1;Am I me? I think so.
2;1;A Rickle In Time;Morty 2;A-am I talking right now?
2;1;A Rickle In Time;BothAll Mortys;Wait, who said that?
2;1;A Rickle In Time;BothAll Ricks;Alright both of you, just don't move, don't speak, don't think. I have to check something.
2;1;A Rickle In Time;Summer 1;What should we do Morty?
2;1;A Rickle In Time;Summer 2;I'm gonna help Grampa.
2;1;A Rickle In Time;Morty 1;Let's see if he needs help.
2;1;A Rickle In Time;Morty 2;What do you mean you're gonna help him.
2;1;A Rickle In Time;Summer 1;Ugh, I can help too.
2;1;A Rickle In Time;BothAll Mortys;What's going on Rick?
2;1;A Rickle In Time;BothAll Summers;What's happening Grampa?
2;1;A Rickle In Time;BothAll Ricks;Shut up! Oh crap are you kidding me? Two dots? This never needs to be more than one dot. The two of you made us uncertain!
2;1;A Rickle In Time;Morty 1;What do you mean?
2;1;A Rickle In Time;Morty 2;What? In English?
2;1;A Rickle In Time;Summer 1;What? English please?
2;1;A Rickle In Time;Summer 2;What are you talking about?
2;1;A Rickle In Time;BothAll Ricks;Our time is fractured. You two somehow created a feedback loop of uncertainty that's split our reality into two equally possible impossibilities. W-we're exactly like a man capable of sustaining a platonic friendship with an attractive female co-worker. We're entirely hypothetical.
2;1;A Rickle In Time;BothAll Mortys;But I thought there were infinite timelines.
2;1;A Rickle In Time;BothAll Ricks;We're not on any timeline, dummy. Look.
2;1;A Rickle In Time;BothAll Mortys;Oh, my God!
2;1;A Rickle In Time;BothAll Summers;Are those cats?
2;1;A Rickle In Time;Both Ricks;I assume they're Schrödinger's cats. A-actually, I assume they both are and aren't, just like us.
2;1;A Rickle In Time;Summer 1 & Morty 2;Is the world gone? Where are Mom and Dad?
2;1;A Rickle In Time;Both Ricks;“Mom and Dad?” Get your head out of your family's ass. The three of us are lost in a timeless oblivion. Your parents get to exist. They're probably living it up in some pointless grounded story about their shitty marriage.
2;1;A Rickle In Time;Jerry;Cold Stone Creamery is the best. What should we do with our remaining twenty dollars?
2;1;A Rickle In Time;Beth;You realize they sing no matter how much you tip.
2;1;A Rickle In Time;Beth;Holy shit! What happened?
2;1;A Rickle In Time;Jerry;I hit a deer! W-we have to tell the cops you were driving.
2;1;A Rickle In Time;Beth;W-what?
2;1;A Rickle In Time;Jerry;This is Rum Raisin!
2;1;A Rickle In Time;Beth;It's still alive.
2;1;A Rickle In Time;Jerry;Well, do we- do I uh, get a big rock? Or--
2;1;A Rickle In Time;Beth;It's not an armadillo, asshole!
2;1;A Rickle In Time;Jerry;I thought that's what a man's supposed to say, it's not like I could have actually done it.
2;1;A Rickle In Time;Beth;If we were near a hospital, I could treat it, but I-I think we have to just-
2;1;A Rickle In Time;Jerry;It's okay, this is just something that happens. And even if we were in a hospital, what could we do, you're a horse surgeon, not a deer surgeon.
2;1;A Rickle In Time;Beth;So...
2;1;A Rickle In Time;Jerry;Well don't different animals-
2;1;A Rickle In Time;Beth;Require different levels of skill to keep alive?
2;1;A Rickle In Time;Jerry;Oh God...
2;1;A Rickle In Time;Beth;Get the deer in the car, Jerry.
2;1;A Rickle In Time;Jerry;Yes Beth.
2;1;A Rickle In Time;Both Ricks;This is why you don't freeze time, you guys. It's incredibly irresponsible.
2;1;A Rickle In Time;Morty 1;And you did it so you could clean the house after a party.
2;1;A Rickle In Time;Morty 2;And you did it so you could clean the house after a party?
2;1;A Rickle In Time;Both Ricks;Look, there's no time to hold me accountable, Morty. Like literally no time. Look around. Uncertainty is inherently unsustainable. Eventually everything either is or isn't. And we've got about four hours to be “is”.
2;1;A Rickle In Time;Morty 1;Or...
2;1;A Rickle In Time;Morty 2;Or?
2;1;A Rickle In Time;Both Ricks;We “isn't”.
2;1;A Rickle In Time;Both Ricks;Alright, since this time crystal exists in both possibilities, and since it's impossible that I didn't nail this, I'm probably about to press this button in both possibilities at exactly the same time.
2;1;A Rickle In Time;Morty 1 & Summer 2;How do you know you're gonna-
2;1;A Rickle In Time;Both Ricks;Whatever you're asking, the answer is I'm amazing. And away we go!
2;1;A Rickle In Time;Both Ricks;Huh, what do you know, it's working.
2;1;A Rickle In Time;Summer 1;Ow, ow ouch!
2;1;A Rickle In Time;Morty 2;Whoa, ow, ow.
2;1;A Rickle In Time;Both Ricks;Oh shit.
2;1;A Rickle In Time;All Ricks;What the hell is wrong with you two!? I—I m—I m—I mean you four!?
2;1;A Rickle In Time;All Mortys and Summer 2;That hurt! That was painful...
2;1;A Rickle In Time;All Ricks;Good I'm glad it was painful. You do deserve it! I saw you, you're both all over the damn place. We've been split for twenty minutes and your lives are already scattered to the quantum fucking wind? What the hell do either of you have to be so uncertain about? Your brand of zit cream? Which chair to sit in while I do everything? Come on, spit it out!
2;1;A Rickle In Time;All Mortys;Well you don't exactly make it easy, Rick!
2;1;A Rickle In Time;Morty 1;You make fun of me all the time and now Summer's doing it too!
2;1;A Rickle In Time;Morty 2;You're always picking on me and now you got someone to kiss your ass!
2;1;A Rickle In Time;Summer 1;Me? What about you? Would you get more excited to see me fail? You want Grampa all to yourself!
2;1;A Rickle In Time;Summer 2;Me? You're just as mean to me because you're jealous, because you want Grampa all to yourself!
2;1;A Rickle In Time;All Ricks;Alright, cool it, I see what's happening here. You're both young, you're both unsure about your place in the universe, you both wanna be “Grampa's favorite.” I can fix this. Morty sit here, Summer, you sit here. Now listen, I know the two of you are very different from each other in a lot of ways, but you have to understand that as far as Grampa's concerned, you're both pieces of shit. Yeah, I can prove it mathematically. Actually, let me grab my whiteboard. This has been a long time coming anyway.
2;1;A Rickle In Time;Beth;Emergency, wounded deer coming in.
2;1;A Rickle In Time;Vet;Three. Excuse me, you can't be back here.
2;1;A Rickle In Time;Beth;I'm a certified horse surgeon, and this deer needs medical attention. Nurse, please move that snake.
2;1;A Rickle In Time;Vet;That's my nurse, and as a horse surgeon, I'm sure that you know that deer have much smaller, much more intricate organs-
2;1;A Rickle In Time;Beth;As a vet, I'm sure you know a deer is closer to a horse than you are to a doctor, so let's save the measuring for when our dicks are out, it's time to save a life!
2;1;A Rickle In Time;Vet;Geez...
2;1;A Rickle In Time;Beth;That's odd, this deer's wounded.
2;1;A Rickle In Time;Jerry;Uh, yeah, I was there, you don't have to rub it in.
2;1;A Rickle In Time;Beth;I mean it's been shot. With a gun.
2;1;A Rickle In Time;Hunter;My gun.
2;1;A Rickle In Time;Vet;May I help you, sir?
2;1;A Rickle In Time;Hunter;No, but you can stop helping this deer. I shot it before these two hit it with their car and I followed them when they hauled it off. This deer belongs to me.
2;1;A Rickle In Time;Beth;We don't have time for this, okay! I need anesthetic, and deer saline!
2;1;A Rickle In Time;Vet;Look, I don't know what the law says about this, but I took an oath that I would let no animal come to harm. Except when sterilizing, aborting or euthenizing them and also when eating them at almost any meal.
2;1;A Rickle In Time;Hunter;I'm calling my lawyer. I hope for all our sakes you're as bad a surgeon as I am a hunter.
2;1;A Rickle In Time;Beth;In your dreams, bitch! Scalpel!
2;1;A Rickle In Time;All Ricks;So in conclusion, you're both equally mercurial, overly sensitive, clingy hysterical bird brained homunculi. And I honestly can't tell the two of you half the time because I don't go by height or age, I go by amount of pain in my ass, which makes you both identical. Alright, everything resolved? Everybody nice and certain about their position in my world?
2;1;A Rickle In Time;All Mortys and All Summers;Yes.
2;1;A Rickle In Time;All Ricks;Alright, perfect. Sit still, arms down, I'm gonna do this again, this time, be like Grampa.
2;1;A Rickle In Time;Morty 2;You mean drunk?
2;1;A Rickle In Time;Rick 2;What's that? You got something to say?
2;1;A Rickle In Time;Rick 1;And away we go!
2;1;A Rickle In Time;Morty 2;No.
2;1;A Rickle In Time;Rick 2;And away we go!
2;1;A Rickle In Time;All Ricks;Huh, that's weird. Oh, my God.
2;1;A Rickle In Time;All Summers; What?
2;1;A Rickle In Time;All Ricks;That son of a bitch is gonna kill me!
2;1;A Rickle In Time;Rick 2;Follicle unfeeling sociopath. Don't you get it? He thinks he can save his own skin by using the crystal to kill me. He probably figures it's easier to eliminate one of the possibilities rather than merge them. I have to admit, it's always in the back of my mind too. The difference is I would never do it! Until now...
2;1;A Rickle In Time;Rick 1;Don't you get it? don't you get it? The other Rick isn't trying to merge us anymore. He thinks he can save his own skin by using the crystal to kill me. He probably figures it's easier to eliminate one of the possibilities rather than merge them. I have to admit, it's always in the back of my mind too. The difference is I would never do it! Until now...
2;1;A Rickle In Time;All Mortys;Rick what the hell are you doing?
2;1;A Rickle In Time;All Ricks;Saving our lives. After he takes me out he's gonna be coming for you!
2;1;A Rickle In Time;All Summers;Who?
2;1;A Rickle In Time;All Ricks;Me!
2;1;A Rickle In Time;Rick 2;You see that? Get down.
2;1;A Rickle In Time;All Summers;Ahh!
2;1;A Rickle In Time;All Mortys;Whoa whoa!
2;1;A Rickle In Time;Rick 1;I told you he's a psycho!
2;1;A Rickle In Time;Rick 2;He's lost it. The time fracture must have made him crazy!
2;1;A Rickle In Time;Rick 1;I don't know what to do! I don't know what to do!
2;1;A Rickle In Time;Summer 2 or 4 after splitting into 4;Oh crap!
2;1;A Rickle In Time;All Ricks;Oh God, now there's three of them, we're outnumbered! Get in the cupboards! Wait, don't don't do that, they'll know... wait wait, think about getting in the cupboards but don't really. AAAAH! IS THIS WHAT YOU WANT YOU SICK FUCKS? YOU WANNA SEE CHILDREN DIE?
2;1;A Rickle In Time;Beth;You son of a bitch, you don't stop living until I SAY SO!
2;1;A Rickle In Time;Lawyer;Michael.
2;1;A Rickle In Time;Vet;Who's this now?
2;1;A Rickle In Time;Hunter;My lawyer.
2;1;A Rickle In Time;Lawyer;I'm here to notify you ma'am, that in this county, any deer shot by a hunter is that hunter's property, regardless of how far it runs, or who intercepts it before it dies. It's called Brad's law. We can't make you stop the surgery, but at this point you're performing it on venison.
2;1;A Rickle In Time;Hunter;Actually, I've decided not to eat it. All this fear and conflict. I'm sure it's ruined the meat. I'm just gonna use the head for my rec room wall.
2;1;A Rickle In Time;Jerry;She normally works on horses.
2;1;A Rickle In Time;Beth;Jerry, if you're not gonna help, get the fuck out of here! I will reach into heaven and yank your screaming deer soul back!
2;1;A Rickle In Time;Vet;Jesus...
2;1;A Rickle In Time;All Ricks;Shh shh... I know where you are, you creepy old monster... I know how you think! Oh, is this where you think I'm going? You think I'm standing here? Well maybe you're right!
2;1;A Rickle In Time;All Summers;Holy shit, now what?
2;1;A Rickle In Time;All Mortys;Well if all of me knocked out all the Ricks, and you peed in all of your pants, doesn't that mean that we're all synchronized?
2;1;A Rickle In Time;All Summers;Right.
2;1;A Rickle In Time;All Mortys;Okay... so from now on, whatever we do we have to be certain.
2;1;A Rickle In Time;All Summers;Right...
2;1;A Rickle In Time;All Mortys;I think I'm certain we're F'd in the A.
2;1;A Rickle In Time;All Ricks;Oh God, my head. What did you guys do?
2;1;A Rickle In Time;All Mortys;We put you in a dog crate because you were acting crazy, and you caused another time fracture.
2;1;A Rickle In Time;All Summers;You tried to kill yourself!
2;1;A Rickle In Time;All Ricks;Only in self defense, myself tried to kill me first! Guys, I don't expect you to understand this, but time breaking twice means our problem is two times bigger and we've got half as much time to solve it. Well actually, I do expect you to understand that, it's basic math. C-could someone just let me out of here? If I die in a cage I lose a bet.
2;1;A Rickle In Time;All Summers;Well is there some way you can prove you're not a threat to yourself and others anymore?
2;1;A Rickle In Time;All Ricks;Ah, for God's sake, alright here, give me the time crystal.
2;1;A Rickle In Time;All Mortys;W-what're you doing?
2;1;A Rickle In Time;All Ricks;Calling myself. Here, listen, it'll probably go to voice mail since, you know, I'm calling myself.
2;1;A Rickle In Time;All Rick phones;" ""Hello"
2;1;A Rickle In Time;All Ricks;Don't fall for it, it's a bit.
2;1;A Rickle In Time;All Rick phones;Just kidding, haha! You just got Ricked. You've reached Rick's voicemail, you know what to do.
2;1;A Rickle In Time;All Ricks;Hey Rick, it's Rick. Listen, I'm sorry about earlier. No hard feelings. I know you know I mean it too. Take it easy. Whoa. Damn, look at this, I'm blown up. Three new voicemails. Yeah yeah, I heard this one. You get the idea we're cool now.
2;1;A Rickle In Time;All Summers;Okay, well we're still not gonna let you out of this crate.
2;1;A Rickle In Time;All Ricks;Fine I'll just do it myself.
2;1;A Rickle In Time;All Mortys;If you could get out that whole time why didn't you?
2;1;A Rickle In Time;All Ricks;Because I waited until I was certain it was what I wanted to do, Morty. That's the difference between you and me. I'm certain, and you're a walking burlap sack filled with turds.
2;1;A Rickle In Time;All Mortys;You know, geez Rick, y—y—you're really tearing into me right now. You know, words hurt.
2;1;A Rickle In Time;Morty 1;Oh, my God!
2;1;A Rickle In Time;Morty 2;It's a monster!
2;1;A Rickle In Time;Morty 3;Oh, my God! It's a monster!
2;1;A Rickle In Time;Summer 1;It's a monster!
2;1;A Rickle In Time;Summer 4;It's a monster!
2;1;A Rickle In Time;Testicle Monster A;Ey, ye ey, quit yellin' quit yellin'.
2;1;A Rickle In Time;Summer 4;Oh, my God...
2;1;A Rickle In Time;Testicle Monster A;What the fuck?! Your time is all ripped up to hell! You broke your time, twice!
2;1;A Rickle In Time;Testicle Monster A;How did this happen?
2;1;A Rickle In Time;Summers 2 & 3;Yeah, but we don't even know, the first time...
2;1;A Rickle In Time;Morty 1 & 4;Who's that Brother Newman time elf?
2;1;A Rickle In Time;Testicle Monster A;Shut the fuck up! Oh, damn, I'm from the 4th dimension. I can hear all o' y'all. Now let's just see what we got here for a second.
2;1;A Rickle In Time;Testicle Monster A;Ay, damn it, were you tryin' to use this to- oh, see, you broke time, and you thought you could just stick it back together with this? How you think you gonna move time while you're standin in it you dumn ass three-dimensional monkey ass dummies?
2;1;A Rickle In Time;All Mortys;Oh way to go, Rick.
2;1;A Rickle In Time;All Summers;Yeah Grampa, way to go.
2;1;A Rickle In Time;All Ricks;Oh, what you're just gonna listen to this guy now? He's got a giant testicle for a head! He came here in a bubble. For all we know he could be the David Berkowitz of Nutsack Land.
2;1;A Rickle In Time;Testicle Monster A;Shut up. Here, put these on. They'll sync your possibilities up so I can bring you back to certain time. Y'all just-just negligent, now ay, ay, ay, the three of you, put your collars on!
2;1;A Rickle In Time;Rick 4;We're not wearing collars.
2;1;A Rickle In Time;Testicle Monster A;Exactly, because you're being obstinate.
2;1;A Rickle In Time;Rick 4;Alright, fine. Summer, Morty, put 'em on.
2;1;A Rickle In Time;Rick;Yes, we're back, problem solved.
2;1;A Rickle In Time;Summer;Yes, we're back to our own time.
2;1;A Rickle In Time;Morty;Yes no more cats, no more cats, oh you did it, you fixed it.
2;1;A Rickle In Time;Testicle Monster A;Yeah, now keep those collars on so you don't break your weak ass time again.
2;1;A Rickle In Time;Rick;How long exactly do we have to wear these things? They're really embarrassing.
2;1;A Rickle In Time;Testicle Monster A;Well since you're goin' to time prison, I'd say you can keep em on forever.
2;1;A Rickle In Time;Summer;Time prison?
2;1;A Rickle In Time;Testicle Monster A;Yeah, well I don't know where you expect me to think you got that crystal over there, but the only way you dumb ass, assin' ass asses could ever have one, is if it was stolen.
2;1;A Rickle In Time;Summer;You stole a time freezing crystal from testical monsters?
2;1;A Rickle In Time;Rick;I would have been happy to pay for it, Summer, but they don't exactly sell them at Costco. Besides, there's a larger lesson to be learned here. Get him!
2;1;A Rickle In Time;Testicle Monster A;Ututututut! You'd better keep back! Man this will turn your ass into a third trimester fetus from 30 yards.
2;1;A Rickle In Time;Vet;Hmm...
2;1;A Rickle In Time;Beth;Isn't there a kitten somewhere that needs a manicure?
2;1;A Rickle In Time;Lawyer;That's right Mrs. Smith, give in to your anger. Neglect that deer.
2;1;A Rickle In Time;Jerry;Honey, it's gonna be okay. These men are from the Cervine Institute of Elk, Moose Deer and Stag. They can take this deer to a helicopter and fly it to the country's top deer surgeon on a wildlife reserve across the state border, where your jurisdiction ends.
2;1;A Rickle In Time;Vet;I guess that's the end of that.
2;1;A Rickle In Time;Lawyer;There is just one more thing. According to this state's veterinarian statute, this animal can't be transferred until the current attending physician verbally confirms their inability to provide adequate care. You heard the man horse doctor, you have to say you couldn't hack it.
2;1;A Rickle In Time;Jerry;We did it...
2;1;A Rickle In Time;Testicle Monster A;Uh-huh, no motha- no, Earth, dude, I'm talking 'bout, yeah, with the dinosaurs. No, if you've get to the dolphin people, you've gone too far. Alright man, I'll talk to you later, okay. You know what they do with 3rd dimensional life forms in time prison? Same thing they do in every other prison, only forever.
2;1;A Rickle In Time;Morty;Why are you doing this?
2;1;A Rickle In Time;Testicle Monster A;You think I wanna be an omniscient immortal being transcending time and space my whole life? I got ambitions man, bringin' you guys in is my ticket up.
2;1;A Rickle In Time;Rick;What if I told you there's a huge ticket up right behind you?
2;1;A Rickle In Time;Testicle Monster A;You really think I'm that stupid?
2;1;A Rickle In Time;Rick;Alright, hear me out on this. You're immortal, right, which means your life is infinite. Well in that case there's 100% chance that you'll eventually do everything, including turning around to look behind you.
2;1;A Rickle In Time;Testicle Monster A;I cannot argue that.
2;1;A Rickle In Time;Rick;Ah, God, gross and weird!
2;1;A Rickle In Time;Testicle Monster A;Chris!
2;1;A Rickle In Time;Testicle Monster A;You killed my gun!
2;1;A Rickle In Time;Rick;Summer, Morty, take off your collars!
2;1;A Rickle In Time;Testicle Monster A;What? What the hell are you doing?
2;1;A Rickle In Time;Rick;Good question. I suppose the answer is: I'm not certain!
2;1;A Rickle In Time;Testicle Monster A;Oh, no, what are you doin'?
2;1;A Rickle In Time;Rick 1;I have no idea!
2;1;A Rickle In Time;Rick 2;I'm not sure.
2;1;A Rickle In Time;All Ricks (off sync);Maybe I will, maybe I won't.
2;1;A Rickle In Time;All Ricks (off sync);I'm really uncertain about everything, even kicking your ass!
2;1;A Rickle In Time;Testicle Monster A;Lis- ay, to, AH. But these arms are vestigial. Now you poked me where an eye would have been about six million years ago.
2;1;A Rickle In Time;All Summers (off sync);Come on, let's help Grampa.
2;1;A Rickle In Time;All Mortys (off sync);Yeah. I'm like a hundred percent not sure about anything.
2;1;A Rickle In Time;Morty 23;Kick his ass, Rick!
2;1;A Rickle In Time;Rick 23;Die, motherfucker!
2;1;A Rickle In Time;Testicle Monster A;Ow, I'm defeated...
2;1;A Rickle In Time;Summer 23;What's happening?
2;1;A Rickle In Time;Rick 23;Time is falling apart, we've got to get back to certainty, quick! Give me your collars!
2;1;A Rickle In Time;Morty 23;Oh man, don't you have to fix, like, thirty of them?
2;1;A Rickle In Time;Rick 23; Morty
2;1;A Rickle In Time;All Ricks (off sync);Oh, shit.
2;1;A Rickle In Time;Jerry;Look, I know I was kind of a nuisance today. I know it's my fault we hit the deer, and I know you wanted to be the one to save it.
2;1;A Rickle In Time;Beth;Whatever. How petty would I have to be to care less about an animal's life than my own ego?
2;1;A Rickle In Time;Jerry;Hmm... you'd have to be pretty petty. But you'd still be the woman I married.
2;1;A Rickle In Time;Beth;Where are we going?
2;1;A Rickle In Time;Jerry;One last stop.
2;1;A Rickle In Time;Beth;Where's the helicopter?
2;1;A Rickle In Time;Jerry;There is no helicopter and there is no Cervine Institute.
2;1;A Rickle In Time;Beth;But the top deer surgeon...
2;1;A Rickle In Time;Jerry;I'm looking at her. Thanks for F.D.'ing me up like that.
2;1;A Rickle In Time;Cold Stone Employee;You'd better get moving, these lights are designed for basic ice cream work, they're not gonna last all night.
2;1;A Rickle In Time;Beth;I need five minutes.
2;1;A Rickle In Time;Beth;Jerry, this was the most romantic weekend I've ever had.
2;1;A Rickle In Time;Jerry;Thanks to Cold Stone Creamery.
2;1;A Rickle In Time;Cold Stone Employee;You're welcome.
2;1;A Rickle In Time;All Ricks;Okay, we're out of time. It's ironic, huh?
2;1;A Rickle In Time;Morty 30;Rick!
2;1;A Rickle In Time;Rick 30;What's goin' on?
2;1;A Rickle In Time;Morty 30;The collar, oh, the latch is broken! It won't latch closed around my neck!
2;1;A Rickle In Time;All Mortys Except Morty 30;What's wrong, how come our collars aren't green?
2;1;A Rickle In Time;All Ricks Except Rick 30;Obviously because someone doesn't know how to put his collar on and one of me is stuck trying to help him.
2;1;A Rickle In Time;All Mortys Except Morty 30;Don't blame this on me, you're the one that couldn't fix a latch!
2;1;A Rickle In Time;Rick 30;What are you talking about, it's not broken, Morty, I fixed it, just put it on!
2;1;A Rickle In Time;Morty 30;It won't close, it's broken!
2;1;A Rickle In Time;Rick 30;Fine, bring it here.
2;1;A Rickle In Time;Morty 30;Ooh, ooh, Rick!
2;1;A Rickle In Time;All Ricks Except Rick 30;Oh, really, Morty? Well I'm sorry, I'm not the one that's so fucking uncertain about everything!
2;1;A Rickle In Time;All Mortys Except Morty 30;You know what I'm certain of, Rick? I've really made up my mind about this, I never wanna see you again!
2;1;A Rickle In Time;All Ricks Except Rick 30;You're never gonna see anything again you little dummy! You killed us!
2;1;A Rickle In Time;Rick 30;Goddammit!
2;1;A Rickle In Time;Morty 30;Ooh
2;1;A Rickle In Time;Rick 30;Morty where's your collar I'll fix it
2;1;A Rickle In Time;Morty 30;I dropped it
2;1;A Rickle In Time;All Ricks Except Rick 30;What the hell? What have you done to me, Morty?
2;1;A Rickle In Time;Rick 30;I'm okay with this. Be good Morty. Be better than me. Holy shit, the other collar! I'm not okay with this! I am not okay with this! Oh, sweet Jesus please let me live. Oh, my God I—I've gotta fix this thing, please God in Heaven, please, God, oh Lord, hear my prayers. Yes! Fuck you God! Not today, bitch.
2;1;A Rickle In Time;All Ricks Except Rick 30;Please, God, if there's a Hell, please be merciful to me.
2;1;A Rickle In Time;Rick 30;Yes I did it! There is no God! In your face. One dot, motherfuckers!
2;1;A Rickle In Time;Morty;Yes, oh, yes, yes!
2;1;A Rickle In Time;Summer;Woohoo! Whoo! Whoo!
2;1;A Rickle In Time;Morty;Oh, that was a close call. Oh yeah, do it Rick, do it right.
2;1;A Rickle In Time;Rick;You know what I'm talking about, oh yeah. I'm gonna do the cabbage patch, Morty. Check me out I'm doing the cabbage patch dance. It's a classic dance, remember, like this. Oh shit look at that.
2;1;A Rickle In Time;Morty;Do the cabbage patch. Do—do—do the dance.
2;1;A Rickle In Time;Summer;Hey wait a second, how come you guys took longer to get here?
2;1;A Rickle In Time;Morty;I don't know. I think like one sixty-fourth of my collars didn't work. It's hard to keep straight now that I have sixty-three other memories of everything.
2;1;A Rickle In Time;Rick;Yeah.
2;1;A Rickle In Time;Morty;But I feel like one of the sixty-four Ricks like, sacrificed himself for me, maybe, I think.
2;1;A Rickle In Time;Rick;Shut up, Morty. The last time you felt something, we all almost died. You little s—piece of shit.
2;1;A Rickle In Time;Beth;Hey guys, we're home.
2;1;A Rickle In Time;Morty & Summer;Mom, Dad!
2;1;A Rickle In Time;Jerry;Um, hold the phone, where did you guys get those necklaces from? Uh, Lady Gaga, table for three, am I right?
2;1;A Rickle In Time;Jerry;Are you guys Power Rangers? But only on one small part of your necks? Hey, do those things need batteries? Were they included? Clean up in the fruit isle! Not in a homophobic way though, they're just fruity necklaces is all I was saying.
2;1;A Rickle In Time;Beth;I'm gonna pee my pants.
2;1;A Rickle In Time;Morty;Doesn't feel so good, does it?
2;1;A Rickle In Time;Rick;No it doesn't. It hurts.
2;1;A Rickle In Time;Beth;I'm gonna pee-hee-hee.
2;1;A Rickle In Time;Jerry;Somebody call the planet of Tron, we have three Tron people over here. But seriously, are these Halloween costumes? Are you going as motorcycles? With green headlights instead of normal ones? Are you dogs? Robot dogs? Gosh, you guys are lame. Are those chokers from the 90's? What is this, a 90's nostalgia thing? Are you guys in that movie “The Craft” with Fairuza Balk?
2;1;A Rickle In Time;Testicle Monster A;Hey man, when the hell were you?
2;1;A Rickle In Time;Testicle Monster B;Looking for you, asshole.
2;1;A Rickle In Time;Testicle Monster A;I told you past the dinosaurs.
2;1;A Rickle In Time;Testicle Monster B;You know how much time is past the dinosaurs? Half of all time!
2;1;A Rickle In Time;Testicle Monster A;Come on, man, it's this way...
2;1;A Rickle In Time;Testicle Monster B;Come on, give me that thing, speed it up, he can't be this far back.
2;1;A Rickle In Time;Testicle Monster A;There he is, there he is, there he is, there he is, stop, stop.
2;1;A Rickle In Time;Testicle Monster B;So that's the guy, huh?
2;1;A Rickle In Time;Testicle Monster A;Yeah, that's him. Hey, man, remember me? I got something for your ass! You don't mess with time! You don't fuck with time, motherfucker!
2;1;A Rickle In Time;Albert Einstein;I vill mess vith time!
2;1;A Rickle In Time;Albert Einstein;I vill mess vith time...
2;2;Mortynight Run;Rick;Learning to fly this thing, Morty, it's gonna be really liberating. Y-Y-You’re gonna be free to go on all kinds of errands for me.
2;2;Mortynight Run;Morty;Cool.
2;2;Mortynight Run;Rick;See that planet right there? Don’t fly too close to that planet. Someone’ll come out and try to wash your windshield.  Hold on.  Yup. Yeah, I have it. Where do you wanna meet? Alright, cool. Alright Morty, lesson’s over. We got some business to attend to a few lightminutes south of here.
2;2;Mortynight Run;Jerry;Oh, you still use ‘south’ in space?
2;2;Mortynight Run;Rick; WHOA! Jesus, Jerry, what the hell are you doing here?!
2;2;Mortynight Run;Jerry;What are you talking about? We agreed a boy’s father should be present when he’s learning to drive.
2;2;Mortynight Run;Rick;I guess I remember that.  Wow. And you’ve just been back there this whole time? Amazing. Well we don’t have time to take him to Earth, Morty. Head for 3124-917.
2;2;Mortynight Run;Jerry;Cool! Looks like I’m comin’ along for an adventure!
2;2;Mortynight Run;Rick;Yep.
2;2;Mortynight Run;Morty;This is where we’re going?
2;2;Mortynight Run;Rick;Nope. This is. You can park in a handicapped spot, Morty. Anything with less than eight limbs is considered disabled here.
2;2;Mortynight Run;Jerry-Sitter;Well look at this fella.  Aren’t you handsome?
2;2;Mortynight Run;Jerry;Thank you! I’m Jerry. 
2;2;Mortynight Run;Jerry-Sitter;Oh, I know you are. Did you come here in a spaceship?
2;2;Mortynight Run;Jerry;I’m travelling with my son and father-in-law. Uh, wait, are they coming?
2;2;Mortynight Run;Jerry-Sitter;Oh, they’ll be back soon.
2;2;Mortynight Run;Jerry;What?
2;2;Mortynight Run;Pajama Jerry;I don’t know how this works!
2;2;Mortynight Run;Underpants Jerry;Help me!
2;2;Mortynight Run;Jerry;What the hell?
2;2;Mortynight Run;Pajama Jerry;I know, right?
2;2;Mortynight Run;Tuxedo Jerry;Oh, what the hell?
2;2;Mortynight Run;Jerry;I know, right?
2;2;Mortynight Run;Morty;Jerryboree? You created a daycare for my dad?
2;2;Mortynight Run;Rick;You kidding? I wish I had this idea. Well… I did have this idea, but I wish I was the version of me that owned it. That guy’s rich.
2;2;Mortynight Run;Receptionist;Don’t forget to check the reason for your drop-off.
2;2;Mortynight Run;Rick; Trust me Morty, I’ve heard stories from other Ricks. Jerrys don’t tend to last five minutes off of Earth. This is a totally unregistered cross-temporal asteroid. Here they can romp and play with other Jerrys. It couldn’t be safer.
2;2;Mortynight Run;Rick;Hey Morty, hang onto this. That number’s your dad. If you lose it, we’re not gonna be able to get him back.
2;2;Mortynight Run;Rick;Okay, wait here.
2;2;Mortynight Run;Morty;I wanna come with.
2;2;Mortynight Run;Rick;Don’t come with. It’s boring, it’s  business stuff.
2;2;Mortynight Run;Morty;What kinda business do you do in a garage? You know, this seems a little shady.
2;2;Mortynight Run;Rick;Right, like nothing shady ever happened in a fully furnished office? You ever hear about Wall Street Morty? Y-You know what those guys do in th—in their fancy board rooms? They take their balls, and they dip ‘em in cocaine, and they wipe ‘em all over each other. You know, Grandpa goes around, and he does his business in public because Grandpa isn’t shady.
2;2;Mortynight Run;Rick;Ah, crap.  Hey, what’s up?
2;2;Mortynight Run;Krombopulos Michael;Hey, Rick! Haha! Here you go, three thousand Flurbos! D’you have the weapon?
2;2;Mortynight Run;Rick;Can… Can we please…? This is my grandson, Morty.
2;2;Mortynight Run;Krombopulos Michael;Well hi Morty! I’m Krombopulos Michael! I’m an assassin. I buy guns from your grandpa.
2;2;Mortynight Run;Rick;Ugh.  Here, now go away.
2;2;Mortynight Run;Krombopulos Michael; Ooh, yeah, this looks deadly. So this shoots antimatter? My target can’t be killed with regular matter. Nice to meet you, Morty! Listen, if you ever need anybody murdered,  please give me a call. I’m very discrete—
2;2;Mortynight Run;Rick;Y-Y-Y-You’re gonna give him your card?!
2;2;Mortynight Run;Krombopulos Michael;I have no code of ethics, I will kill anyone, anywhere! Children, animals, old people, doesn’t matter. I just love killin’!
2;2;Mortynight Run;Morty;…You sell weapons to killers for money?
2;2;Mortynight Run;Rick;Ugh… You’ve got what the intergalactic call a very planetary mindset, Morty. It’s more complicated out here! These are Flurbos. Do you understand what two humans can accomplish with three thousand of these?
2;2;Mortynight Run;Morty;Uh, what?
2;2;Mortynight Run;Rick;An entire afternoon at Blips and Chiiiitz!
2;2;Mortynight Run;Rick;Aw, this place is the best. It’s got beer, games, prizes, and you can never tell what time it is.
2;2;Mortynight Run;Morty;You sold a gun to a murderer so you could play video games?
2;2;Mortynight Run;Rick;Yeah, sure, if you spend all day shuffling words around you can make anything sound bad, Morty.  Here, check this out.
2;2;Mortynight Run;Roy;Ah!
2;2;Mortynight Run;Roy’s mother;Roy, what’s wrong?
2;2;Mortynight Run;Roy;I…had a nightmare. I was with an old man… He put a helmet on me.
2;2;Mortynight Run;Roy’s mother;It’s just a fever. Get some sleep, I don’t want you missing school on Monday. 
2;2;Mortynight Run;Teacher;I want you kids to look around you today and think about your future.  Now is the time in your life when anything is possible.
2;2;Mortynight Run;Announcer;Spiraling perfectly, it’s gonna be caught by Roy Parsons! Roy Parsons is at the 20!  Now he’s at the 10! Nothing can stop Roy the Rocket! Touchdown!
2;2;Mortynight Run;Roy’s wife;I just think it’s time to get realistic. Have you talked to my father about the carpet store? Roy?
2;2;Mortynight Run;Doctor;Had we caught it sooner… Well, hindsight is 20-20, Roy. What’s important is that we move quickly.
2;2;Mortynight Run;Roy;I’m not…ready to die…
2;2;Mortynight Run;Roy’s wife; You’re not going to.
2;2;Mortynight Run;Customer;Hey, thanks for the carpet, Roy.
2;2;Mortynight Run;Voice; Hey Roy, you pull those Persian off-white shags for the clearance sale?
2;2;Mortynight Run;Roy;Whoa. Sh-shit! Shit!
2;2;Mortynight Run;Morty;Whoa! What the hell?! Wha—Where am I?! What the hell?!
2;2;Mortynight Run;Rick;Fifty-five years. Not bad, Morty. You kinda wasted your thirties though with that whole birdwatching phase.
2;2;Mortynight Run;Morty; W… Where’s my wife?
2;2;Mortynight Run;Rick;Morty. You were just playing a game. It’s called Roy. Snap out of it, come on. 
2;2;Mortynight Run;Morty;I’m Morty… You’re Rick… Hey, you sold a gun to a guy that kills people!
2;2;Mortynight Run;Rick;Lookit this. You beat cancer and then you went back to work at the carpet store? Boo.
2;2;Mortynight Run;Morty;Don’t dodge the issue, Rick! Selling a gun to a hitman is the same as pulling the trigger!
2;2;Mortynight Run;Rick;It’s also the same as doing nothing. If Krombopulos Michael wants someone dead, there’s not a lot anybody can do to stop him. That’s why he does it for a living? Now if you’ll excuse me, it’s time to thrash your Roy score. 
2;2;Mortynight Run;Morty;You could stop this killing from happening, Rick! You know, y-you did a bad thing selling that gun, but you could undo it if you wanted!
2;2;Mortynight Run;Rick;Uh-huh, yeah, that’s the difference between you and me, Morty. I never go back to the carpet store.
2;2;Mortynight Run;Alien; Holy shit! This guy’s taking Roy off the grid!  This guy doesn’t have a social security number for Roy!
2;2;Mortynight Run;Jerry;Hi, I’m sorry, I think there was a misunderstanding. I’m an adult and would like to go home, please.
2;2;Mortynight Run;Jerry-Sitter;Well of course! Right through that tube. 
2;2;Mortynight Run;Jerry; Unbelievable. 
2;2;Mortynight Run;Jerry-Sitter;You’re doing great!
2;2;Mortynight Run;Jerry; I know how to crawl in a tube.  Ugh… Come on… This is harder than it looks…  Whoooooaaaa!
2;2;Mortynight Run;Pink-shirt Jerry;Marco?  Marco?
2;2;Mortynight Run;Other Jerry;Come find me.
2;2;Mortynight Run;Pink-shirt Jerry;Marco? 
2;2;Mortynight Run;Jerry;You guys are enjoying this? Don’t you feel a little… patronized?
2;2;Mortynight Run;Pink-shirt Jerry;How so?
2;2;Mortynight Run;Daycare Beth;Jerry!
2;2;Mortynight Run;Other Jerry;Beeeth.
2;2;Mortynight Run;Jerry;Oh, come on, this is ridiculous!
2;2;Mortynight Run;Daycare Beth;I love you, Jerry!
2;2;Mortynight Run;Jerry;Aw… Beth…
2;2;Mortynight Run;Daycare Beth;Who wants to come watch Midnight Run with director’s commentary on?
2;2;Mortynight Run;Jerrys;Oh! Yes! Definitely!
2;2;Mortynight Run;Daycare Beth;First one there gets to adjust the picture settings!
2;2;Mortynight Run;Jerry;The factory tint setting is always too high! 
2;2;Mortynight Run;Other Jerry;Out of my way!
2;2;Mortynight Run;Another Jerry;The factory tint setting is always too high!
2;2;Mortynight Run;Krombopulos Michael;Oh boy, here I go killin’ again!
2;2;Mortynight Run;Ship;You have arrived at Krombopulos Michael. Your destination is below.
2;2;Mortynight Run;Morty; All out of off-white Persians…  Oh man, wha-wh-wh-what have I done?! 
2;2;Mortynight Run;Gromflomite; Drop the gun!
2;2;Mortynight Run;Morty;You don’t understand! This guy was gonna kill someone!
2;2;Mortynight Run;Gromflomite;I guess that makes two of us. 
2;2;Mortynight Run;Rick;What are you doing Morty?! This is a Galactic Federation outpost! Look, I don’t have time to tell you my entire backstory, but Grandpa and government don’t get along!
2;2;Mortynight Run;Fart;You saved my life!
2;2;Mortynight Run;Rick;What?
2;2;Mortynight Run;Morty;Huh?! Are you Krombopulos Michael’s target? W-Wwwwhat’s your name?
2;2;Mortynight Run;Fart;My kind has no use for names. I communicate through what you call “Jessica’s feet.” No, “telepathy.”
2;2;Mortynight Run;Rick;Oh, good job, Morty. Y-Y-Y-You killed my best customer but you saved a mind-reading fart!
2;2;Mortynight Run;Fart;I like this name, ‘Fart.’ Morty, would you kindly release me by pulling that lever to the left of my cell? I am in great pain.
2;2;Mortynight Run;Rick;Morty, don’t do it.  Morty…  Morty, you idiot!
2;2;Mortynight Run;Morty;Oh crap, let’s get you outta here!
2;2;Mortynight Run;Rick;We can’t get him outta here. He’s gaseous. He’s not gonna make it through a portal, Morty.
2;2;Mortynight Run;Morty; Well then I guess we’re all getting in the car! Right, uh…
2;2;Mortynight Run;Fart;Fart.
2;2;Mortynight Run;Morty;No! Jus-j-j-just get in the car!
2;2;Mortynight Run;Rick;Morty, come on, I-I wanna go back to Blips and Chitz. I don’t wanna deal with this!
2;2;Mortynight Run;Morty;Y-You’ve been clear on the fact that you don’t wanna help, so just go away!
2;2;Mortynight Run;Fart;More are coming.
2;2;Mortynight Run;Rick;Screw this. I’m out.
2;2;Mortynight Run;Morty;Oooh…! Come on, come on!
2;2;Mortynight Run;Gromflomite;Get out of the vehicle made of garbage or we will open fire!
2;2;Mortynight Run;Morty; Oh no no no!
2;2;Mortynight Run;Gromflomite;Open fire!
2;2;Mortynight Run;Rick;Stupid-ass fart-saving carpet-store motherfucker!  Move!
2;2;Mortynight Run;Rick;Wait, did you fuck with my seat settings?
2;2;Mortynight Run;Fart;More are coming.
2;2;Mortynight Run;Morty;Rick!
2;2;Mortynight Run;Rick;Yeah, yeah. 
2;2;Mortynight Run;Gearhead;Your geldon convertor is pretty dinged up.
2;2;Mortynight Run;Rick;That’s ‘cause my grandson drives like a male Obavradian. Yeah, I said it. Some stereotypes are based in fact.
2;2;Mortynight Run;Gearhead;Actually, it’s because of years of neglect. You really need to respect your gears, Rick. To you, they’re just wheels with teeth, but in my culture, wars have been fought, entire—
2;2;Mortynight Run;Rick; So I’ve heard. Just fix it.  I don’t think the Gromflomites can track us now, but it looks like we’re gonna be here for awhile.  Or, ya know, if you still have that gun K. Michael dropped, we can finish the job and go home.
2;2;Mortynight Run;Fart;You do understand I’m telepathic, right?
2;2;Mortynight Run;Rick;I’m being polite.
2;2;Mortynight Run;Morty;Rick, we’re taking him back where he belongs!
2;2;Mortynight Run;Rick;Yeah, where’s that? Are you going on a quest to find he who smelt it?
2;2;Mortynight Run;Fart;I came here accidentally through a wormhole located in what you call “get out of my head, Fart, I know you’re in here, la la la la—” No, in what you call the Promethean Nebula.
2;2;Mortynight Run;Rick;Oh great, just a hop, skip, and an 800 lightyear jump!
2;2;Mortynight Run;Morty;You know, you can leave any time you want, Rick.
2;2;Mortynight Run;Rick; Whatever you wanna do you little punk-ass little bitch…
2;2;Mortynight Run;Fart;Thank you, Morty. You are not like other carbon-based life forms. You put the value of all life above your own.
2;2;Mortynight Run;Morty;That’s how things should be. It’s how they could be.
2;2;Mortynight Run;Fart;I could not agree more.
2;2;Mortynight Run;Fart; The world can be one together / Cosmos without hatred / Stars like diamonds in your eyes. / The ground can be space  / With feet marching toward a peaceful sky. / All the moonmen want things their way / But we make sure they see the sun. / Goodbye, moonmen / You say goodbye, moonmen. / Goodby—
2;2;Mortynight Run;Rick; Shut the fuck up about moonmen! This isn’t a musical number. This is a fucking operation, we gotta be cool and fucking lay low!
2;2;Mortynight Run;Random Jerry; Duck, duck, birdie?  Very funny!
2;2;Mortynight Run;Jerry;Here comes another funny…
2;2;Mortynight Run;Other Jerry;Hahaha! Oh, this place is great.
2;2;Mortynight Run;Jerry;I almost wish I could stay longer than one day.
2;2;Mortynight Run;Other Jerry; You just might.
2;2;Mortynight Run;Jerry;W-What do you mean?
2;2;Mortynight Run;Other Jerry;These are the Jerrys whose Ricks and Mortys never came back.  …They live here now.
2;2;Mortynight Run;Jerry;Uuuum…
2;2;Mortynight Run;Gear Anchor;No gear turnings as of yet in the curious case of these unidentified humanoid fugitives  reportedly at large somewhere within the Gear System.
2;2;Mortynight Run;Rick;Son of a…  Why were the Gromflomites holding you prisoner? What the fuck is so valuable about you?
2;2;Mortynight Run;Fart;I am no more valuable than life itself. However, I am able to alter the composition of atoms, like this.  That was oxygen. I added seventy-one protons to it.
2;2;Mortynight Run;Rick; Ah, terrific. The fart that pooped gold. No wonder every cop in the system is lookin’ for us!  Any species that gets a hold of this thing is gonna use it to take over the galaxy. Do you know how inconvenient that’s gonna be to my work?
2;2;Mortynight Run;Rick;Somebody dropped the dime on us. Gearhead… 
2;2;Mortynight Run;Gearhead; I’m sorry, Rick. The reward on your head is too high. And like you always say, you gotta look out for Number One.
2;2;Mortynight Run;Rick;Number One is me, asshole! You’re supposed to be my friend!
2;2;Mortynight Run;Gearhead;Friend? Do you even know my real name? It’s Revolio Clockberg Junior. I belong to an entire species of gear people. Calling me ‘Gearhead’ is like calling a Chinese person ‘Asia-face.’
2;2;Mortynight Run;Gearhead;No, not twigs!
2;2;Mortynight Run;Rick;Two things I wanna make clear to everybody in this room. Never betray me, and it’s time to go.
2;2;Mortynight Run;Gear Policeman #1;Nobody move!
2;2;Mortynight Run;Gear Policeman #2;Oh my god.
2;2;Mortynight Run;Gear Policeman #1;Are those…?
2;2;Mortynight Run;Rick;Hey Morty, remember when you said selling a gun was as bad as pulling the trigger? How do you feel about all these people getting killed because of your choices?
2;2;Mortynight Run;Morty;I did the right thing, Rick!
2;2;Mortynight Run;Rick;Tell that to Gearhead’s gearsticles.
2;2;Mortynight Run;Morty;You did that!
2;2;Mortynight Run;Rick;Wrong! I’d be playin’ Roy right now. At a certain point, my hands are tied, Morty.
2;2;Mortynight Run;Jerry; I can’t believe Rick did this. This is the eighth to the last straw.
2;2;Mortynight Run;Bearded Jerry;Ante up.
2;2;Mortynight Run;Jerry;You know what?  Screw it! I have a better gamble for your guys.  I say we escape.
2;2;Mortynight Run;Bearded Jerry;If you want to leave, you can just go out the front door.
2;2;Mortynight Run;Tank-top Jerry;You think we’re kept here against our will? That would be illegal.
2;2;Mortynight Run;Jerry;But… If you can leave, then why are you still here?
2;2;Mortynight Run;Buzzcut Jerry;Same reason as you.  …We’re Jerrys.
2;2;Mortynight Run;Jerry;I’m leaving.
2;2;Mortynight Run;Jerry-Sitter;Okay then, that was always allowed.
2;2;Mortynight Run;Rick;Morty, take the wheel!
2;2;Mortynight Run;Morty;Whoa, whoa!
2;2;Mortynight Run;Rick;Whoa!
2;2;Mortynight Run;Rick;Geez, dammit, Morty! Who taught you to fly this thing?!  Haha, I’m kidding, I know that’s on me.
2;2;Mortynight Run;Morty;Um, Rick!
2;2;Mortynight Run;Rick;Shit. Well, I guess this is it.
2;2;Mortynight Run;Fart;Morty, crack the window.
2;2;Mortynight Run;Fart;I wonder why Greg is always so critical of my girlfriend.
2;2;Mortynight Run;Officer;Well… He’d probably like to have me to himself, that’s how friends are.
2;2;Mortynight Run;Fart;Or does he want her to himself?
2;2;Mortynight Run;Fart;The world can be one together / Cosmos without hatred / Stars like diamonds in your eyes.
2;2;Mortynight Run;Officer; My life is a fucking joke.
2;2;Mortynight Run;Fart;Goodbye, moonmen. / You say, goodbye, moonmen.
2;2;Mortynight Run;Fart;Goodbye, moonmen…  Alright, let’s proceed.
2;2;Mortynight Run;Rick;Damn. Can’t blame that on the dog. …Talk about silent but deadly. I-I’ve seen some nerve gas but ga- th-this gas got some nerve! Haha, you know what I’m sayin’?
2;2;Mortynight Run;Morty; Are you done?
2;2;Mortynight Run;Rick;I’ll let you know, Morty. Gone with the wind, am I right? If you don’t like that one, Morty, an alt on that one could be, like…if I said Gasablanca! …Alright, I’m done.  Let’s get to the Promethean Nebula, so my grandson can finish savin’ a life!
2;2;Mortynight Run;Garblovian;Ga-ga blahg blahg?
2;2;Mortynight Run;Jerry;Um… Earth, please?
2;2;Mortynight Run;Jerry;Um… Is this… Do I pay?
2;2;Mortynight Run;Garblovian;Agah blahg-blah! 
2;2;Mortynight Run;Jerry;Sorry!
2;2;Mortynight Run;Jerry;Hmm. Hmm…  Agh! 
2;2;Mortynight Run;Garblovian;Agah blahg blahg?
2;2;Mortynight Run;Jerry;I don’t…
2;2;Mortynight Run;Garblovian; Agah blahg!
2;2;Mortynight Run;Jerry;What do you want?
2;2;Mortynight Run;Garblovian; Agah blahg blah—
2;2;Mortynight Run;Jerry;Oh!  Ahahaaaahhhhh….
2;2;Mortynight Run;Jerry; Uhhh… Huhhh….  Oooh! 
2;2;Mortynight Run;Tank-top Jerry;Hey, are you the one that left?
2;2;Mortynight Run;Jerry;
2;2;Mortynight Run;Tank-top Jerry;I get it. It’s… uh… a hassle out there.
2;2;Mortynight Run;Jerry; Right? Who needs that?
2;2;Mortynight Run;Other Jerrys; Right? Not me.
2;2;Mortynight Run;Paul;Oh-ho, not us!
2;2;Mortynight Run;Jerry;Uh… Who are you?
2;2;Mortynight Run;Paul;Oh, excuse me. Paul Fleishman.  Infinite timelines! In some of them Beth remarries.
2;2;Mortynight Run;Jerry;…Geez…
2;2;Mortynight Run;Paul;Don’t worry. I treat Beth very well, and I do not overstep my bounds with Morty. Every kid needs a dad, but there’s no replacing you. Hey, you wanna give us a hand with this?  We’re trying to figure out how to get the sound coming through the stereo instead of the TV. I-I-I don’t—It’s very difficult.
2;2;Mortynight Run;Jerry;Oh. Uh, well, is there an Aux input?
2;2;Mortynight Run;Tank-top Jerry;I tried that, but there’s two different colors.
2;2;Mortynight Run;Various Jerrys;Uh… There’s two different colors.
2;2;Mortynight Run;Fart;The wormhole is seventy of what you call ‘meters’ what you call ‘north’ of what you call ‘here.’
2;2;Mortynight Run;Rick;Fine. Morty, take your fart to his hole and say your goodbyes. I’m gonna find some fuel and take a biiiig fat Morty.  That’s my new word for ‘shit’ because of today’s events.
2;2;Mortynight Run;Fart;Here it is. This should take me back to my kind.
2;2;Mortynight Run;Morty;I’m gonna miss you, um, Fart. I’m really sorry your name became Fart.
2;2;Mortynight Run;Fart;I will be back soon, Morty.
2;2;Mortynight Run;Morty; Really?
2;2;Mortynight Run;Fart;After I return to the others with this location, we will be back for your cleansing.
2;2;Mortynight Run;Morty;Um… Cleansing…?
2;2;Mortynight Run;Fart;Carbon-based life is a threat to all higher life. To us, you are what you would call a disease. Wherever we discover you, we cure it. You said yourself that life must be protected even through sacrifice.  You haven’t changed your mind about that. I can sense your thoughts. Morty.
2;2;Mortynight Run;Morty; Um… Before you go… Could you sing a… C-Could you sing for me again?
2;2;Mortynight Run;Fart;Yes, Morty.  Cosmos without hatred / Blinding stars of cosmic light / Quasars shine through endless night / And everything is one in the beauty / And now we say goodby—
2;2;Mortynight Run;Fart;Morty… Why… Why?
2;2;Mortynight Run;Morty;Goodbye.
2;2;Mortynight Run;Rick;So did you guys make out a little bit? Is he gonna send you a postcard?  Man, that guy hit the lottery when he crossed paths with you.
2;2;Mortynight Run;Rick;Morty, I know I picked on your core beliefs and decision making a lot today, but I am glad you insisted on gettin’ that fart home. You know, at least all the death and destruction wasn’t for nothin’, you know?  You miss your fart friend, huh? Well I’ve got a little surprise for you, buddy. While you were gone I found another wormhole with millions of beings just like him on the other side and they’re all coming to visit.
2;2;Mortynight Run;Morty; What?! Rick! No, you can’t!
2;2;Mortynight Run;Rick;Too late, Morty. The hole’s opening.
2;2;Mortynight Run;Morty;No, no, Rick! You don’t understand!
2;2;Mortynight Run;Rick;Th-there’s a lot more where that came from too.
2;2;Mortynight Run;Rick;Hey.  Hey bro. How many people was your Morty responsible for killing today?
2;2;Mortynight Run;Other Rick;None, we chilled at Blips and Chitz all day, ain’t that right homie?
2;2;Mortynight Run;Other Morty;Darn right bro! Roy rules!
2;2;Mortynight Run;Other Rick;Haha!
2;2;Mortynight Run;Rick; Must be nice… Hey, Morty, there’s our Jerry.
2;2;Mortynight Run;Jerry;Mm, I missed you. Hey, Rick.
2;2;Mortynight Run;Rick;Glad you’re safe Jerry. What do you say we go home?
2;2;Mortynight Run;Jerry;I’d like that.
2;2;Mortynight Run;Another Rick; Hey, wait, do you have 5126?
2;2;Mortynight Run;Rick;Uh, I’m not sure. Morty.
2;2;Mortynight Run;Other Rick;Uh, that’s a Blips and Chitz ticket.
2;2;Mortynight Run;Morty;What?!
2;2;Mortynight Run;Rick;Way to go, Morty. Eh, whatever.
2;2;Mortynight Run;Jerrys;Uh… W-wait, what?
2;2;Mortynight Run;Ricks;Alright, come on, Jerry.
2;2;Mortynight Run;Announcer;Are you tired of the same daily droll? Well, get on over to Blips and Chitz!  We got, uh… one game! We got a whole bunch of games here! Uh, we got chabos and flobos and you can shoot things! Get on over here and play the games! Use your Flurbos to get tickets! Roy 2 just got here! G-Get over here at Ch… Chips and Chitz!
2;2;Mortynight Run;Rick;It’s the coolest place in the world! Hahahaha, I g- I get to be in a commercial!
2;3;Auto Erotic Assimilation;All;Love. Connection. Experience.
2;3;Auto Erotic Assimilation;Rick;Yeah Morty
2;3;Auto Erotic Assimilation;All;Come together. With love. connection, experience! 
2;3;Auto Erotic Assimilation;Rick;It's my favourite song.
2;3;Auto Erotic Assimilation;Morty;Hahahahaha, yeah.
2;3;Auto Erotic Assimilation;Rick;Oh yeah, distress beacon!  Yeah baby!
2;3;Auto Erotic Assimilation;Morty;You're excited about that?
2;3;Auto Erotic Assimilation;Rick;"The first rule of space travel kids, is always check out distress beacons; nine out of ten times its a ship full of dead aliens and a bunch of free shit!"
2;3;Auto Erotic Assimilation;Morty;Whoa!
2;3;Auto Erotic Assimilation;Summer;Whoa!
2;3;Auto Erotic Assimilation;Rick;One out of ten times its a deadly trap, but I'm ready to roll those dice!
2;3;Auto Erotic Assimilation;Summer;Seems like something terrible happened here.
2;3;Auto Erotic Assimilation;Rick;Yeah. Cha-ching. Oh yeah, if you find a room full of eggs, don't shy away from it, give one of them a shake. Those facehuggers are worth more than this ship.
2;3;Auto Erotic Assimilation;Morty;Uh, what's that?
2;3;Auto Erotic Assimilation;Rick;This will make the cops write it up as a looting by the Korblocks.
2;3;Auto Erotic Assimilation;Summer;That's horrible!
2;3;Auto Erotic Assimilation;Rick;I hear you man, cops are racist.
2;3;Auto Erotic Assimilation;Rick;Oh, hey! You're alive! Thank God.
2;3;Auto Erotic Assimilation;Female alien;Can you help us? Our planet was taken over by some kind of  entity! It absorbed the minds of our people!
2;3;Auto Erotic Assimilation;Male alien 1;"We didn't notice until it was too late. The people it takes over, they look like your friends, your family, your leaders, but they're not, themselves any more; They're part of It."
2;3;Auto Erotic Assimilation;Rick;And how do you know it didn't get on the ship with you? Those two ding-dongs seem pretty calm about the whole thing.
2;3;Auto Erotic Assimilation;Male alien with glasses;Hey! No, no- uurgh!
2;3;Auto Erotic Assimilation;Rick;Called it.
2;3;Auto Erotic Assimilation;All six aliens together;Hello Rick. Long time no see.
2;3;Auto Erotic Assimilation;Rick;Unity!?
2;3;Auto Erotic Assimilation;Morty;Rick?
2;3;Auto Erotic Assimilation;Summer;Grandpa?
2;3;Auto Erotic Assimilation;Rick;Oh boy. Uh, these are my grandkids, Summer and Morty. Summer, Morty, this is uh, Unity. We sort of used to, uh, date.
2;3;Auto Erotic Assimilation;Rick;Quite an operation you got going here Une. You're a whole planet now huh?
2;3;Auto Erotic Assimilation;Unity;After we broke up, I spend some time wandering through space,
2;3;Auto Erotic Assimilation;Unity;then I found this world,
2;3;Auto Erotic Assimilation;Unity;where I was better able to focus on my passion for unification.
2;3;Auto Erotic Assimilation;Summer;You mean stealing peoples’ bodies?
2;3;Auto Erotic Assimilation;Rick;Summer, rude. Why don't you kids run off and play with Unity while Unity and I do some catching up.
2;3;Auto Erotic Assimilation;Summer;Ugh.
2;3;Auto Erotic Assimilation;Morty;Wait! Rick, aren't these people going to barf into our mouths and absorb us?
2;3;Auto Erotic Assimilation;Unity;"You're guests here on my planet, you're free to be yourselves; I've never been good at disappointing Rick."
2;3;Auto Erotic Assimilation;Summer;Well now I'm going to barf. Come on Morty.
2;3;Auto Erotic Assimilation;Beth;Jerry, what are you- what are you doing in here?
2;3;Auto Erotic Assimilation;Jerry;I'm trying to find our weed whacker, ‘cause our weeds are wack, yo.
2;3;Auto Erotic Assimilation;Beth;But you can't go in the garage when Rick's not here.
2;3;Auto Erotic Assimilation;Jerry;I can't?
2;3;Auto Erotic Assimilation;Beth;Well, he doesn't like it.
2;3;Auto Erotic Assimilation;Jerry;What's he gonna do, crash rent-free at his other family's house?
2;3;Auto Erotic Assimilation;Beth;What is that supposed to mean?
2;3;Auto Erotic Assimilation;Jerry;Your dad gets to walk all over us because of your abandonment issues! He's playing you, shorty.
2;3;Auto Erotic Assimilation;Beth;Oh, stop affecting that stupid hip-hop dialect!
2;3;Auto Erotic Assimilation;Jerry;Stop shifting the crosshairs to my ironic urban patois just because your relationship with your father is toe-up from the flow-up.
2;3;Auto Erotic Assimilation;Jerry;What the hell was that?
2;3;Auto Erotic Assimilation;Beth; I don't know, let's just leave!
2;3;Auto Erotic Assimilation;Jerry;That is a hatch! Your father put a hatch in my garage!
2;3;Auto Erotic Assimilation;Beth;You don't know it was him!  Anyway, we’re not supposed to be in here!
2;3;Auto Erotic Assimilation;Jerry;Obviously, neither is whatever's gurgling down there.
2;3;Auto Erotic Assimilation;Rick;World peace achieved. Nice! A little weird to publish a paper about it for yourself, but hey. So what's next?
2;3;Auto Erotic Assimilation;Unity;After I become a type-one civilisation, this world will be invited into the Galactic Federation.
2;3;Auto Erotic Assimilation;Rick;Oh, goody.
2;3;Auto Erotic Assimilation;Unity;From there I'll have access to countless planets and species.
2;3;Auto Erotic Assimilation;Unity;One by one, I will unify them, I will become the universe, and I will be what the single-minded once called a god.
2;3;Auto Erotic Assimilation;Rick; I like that. Oh, that's pretty sexy. Hey listen, where can I get a drink around here?
2;3;Auto Erotic Assimilation;Unity;Recreational substances were phased out here. There's no need for escape from the self when your world is one.
2;3;Auto Erotic Assimilation;Rick;Unity, Unity, who am I talking to? I watched you assimilate a whole police station just to get your hands on the evidence locker.
2;3;Auto Erotic Assimilation;Unity;Rick, when we met I was a young hivemind with the population of a small town. People... change.
2;3;Auto Erotic Assimilation;Unity;Especially when I change them. I'm sorry to disappoint you, but... I’ve grown.
2;3;Auto Erotic Assimilation;Rick;Hey, listen, I’ve grown too. I have! See, I’ve- I’ve reconnected with my family, right?
2;3;Auto Erotic Assimilation;Unity;Hm, why is that I wonder?
2;3;Auto Erotic Assimilation;Rick;Maybe it's part of getting old. Maybe I just miss being with... a collective.
2;3;Auto Erotic Assimilation;Unity;Yes Rick! Yes! Yes!
2;3;Auto Erotic Assimilation;Rick;Oh yeah!
2;3;Auto Erotic Assimilation;Unity;Yes! Yes!
2;3;Auto Erotic Assimilation;Rick;Wait, wait, stop! H-Hold it! Not like this. We need a hang glider. And a crotchless Uncle Sam costume. And I want the entire field of your largest stadium covered end to end with naked redheads! And I want the stands packed with every man that remotely resembles my father!
2;3;Auto Erotic Assimilation;Morty;Look at ‘em go! So coordinated! What’s your problem? They’re making you into a Mount Rushmore! They made burgers!
2;3;Auto Erotic Assimilation;Summer;Morty, open your eyes! There is no they! These poor people's’ bodies are being used! They're a planet of puppets!
2;3;Auto Erotic Assimilation;Unity;I can hear you.
2;3;Auto Erotic Assimilation;Summer;Ugh!
2;3;Auto Erotic Assimilation;Morty;Well, seems like everybody here's cool with it. Except for all those redheads. They seem like they're in a hurry to be somewhere else.
2;3;Auto Erotic Assimilation;Unity;Balloon, Summer? Balloon, Morty?
2;3;Auto Erotic Assimilation;Summer;No, we don't want your dumb balloons. We’re bored. Take us back to Rick.
2;3;Auto Erotic Assimilation;Unity;Now's... not a good time.
2;3;Auto Erotic Assimilation;Rick;Oh yeah! I want youuuuuu!
2;3;Auto Erotic Assimilation;Unity;Go son go! Go son go! Go son go!
2;3;Auto Erotic Assimilation;Jerry;Oh! Real nice! Real nice! How does a man do this without me noticing?
2;3;Auto Erotic Assimilation;Beth;Oh, you know my dad. Once he puts his mind to something...
2;3;Auto Erotic Assimilation;Jerry;You're spinning this to his credit?
2;3;Auto Erotic Assimilation;Jerry;I'm going down there.
2;3;Auto Erotic Assimilation;Beth;Jerry!
2;3;Auto Erotic Assimilation;Jerry;Beth, this is my house, which makes this my garage, my secret hatch, my hidden subterranean lair,  and my faceless gargler. Now, are you going to keep hating this playa, or are you gonna jack my steed?
2;3;Auto Erotic Assimilation;Beth;Okay, you're just making stuff up now.
2;3;Auto Erotic Assimilation;Rick;Oh my god. Oh my god. 
2;3;Auto Erotic Assimilation;Unity;Oh Rick, it was so bad.
2;3;Auto Erotic Assimilation;Rick;What's this ‘was’ stuff? I just need to hydrate and then we’re doing that again!
2;3;Auto Erotic Assimilation;Unity;Oh damn.
2;3;Auto Erotic Assimilation;Rick;Listen, if this is an invasion I gotta sit this one out, but I'll- I'll be back to have sex with the survivors.
2;3;Auto Erotic Assimilation;Unity;It's a neighboring hivemind species, Beta-7. Our planet's maintained a practical alliance for exchange of vital resources.  So be nice!
2;3;Auto Erotic Assimilation;Beta-7;Unity.  Is it a... bad time? Are all... present lifeforms... assimilated?
2;3;Auto Erotic Assimilation;Unity;Beta-7, this is my single-minded friend from Earth, Rick.
2;3;Auto Erotic Assimilation;Beta-7;Rick... Sanchez. Unity has spoken of you.
2;3;Auto Erotic Assimilation;Rick;All bad I hope. 
2;3;Auto Erotic Assimilation;Rick;Whoa, Jesus Christ!
2;3;Auto Erotic Assimilation;Unity;Beta-7, if my allies are a problem for you perhaps our alliance is as well.
2;3;Auto Erotic Assimilation;Beta-7;Our alliance is beneficial. When Beta-7 expresses concern it- it's only ... be-because...
2;3;Auto Erotic Assimilation;Rick;Oh snap! Powdered neutronium? Amphetetron? You know what I can make with this stuff?
2;3;Auto Erotic Assimilation;Unity;Oh... Rick, I- I shouldn't...
2;3;Auto Erotic Assimilation;Rick;Come on, it's not every day that I'm in town! It- it's for old time's sake.
2;3;Auto Erotic Assimilation;Unity;Uh... Okay, what the hell! We can purify the resin and make fractal dust!
2;3;Auto Erotic Assimilation;Rick;Oh, I was thinking velocitinis, but...
2;3;Auto Erotic Assimilation;Unity;Aww, old man Rick can't party with the whole planet?
2;3;Auto Erotic Assimilation;Rick;I can do whatever you do and more, baby.
2;3;Auto Erotic Assimilation;Beta-7;Hrmm...
2;3;Auto Erotic Assimilation;Rick;You know, I think Beta-7 over there is hoping your alliance can be more than practical.
2;3;Auto Erotic Assimilation;Jerry;Well, this explains the six thousand dollar electric bill.
2;3;Auto Erotic Assimilation;Blim Blam;
2;3;Auto Erotic Assimilation;Jerry;Well. Nice. Real nice. Alien prisoners under the house. Real nice. Nice. Reeeal-
2;3;Auto Erotic Assimilation;Beth;Goddamn it, stop.
2;3;Auto Erotic Assimilation;Summer;Wake up people! You have to fight it! You're under the spell of an evil monster!
2;3;Auto Erotic Assimilation;Unity;I can hear you.
2;3;Auto Erotic Assimilation;Summer;Yeah! So you keep saying!
2;3;Auto Erotic Assimilation;Morty;Summer!
2;3;Auto Erotic Assimilation;Summer;Wake up! You have to have some individuality left in there!
2;3;Auto Erotic Assimilation;Unity;Why do you hate me, Summer?
2;3;Auto Erotic Assimilation;Summer;I'm not talking to you! I'm talking to...
2;3;Auto Erotic Assimilation;Summer;...Steven Phillips! Steven! Set yourself free!
2;3;Auto Erotic Assimilation;Unity;Summer, before I took over this planet, this man was a registered sex offender.
2;3;Auto Erotic Assimilation;Summer;...Yeah, well so what? At least he was himself.
2;3;Auto Erotic Assimilation;Unity;This woman was a drug addict on the verge of suicide. Now she's a marine biologist.
2;3;Auto Erotic Assimilation;Morty;Listen Unity, I don't think my sister's trying to say that life would be perfect without you. I think she's just saying that life would be... you know, life.
2;3;Auto Erotic Assimilation;Unity;I have transformed life here into a paradise. Prostitutes are now scientists. The homeless are now phisosophers.
2;3;Auto Erotic Assimilation;Summer;Oh, phi- phisosophers?
2;3;Auto Erotic Assimilation;Unity;Philophiluh... phiphophibup...
2;3;Auto Erotic Assimilation;Summer;Oh my god. Where did you learn to talk you grandpa-stealing slut?
2;3;Auto Erotic Assimilation;Unity;I'm feeling... urk!
2;3;Auto Erotic Assimilation;Morty;Oh man! Let me help all of you guys up!
2;3;Auto Erotic Assimilation;Unity;I'm fine!
2;3;Auto Erotic Assimilation;Unity;Do you know what I love about you, Rick? You're the only single mind I’ve met who really sees the big picture.
2;3;Auto Erotic Assimilation;Rick;You got that right. But... baby, listen. Y-you're talking about taking over planets and galaxies, you gotta... you gotta just... remember to let go sometimes, you know.
2;3;Auto Erotic Assimilation;Unity;I can let go! Hey, look! You see that town across the river? Watch this.
2;3;Auto Erotic Assimilation;Rick;Whoa!
2;3;Auto Erotic Assimilation;Unity;Ha ha! Woot!
2;3;Auto Erotic Assimilation;Rick;Whoa! That's not what I meant!
2;3;Auto Erotic Assimilation;Unity; It's okay! It's okay, I evacuated! I evacuated the town, look!
2;3;Auto Erotic Assimilation;Unity;Hey! Right here! We’re fine!
2;3;Auto Erotic Assimilation;Rick; Oh, that was awesome! My grandkids weren't in that town, right? A-are my grandkids alive? ... H-hey, my drink is empty.
2;3;Auto Erotic Assimilation;Morty and Summer;Aah!
2;3;Auto Erotic Assimilation;Summer;Unity, what's happening?
2;3;Auto Erotic Assimilation;Steven Phillips;Who's Unity? You kids have nice feet. Mind if I take a picture?
2;3;Auto Erotic Assimilation;Summer;Gross, no!
2;3;Auto Erotic Assimilation;Morty;I think you're getting what you wanted, Summer. Something's happening to Unity.
2;3;Auto Erotic Assimilation;Summer;Do... all of you remember who you are?
2;3;Auto Erotic Assimilation;Ron Benson;...Yeah. My name is Ron Benson. I'm... an electrical engineer. Father of two, and as you can see from my flat concentric nipple rings, I'm a member of this planet's top race! 
2;3;Auto Erotic Assimilation;Summer;Okay, that's good! Uh... Don't focus too much on the last part, but...
2;3;Auto Erotic Assimilation;Daryl Jefferson;I'm Daryll Jefferson. I'm a landscaper. And I'll be damned if that ripple-nipple bitch's race is superior!  The cone-nipple people will rule this world!
2;3;Auto Erotic Assimilation;Ron Benson;You shut your mouth, you dirty knife-nipple bastards!
2;3;Auto Erotic Assimilation;Daryl Jefferson;What'd you say to me, you target-chested piece of shit?
2;3;Auto Erotic Assimilation;Alien man;Race war!
2;3;Auto Erotic Assimilation;Summer;Why are you fighting? Can't you see you're all the same?
2;3;Auto Erotic Assimilation;Morty;Ah, Summer. Ha ha. First race war, huh?
2;3;Auto Erotic Assimilation;Morty;Way to go, Summer. You started a race war.
2;3;Auto Erotic Assimilation;Summer;I didn't start it! They're the racists! I... I  merely empowered them to follow their apparently misguided dreams!
2;3;Auto Erotic Assimilation;Morty;Okay, thanks for clarifying! Y- I'll have a super accurate headstone now!
2;3;Auto Erotic Assimilation;Rioter;Hey wait, what race are you guys?
2;3;Auto Erotic Assimilation;Morty;We’re neither! S-see?
2;3;Auto Erotic Assimilation;Summer;Yeah, take my word for it. We just have regular nipples.
2;3;Auto Erotic Assimilation;Rioter;Hey! These two freaks have no race!
2;3;Auto Erotic Assimilation;Morty;Oh, there's no place like home! There's no place like home! Remember, Summer?
2;3;Auto Erotic Assimilation;Summer;Oh...
2;3;Auto Erotic Assimilation;Morty;From Dorothy and The Tiny People movie?
2;3;Auto Erotic Assimilation;Summer;O-oh, yes, yes yes...
2;3;Auto Erotic Assimilation;Morty;All the tiny people?
2;3;Auto Erotic Assimilation;Summer;Dorothy, take us away! Take us away!
2;3;Auto Erotic Assimilation;Unity;Hello Summer. Hello Morty.
2;3;Auto Erotic Assimilation;Unity;It's okay! You're safe now.
2;3;Auto Erotic Assimilation;Morty;U-Unity?
2;3;Auto Erotic Assimilation;Unity;Yes.
2;3;Auto Erotic Assimilation;Summer;Oh, Unity I am so sorry. I didn't know freedom meant people doing stuff that sucks! I was thinking more of... a choose-your-own-cellphone-carrier thing.
2;3;Auto Erotic Assimilation;Unity;Oh, Summer, you did nothing wrong! I'm having fun with your grandpa! Lost a little control. Probably shouldn't be piloting a hovercopter, nor should I be... running two hundred thousand pediatric hospitals and twelve million deep friers, but hey! It's not like this planet can take its business elsewhere!
2;3;Auto Erotic Assimilation;Morty;Um... should we maybe stop somewhere and get you a coffee? Maybe splash a little water on your face, or...?
2;3;Auto Erotic Assimilation;Unity;No, no, if I wanted to be sober, I wouldn't have gotten drunk! Wooohoooo!
2;3;Auto Erotic Assimilation;Jerry;Oh man. I cannot wait. I cannot wait to hear Rick explain his way around this. He is gone!
2;3;Auto Erotic Assimilation;Beth;Jerry, stop! Please, okay, we weren't even supposed to be down here. If we confront him about this-
2;3;Auto Erotic Assimilation;Jerry;Oh my god! I love this! I love that this is how far you will go for him. You wanna go upstairs, and cut carrots, and watch a Lifetime original, above a fucking alien dungeon! Your relationship with your father is psychotic!
2;3;Auto Erotic Assimilation;Beth;Oh listen to you relish the idea that my genius father is a bad person! Step out of your ego for a second and look at this thing! It's a monster! He might have it chained up so that it doesn't eat the planet!
2;3;Auto Erotic Assimilation;Jerry;Right, because your father's such an altruist? I once saw him briefly forget the word for humans! He's probably harvesting this creature's organs!
2;3;Auto Erotic Assimilation;Beth;He's probably racing to cure its space aids!
2;3;Auto Erotic Assimilation;Jerry;He's going to eat it!
2;3;Auto Erotic Assimilation;Beth;He's protecting it!
2;3;Auto Erotic Assimilation;Both;Shut up!
2;3;Auto Erotic Assimilation;Summer;Unity! This place is a mess!
2;3;Auto Erotic Assimilation;Unity;Oh, it's cool! The part of me that's the cleaning lady is coming on Friday.  Oh my god! I have a meeting at the galactic federation in an hour. Oh, I'll never make it! Ah, I'll push it to next week.
2;3;Auto Erotic Assimilation;Morty;Unity, could you get Rick out here please?
2;3;Auto Erotic Assimilation;Unity;He's... unavailable! He's-
2;3;Auto Erotic Assimilation;Summer;Having sex with you, we get it! Gross. Get him out here now.
2;3;Auto Erotic Assimilation;Unity;I don't think he wants to be-
2;3;Auto Erotic Assimilation;Summer; Grandpa Rick!
2;3;Auto Erotic Assimilation;Morty; Rick! Rick!
2;3;Auto Erotic Assimilation;Summer; I'm gonna tell mom and dad about the gagoo you have locked up under the garage!
2;3;Auto Erotic Assimilation;Rick;What the hell... is your problem?
2;3;Auto Erotic Assimilation;Summer;Grandpa, we need to go home! Now!
2;3;Auto Erotic Assimilation;Rick;Fine, geez!
2;3;Auto Erotic Assimilation;Rick;See ya!
2;3;Auto Erotic Assimilation;Morty;Uh, Rick? I think we should all go.
2;3;Auto Erotic Assimilation;Rick;Tend your garden, kids, I'm kinda doing a thing here.
2;3;Auto Erotic Assimilation;Summer;Grandpa Rick, we’re not leaving without you!
2;3;Auto Erotic Assimilation;Rick;Oh my god  you guys I get it. You're afraid the big bad hivemind is gonna steal  your grandpa away.
2;3;Auto Erotic Assimilation;Summer;Actually, no. I think Unity's great and you're a horrible influence on it!
2;3;Auto Erotic Assimilation;Rick;What?
2;3;Auto Erotic Assimilation;Morty;This isn't healthy, Rick! Y- you know you-you're really up to no good around here. I-at-at this place,  you know?
2;3;Auto Erotic Assimilation;Summer;You and Unity are like... like... leggings and mid-calf boots. You think you're great together but you're just bringing out the worst in each other!
2;3;Auto Erotic Assimilation;Rick;Oh, gee, boy Summer, well put. Uh, why don't we see what Unity thinks. Unity?
2;3;Auto Erotic Assimilation;Unity;I'm just taking a little break from stuff. You know? I need to relax.
2;3;Auto Erotic Assimilation;Rick;Oh, hey, wh-what's this on the news, guys? L-l-let me turn it up.
2;3;Auto Erotic Assimilation;Unity;In the news today, this looks a lot worse than it is. We’re... really just having a good time. Karen?
2;3;Auto Erotic Assimilation;Unity;Thanks
2;3;Auto Erotic Assimilation;Rick;I think you two are a little outnumbered.
2;3;Auto Erotic Assimilation;Summer;Okay! Well, what if you did it for me? What if you came with us as a favour to us... because you love us?
2;3;Auto Erotic Assimilation;Rick;What? Dumb. Bye.
2;3;Auto Erotic Assimilation;Morty;But Rick, Summer's just-
2;3;Auto Erotic Assimilation;Rick;Summer's just a hyper-emotional, needy little- what's the word I'm looking for here... uh- human! It runs in the family! I can tolerate it but I can't give a crap about it. Take a hike.
2;3;Auto Erotic Assimilation;Summer;Take care of yourself, Unity.
2;3;Auto Erotic Assimilation;Rick;I'm not looking for judgement, just a yes or no. Can you assimilate a giraffe?
2;3;Auto Erotic Assimilation;Beth;You're the worst!
2;3;Auto Erotic Assimilation;Jerry;No! You're the worst! You don't support this family!
2;3;Auto Erotic Assimilation;Jerry;All you care about is yourself!
2;3;Auto Erotic Assimilation;Beth;You think supporting the family is about supporting you emotionally...
2;3;Auto Erotic Assimilation;Jerry;You've got two children being dragged across the cosmos...
2;3;Auto Erotic Assimilation;Beth;...but you're unsupportable! Because it's never enough, Jerry!
2;3;Auto Erotic Assimilation;Jerry;...by your dangerously ill father, and you force me to watch it happen!
2;3;Auto Erotic Assimilation;Beth;It will never be enough support to satisfy you! And you don't even know what it's like...
2;3;Auto Erotic Assimilation;Jerry;Because you'd rather lose them and lose me than lose him!
2;3;Auto Erotic Assimilation;Beth;...to be afraid of losing anything because you cling and you cling and you cling...
2;3;Auto Erotic Assimilation;Jerry;And why? Because you're the child, Beth. You, not me, you!
2;3;Auto Erotic Assimilation;Jerry;Aaah!
2;3;Auto Erotic Assimilation;Beth;Oh my god!
2;3;Auto Erotic Assimilation;Beth and Jerry;Aah!
2;3;Auto Erotic Assimilation;Blim Blam;Um, first of all, hello. Uh, my name is Blim Blam the korblok. Second of all, cards on the table,I am a murderer that eats babies and I came to this planet to eat babies. However
2;3;Auto Erotic Assimilation;Blim Blam;You know what? I'm taking this.
2;3;Auto Erotic Assimilation;Blim Blam;How do you- what is this?
2;3;Auto Erotic Assimilation;Blim Blam;Uh, is there a slow setting? Best door ever.
2;3;Auto Erotic Assimilation;Rick;Aaah!  Okay, okay, now make him cry. But happy cry. Now make ‘em all make fun of the blonde one. Now make ‘em all do it on the table! I can’t believe you created a whole show for me. Now cancel it! Okay, now put it back on. Haha!  Alright, I’m bored.
2;3;Auto Erotic Assimilation;Unity;Rick, is there a way for you to call Summer and Morty? I feel bad that they-
2;3;Auto Erotic Assimilation;Rick;Pfft, screw those guys! Uugh, I'll be right back. Don't waste your brain on those weirdos, Unity. They're no different from any other aimless chumps that you occupy. They just put you at the centre of their lives because you're powerful and then because they put you there they want you to be less powerful. Never gonna happen though, right?
2;3;Auto Erotic Assimilation;Unity;Never.
2;3;Auto Erotic Assimilation;Rick;Never! Back in a flash.
2;3;Auto Erotic Assimilation;Rick;Best weekend ever, Rick! I agree, Rick! Let's see how long we can go!
2;3;Auto Erotic Assimilation;Rick;Hey Une! You got any more-
2;3;Auto Erotic Assimilation;Unity;Rick, forgive me for doing this in notes. I'm not strong enough to do it in persons.
2;3;Auto Erotic Assimilation;Unity;I realize now that I'm attracted to you for the same reason I can't be with you. You can't change. And I have no problem with that, but... it clearly means I have a problem with myself.
2;3;Auto Erotic Assimilation;Unity;I'm sure there's no perfect version of me. I'm sure I'll just unify species after species and never really be complete.
2;3;Auto Erotic Assimilation;Unity;But I know how it goes with us. I lose who I am and become part of you. Because in a strange way you're better at what I do without even trying. Yours, and nobody else's, Unity. P.S. I don't know where those coal miners were before they got assimilated. You might want to get checked.
2;3;Auto Erotic Assimilation;Rick;Hey.
2;3;Auto Erotic Assimilation;Beth;Dad...  I... um... Jerry and I were looking for our weed whacker, and found your subterranean lair... and your alien prisoner. And... he got away. And I know I sound like mom but I can't sacrifice this whole family's safety just because I'm afraid you'll leave again, so no more alien prisoners, and, no more subterranean excavation without consulting us.
2;3;Auto Erotic Assimilation;Rick;Okay.
2;3;Auto Erotic Assimilation;Beth;...Okay? Y-y-y-y-Okay like you're gonna quietly teleport somewhere and never come back?
2;3;Auto Erotic Assimilation;Rick;No. It's your house.
2;3;Auto Erotic Assimilation;Summer;Grandpa Rick! What happened... with Unity?
2;3;Auto Erotic Assimilation;Rick;Who? Oh. Unity. Yeah, well, I mean honestly we’re talking about an entity that thrives on enslavement, you know. It's not cool. Fun's fun but who needs it? I'll be in the garage.
2;3;Auto Erotic Assimilation;Rick;Unity! Unity! Unity!
2;3;Auto Erotic Assimilation;Beta-7;How can I assist you?
2;3;Auto Erotic Assimilation;Rick;I wanna talk to  Unity. Beta-7, I know it's in there!
2;3;Auto Erotic Assimilation;Beta-7;You're classified as a hostile entity, and Unity doesn't want to talk to you.
2;3;Auto Erotic Assimilation;Rick;I know your game, Beta-7, I’ve met a billion of you, you little on-deck in-the-wind shoulder to cry on!
2;3;Auto Erotic Assimilation;Beta-7;You are classified as a hostile entity.
2;3;Auto Erotic Assimilation;Rick;Well, you're just loving this, mother f- this isn't gonna shape out like you think, pal! Unity's not into other hiveminds! It's gonna suck you in and use you up and a month from now I'm going to be making out with all of you in a bunch of red wigs! Unity! Unity! Unity, I know you can hear me! Get out here!
2;3;Auto Erotic Assimilation;Beta-7;Weapons systems engaged.
2;3;Auto Erotic Assimilation;Rick;Oh, in your dreams you have weapons systems.
2;3;Auto Erotic Assimilation;Morty;Ugh, Rick, you said we were going to a movie.
2;3;Auto Erotic Assimilation;Rick;We are, Morty. Alright, Beta-shit-7, you just got saved by the bell, bitch!
2;4;Total Rickall;Jerry;Steve, I just got a weird e-mail. Did you buy us airline tickets?
2;4;Total Rickall;Uncle Steve;Aw shoot, it was supposed to be a surprise! I wanted to thank you for letting me live here all this time, so I'm treating the family to a vacation!
2;4;Total Rickall;Beth;Steve, you're so sweet!
2;4;Total Rickall;Morty;Thanks Uncle Steve!
2;4;Total Rickall;Summer;Best uncle ever!
2;4;Total Rickall;Uncle Steve;Look out world, the Smith family is goin' to Paris!
2;4;Total Rickall;Summer;Yeah! Awesome!
2;4;Total Rickall;Jerry;Rick, I don't like glowing rocks in the kitchen trash.
2;4;Total Rickall;Rick;Well, I don't like your unemployed genes in my grandchildren, Jerry. But life is made of little concessions.
2;4;Total Rickall;Jerry;I, you know what, I-
2;4;Total Rickall;Uncle Steve;You're gonna land on your feet Jer. Some company out there's gonna thank they're lucky stars they hired my little brother.
2;4;Total Rickall;Rick;Who the fuck are you?
2;4;Total Rickall;Jerry;My goofy brother Steve. He's been living here almost a year now, are you losing your mind?
2;4;Total Rickall;Uncle Steve;Hey someone's been spending too much time around glowing rocks am I right? 
2;4;Total Rickall;Morty;What the hell, Rick? What the hell?
2;4;Total Rickall;Rick;"Everybody just relax for a second. There's no such thing as an ""Uncle Steve"". That is an alien parasite."
2;4;Total Rickall;Jerry;But I've known him my whole life!
2;4;Total Rickall;Rick;No, you haven't Jerry.  These telepathic little bastards, they embed themselves in memories they use those to multiply, spread out, and take over planets. It's disgusting.
2;4;Total Rickall;Morty;Steve wasn't real?
2;4;Total Rickall;Rick;He's a real piece of shit! This is a big one, someone probably tracked in last week on the bottom of their shoe or on a piece of alien fruit.
2;4;Total Rickall;Summer;Someone?
2;4;Total Rickall;Rick;Get off the high road, Summer. We all got pink eye because you won't stop texting on the toilet.
2;4;Total Rickall;Morty;But Uncle Steve taught me how to ride a bike.
2;4;Total Rickall;Rick;"No, Steve"" put that memory in your brain so he could live in your house,  eat your food, and multiply. We could be infested with these things,  so we gotta keep an eye out for any zany, wacky characters that pop up."
2;4;Total Rickall;Mr. Poopybutthole;Ooh wee, whatever you want Rick! We're here to help!
2;4;Total Rickall;Rick;Thanks Mr. Poopybutthole. I always could count on you. 
2;4;Total Rickall;Rick;Alright, there's six of us and that's it. Me, Morty, Jerry, Beth, Mr. Poopybutthole, and Summer.
2;4;Total Rickall;Mr. Poopybutthole;Maybe you got the first one in time Rick!
2;4;Total Rickall;Rick;Can't afford to chance it.
2;4;Total Rickall;Beth;Dad, why does our house have blast shields?
2;4;Total Rickall;Rick;Trust me, Beth, you don't wanna know how many answers that question has.
2;4;Total Rickall;Mr. Poopybutthole;Ooh, gosh, it feels claustrophobic! Reminds me of that time we all got stuck in the elevator together. Y-- remember that? After the Hulk musical?
2;4;Total Rickall;Beth;Jerry, buttons don't work better if you hit them harder, and foam fists don't make you strong.
2;4;Total Rickall;Jerry;I know. Friends make you strong. I watched the same musical you did.
2;4;Total Rickall;Rick;Why couldn't I bring my portal gun?
2;4;Total Rickall;Morty;Why did all the drinks have to be extra large? Oh, the Hulk. I just got that.
2;4;Total Rickall;Summer;Just pee your pants. I did it the minute we got stuck.  Oh, oh, yeah, yeah, shame me. At least when I'm disgusting, it's on purpose.
2;4;Total Rickall;Mr. Poopybutthole;Oh, y'all, we're gonna be fine. I've always been here for you guys, and I always will be. 
2;4;Total Rickall;Nicky;Somebody call for repairs?
2;4;Total Rickall;All;Yay! Cousin Nicky!
2;4;Total Rickall;Nicky;It's me, Cousin Nicky. I'm walkin' here! I mean, I'm not. I'm crouched in the elevator shaft, but hey, I'm walkin' here! 
2;4;Total Rickall;Nicky;It's true. We really do get into some crazy situations as a family, mostly when we're cooped up like this. Hey, maybe Mr. Poopypants is right. L-let's get some fresh air.
2;4;Total Rickall;Morty;Come on, cousin Nicky. You heard Rick. We have to stay quarantined until we know that there's no more of these things.
2;4;Total Rickall;Nicky;"I hear you, Morty. Back in Brooklyn, we got a sayin' -- we're walkin' here!"" """
2;4;Total Rickall;Jerry;Nicky! 
2;4;Total Rickall;Nicky;Oh!  
2;4;Total Rickall;Morty;What the...? Cousin Nicky was a parasite?!
2;4;Total Rickall;Rick;Six, Morty! There's supposed to be six of us! If there's seven, then that means somebody's not real.
2;4;Total Rickall;Beth;But how did you know it was Nicky?
2;4;Total Rickall;Rick;I guessed. That's why I aimed for his shoulder.
2;4;Total Rickall;Beth;So we can't trust any of our memories now? Nicky was the reason we found that old nazi submarine. Did that not even happen?
2;4;Total Rickall;Jerry;Well, of course it happened.
2;4;Total Rickall;Nazi;Now that I possess the mighty staff of Rah-gubaba, the world will tremble before the Fourth Reich!
2;4;Total Rickall;Morty;This is the last time I ask you for help on my history final, Rick.
2;4;Total Rickall;Nicky;Hey, we got a word for Nazis back in Brooklyn, pal.
2;4;Total Rickall;Nazi;I'm comfortable being called a Nazi. You think there's some other word that will hurt my feelings?  Yeah. Think before you talk shit. Rah-gubaba, help me kill America! 
2;4;Total Rickall;All;Mr. Beauregard!
2;4;Total Rickall;Mr. Beauregard;After due consideration, I have elected not to retire.
2;4;Total Rickall;All;Yeah! Oh, thank god!
2;4;Total Rickall;Mr. Beauregard;Now, I believe someone has a final exam to attend. Set a course for Morty's high school.
2;4;Total Rickall;Mr. Beauregard;Perhaps I'm biased, but if that story never happened, then I wouldn't still be the family butler.  dare to dream.
2;4;Total Rickall;Rick;Wait.
2;4;Total Rickall;Summer;And if Mr. Beauregard wasn't our butler, it's safe to say the family'd be in a hell of a lot of trouble. 
2;4;Total Rickall;Rick;No! Don't flashback!
2;4;Total Rickall;Summer;You're just gonna make more swelling.
2;4;Total Rickall;Beth;Don't worry, Jerry. Just relax. We called the fire department.
2;4;Total Rickall;Jerry;You know they won't come here anymore. 
2;4;Total Rickall;Mr. Beauregard;Marmalade is served. 
2;4;Total Rickall;Frankenstein;I guess I take back what I said about British cuisine. 
2;4;Total Rickall;Rick;Take that!
2;4;Total Rickall;Sleepy Gary;We're trying to sleep.
2;4;Total Rickall;Morty;I don't want to go to the dance alone.
2;4;Total Rickall;Mr. Beauregard ;Then perhaps, you shouldn't.
2;4;Total Rickall;Beth;Aww. Mr. Beauregard.
2;4;Total Rickall;Mr. Beauregard;Shall we, master Morty?
2;4;Total Rickall;Morty;We shall.
2;4;Total Rickall;Beth;Oh, wait, don't leave without letting Photography Raptor take a picture.  
2;4;Total Rickall;Rick;Everybody stop remembering! These parasites are like bed bugs, and every flashback is another mattress. Look! There's only supposed to be six people in this house.
2;4;Total Rickall;Morty;But there's always been 10.
2;4;Total Rickall;Rick;No! Uh, the fact that I wrote this number down means that there's four parasites.
2;4;Total Rickall;Frankenstein;You sure about that, Rick?
2;4;Total Rickall;Mr. Beauregard;Begging your pardon, master Rick, but I seem to recall a great deal of confusion surrounding that number.
2;4;Total Rickall;Rick;All right, there's six of us,  and that's it. Me, Morty, Jerry, Beth, Mr. Poopybutthole, Frankenstein, Sleepy Gary, Photography raptor, Mr. Beauregard, and Summer.
2;4;Total Rickall;Beth;Uh, dad, that's like 10 people.
2;4;Total Rickall;Rick;6, 10, what's the difference? I just love the number 6 for no reason! Where's my pencil at?
2;4;Total Rickall;Pencilvester;Right here, Rick! Use me!
2;4;Total Rickall;Rick;Oh, thanks, Pencilvester!  Yeah,I-I g-- I guess that is what happened, but I-I don't get why I would do that.
2;4;Total Rickall;Pencilvester;Everybody makes mistakes, Rick. Why do you think I have one of these? 
2;4;Total Rickall;Beth;That's it. Photos. Hard evidence.  You're not in any of my photos, Mr. Poopybutthole.
2;4;Total Rickall;Mr. Poopybutthole;Well, what do you know about this? You're not in any of mine.
2;4;Total Rickall;Summer;All I have are pictures of me and my friends from school.  What? What teenage girl has pictures of her family? It's not like we're Mormon or dying.
2;4;Total Rickall;Frankenstein;I will admit it's suspicious that Summer's only friend is a magic ballerina lamb that we've never seen.
2;4;Total Rickall;Tinkles;Summer!
2;4;Total Rickall;Summer;Tinkles! It's past my bedtime.
2;4;Total Rickall;Tinkles;Not in never past bedtime land! Here we go!
2;4;Total Rickall;Summer;Ooh! Ooh! Ooh! Ooh! Ooh! Ooh! Ooh!
2;4;Total Rickall;Gary;Summer, we're trying to sleep.
2;4;Total Rickall;Summer;It was Tinkles! Tinkes?
2;4;Total Rickall;Rick;That is su--  -- suspicious. We're always hearing about this Tinkles character, but we never get to –
2;4;Total Rickall;Tinkles;Hi, everybody. I'm Tinkles, and these are my friends. 
2;4;Total Rickall;Summer;See, everyone? Tinkles is real. That means so am I.
2;4;Total Rickall;Frankenstein;I was on the wrong side of the pitchfork on this one.
2;4;Total Rickall;Jerry;Okay, look, we shouldn't need evidence or logic to know who's family and who isn't. I know who the Smiths are. I've known Beth since high school. And her husband, Sleepy Gary, is hands down my absolute best friend.
2;4;Total Rickall;Sleepy Gary;Thanks, Jerry. Beyond that, no offense to any of you, but all bets are off.
2;4;Total Rickall;Rick;Look, I'm not used to being this unsure for this long. I'm just gonna aim for shoulders starting with the weird girl. 
2;4;Total Rickall;Summer;Aah! Grandpa Rick!
2;4;Total Rickall;Rick;Hold still, Summer.
2;4;Total Rickall;Gary;Rick, that is my daughter.
2;4;Total Rickall;Rick;Oh, yeah? Well, what if you just think that, Sleepy Gary? I've known you for 15 years. Don't make me hurt you.
2;4;Total Rickall;Sleepy Gary;Rick, these are our family and friends, the people we barbecue with. Have you forgotten the barbecue?
2;4;Total Rickall;Rick;Wait, why would you want me to -- You're one of them, aren't you?
2;4;Total Rickall;Hamurai;Rick, you love those barbecues, Rick. You love them. Hai!
2;4;Total Rickall;Amish Cyborg;Remember it, Rick?
2;4;Total Rickall;Rick;Shut up, Hamurai! Shut up, Amish Cyborg! What is this? '90s Conan?
2;4;Total Rickall;All;Remember the barbecue. Remember the barbecue. Remember the barbecue.
2;4;Total Rickall;Rick;You know what, Pencilvester? It took me my whole life to realize it, but I love barbecuing.
2;4;Total Rickall;Pencilvester;You're good at it, Rick.
2;4;Total Rickall;Rick;"Watch me, baby. I'm like Tom Cruise from, um, ""Cuisine"" or w-whatever that movie's called where he makes drinks. Yeah, check me out. I'm like Tom Cruise from ""Cuisine.""  Yeah. Is that what it's called? ""Cuisine""?"
2;4;Total Rickall;Pencilvester;Wow! Hey, everybody. Let's give it up for the grill master, Rick! Rick! Rick! Rick! 
2;4;Total Rickall;Rick;"Wait.  Noooooo! Shoot. Now look. It's like a ""Where's Waldo?"" page. Can you find me? Check out all these zany characters. We'll be right back after these messages."
2;4;Total Rickall;Sleepy Gary;I think you should put down the gun and we should get you to a doctor. What do you say we take down these blast shields?
2;4;Total Rickall;All;Yeah.
2;4;Total Rickall;Rick;Can't do that, Sleepy Gary. All right, everybody listen to me. I don't know if any of you guys are real, but this house has been infested with fake loved ones that spread through fake memories, and our planet will be destroyed if they get out. 
2;4;Total Rickall;Pencilvester;But Rick, even you have to admit you do tend to overreact to stuff.
2;4;Total Rickall;Rick;"You guys, we got to hurry. I just got back from Walmart. They're selling Nintendo 3ds systems for $149.99 on sale, plus every time you buy one, you get a $50 gift card. Brings the total price down to $110 after tax. Now, listen, we can flip those sons of bitches for 230 bucks apiece easy! They're all limited-edition Zelda"" ones. Hurry! Hurry! Come with me! We can be rich,  and we also all get to keep one and we can play Nintendo games! Nintendo give me free stuff."
2;4;Total Rickall;Rick;Okay, yes, I definitely remember doing that, but also, I would never do that.
2;4;Total Rickall;Pencilvester;Don't overreact, Rick.
2;4;Total Rickall;Jerry;Sleepy Gary, a word?
2;4;Total Rickall;Sleepy Gary;Sure, Jerry. Rick, keep a level head, okay? 'Cause I'll tell you a secret about Frankenstein -- He's actually Frankenstein's monster.
2;4;Total Rickall;Jerry;Sleepy Gary, m-my head is filled with memories of our friendship. I'm convinced that you're Beth's husband and I'm your friend, but if those memories can't be trusted, then...
2;4;Total Rickall;Sleepy Gary;Jerry, just say it.
2;4;Total Rickall;Jerry;Sleepy Gary, how do we know I'm real?
2;4;Total Rickall;Sleepy Gary;Jesus, Jerry. No, you're real. Hey, look at me. Now, I don't know which way is up out there, but I know us, and you're real, Jerry. Remember our vacation?
2;4;Total Rickall;Gary;They're filming that new Star Wars movie down the coast. Should we check it out?
2;4;Total Rickall;Jerry;Sure. Why not?
2;4;Total Rickall;Gary;Maybe we'll see Chewbacca.
2;4;Total Rickall;Jerry;I'd like that.
2;4;Total Rickall;Jerry;What are we doing?
2;4;Total Rickall;Gerry;I don't give a damn what else happens out there. You and I are going to survive this.
2;4;Total Rickall;Jerry;Okay. Hey, we agreed. Never in the house.
2;4;Total Rickall;Frankenstein;That's a cool watch there, Rick. Can I check it out?
2;4;Total Rickall;Rick;Uh, no thank --  Okay. Trying to figure out how to lower the blast shields, huh? Anybody here think it's suspicious that a lot of people in here can't wait to get out of here?
2;4;Total Rickall;Frankenstein;Ah, you're paranoid, Rick. You've been paranoid since 'nam.
2;4;Total Rickall;Rick;So, what are you gonna do when you rotate back to the world, Frankenstein?
2;4;Total Rickall;Frankenstein;Shi-i-i-i-t. I'mma bust a -- 
2;4;Total Rickall;Rick;No! Get out of my head, parasite! No! Drop it. Give me the gun, Frankenstein!  Give it back!
2;4;Total Rickall;All;Yeah!  Frankenstein!
2;4;Total Rickall;Rick; Is anyone here even real? Am I the only real person on earth?!
2;4;Total Rickall;Reverse Giraffe;Maybe. Or maybe, just maybe, we're all real. You know me. I'm reverse giraffe. I have a short neck and legs. I went to college with Hamurai.
2;4;Total Rickall;Hamurai;Hai!
2;4;Total Rickall;Reverse Giraffe;I saved Ghost In A Jar's life in Vietnam.
2;4;Total Rickall;Ghost in a Jar;Boo rah!
2;4;Total Rickall;Reverse Giraffe;And Beth, how many times have I been a shoulder for you to cry on?
2;4;Total Rickall;Beth; Too many.
2;4;Total Rickall;Reverse Giraffe;Okay, so maybe we're just all fake.
2;4;Total Rickall;Mrs. Refrigerator;That don't make no sense!
2;4;Total Rickall;Reverse Giraffe;Or maybe,  there's only one deceiver here -- The person that keeps telling us the path to salvation is being held prisoner and mistrusting each other.
2;4;Total Rickall;Rick;Hey, don't blame me! I tried to shoot Summer 10 minutes ago!
2;4;Total Rickall;Reverse Giraffe;I know we all have beloved memories of Rick, but are we really supposed to believe that a mad scientist inventor with a flying car just showed up on our doorstep after being gone for years?
2;4;Total Rickall;Morty;Yeah, you know, he does have a lot of really weird, made-up sounding catchphrases.
2;4;Total Rickall;Rick;Wubba lubba dub dub! Ricky ticky tavi, beyotch! And that's the wa-a-a-a-y the news goes. Hit the sack, jack. Uh-oh! Somersault jump. Aids! And that's why I always say shum shum shlippedy dop! Grassss tastes bad-ah. No jumpin' in the sewer. Burger time! Rubber baby baby bunkers! Lick, lick, lick my balls!  yeah! Say that all the time.
2;4;Total Rickall; All; That's a fake-ass catchphrase right there.
2;4;Total Rickall;Beth;And don't forget his incredibly vague back story.
2;4;Total Rickall;Rick;Beth, I'm your father!
2;4;Total Rickall;Beth;Oh, are you, dad? Are you?
2;4;Total Rickall;Morty;Rick, if you want to prove you're real, just do what any of the rest of us would do and -- and -- and open the blast shields and let us the hell out of here!
2;4;Total Rickall;Rick;Why don't you make me, implausibly naive pubescent boy with an old Jewish comedy writer's name?
2;4;Total Rickall;Mrs. Refrigerator;In your face!
2;4;Total Rickall;Morty;Give me the gun.  I'm not doing this in front of Pencilvester. Bring him to the garage.  All right, you listen to me, you son of a bitch parasite scum. We could either do this the easy way or the hard way. You know, y-y-y-- do you want to live? Then open the blast shield doors.
2;4;Total Rickall;Rick;Shut up, Morty, you brainwashed, little turd that might not even be real because I'm brainwashed, too.
2;4;Total Rickall;Morty;You know, Rick, this isn't easy for us. You know, w-we all remember you as a friend.
2;4;Total Rickall;Rick;Oh, oh, oh, really? Well, I remember you as a whiny, little piece of shit, Morty!
2;4;Total Rickall;Morty;Oh -- oh, yeah?
2;4;Total Rickall;Rick;Yeah! I've got about a thousand memories of your dumb little ass and about six of them are pleasant. The rest is annoying garbage. So why don't you do us both a favor and pull the trigger? Do it! Do it, motherfucker! Pull the fucking trigger!
2;4;Total Rickall;Duck with Muscles;Oh, wow. Baby Wizard was a parasite? He set me up with my wife. 
2;4;Total Rickall;Rick;What the hell?
2;4;Total Rickall;Morty;I figured it out, Rick! The parasites can only create pleasant memories. I know you're real because I have a ton of bad memories with you!
2;4;Total Rickall;Rick;Holy crap, Morty, you're right.
2;4;Total Rickall;Morty;Is -- is -- isn't that what you were trying to make me understand by yelling at me?
2;4;Total Rickall;Rick;Well, yeah, duh-doy. T-took you long enough. 
2;4;Total Rickall;Rick;Now let's go, Morty. We got a lot of friends and family to exterminate. 
2;4;Total Rickall;Morty;Everybody remain calm! This is gonna take some explaining.
2;4;Total Rickall;Rick;We need to kill everyone that we can only remember fondly. Who's got a bad memory about Mrs. Refrigerator?
2;4;Total Rickall;Mrs Refrigerator;I-I-I-I -- everyone has bad memories of me. You remember that one time?  Ooh, man, we couldn't stop screaming.
2;4;Total Rickall;Beth;Uh, roller coasters aren't bad, Mrs. Refrigerator. They're thrilling. And you've been a perfect companion to me my entire life.
2;4;Total Rickall;Mrs Refrigerator;The jig is up!  get me out of here. Get me out of here! Aah!   Oh, shit!
2;4;Total Rickall;Rick;Everybody back! If you're not a parasite, you have nothing to fear. What about Summer?
2;4;Total Rickall;Summer;Why am I always your go-to?
2;4;Total Rickall;Summer;Never go in my room again.
2;4;Total Rickall;Morty;I didn't!
2;4;Total Rickall;Morty;She's real. She's my bitch of a sister.
2;4;Total Rickall;Summer;Nice.
2;4;Total Rickall;Summer;Mom, are you driving me to --
2;4;Total Rickall;Beth;Hmm? Yeah, yeah, yes. What time?
2;4;Total Rickall;Summer;Oh, my god. Are you drunk?
2;4;Total Rickall;Beth;  What're you, my life coach?
2;4;Total Rickall;Summer;Your what?
2;4;Total Rickall;Summer;Oh! God! Oh. Oh, my gosh. Oh! God! Mom!
2;4;Total Rickall;Beth;Sweetheart, are you okay? I didn't mean to --
2;4;Total Rickall;Summer;I'm gonna have a bruise! It's picture day!
2;4;Total Rickall;Beth;It's not, don't overreact. I can clean it up.
2;4;Total Rickall;Summer; I want the police to take me!
2;4;Total Rickall;Summer;Morty, give a gun to the lady that got pregnant with me too early and constantly makes it our problem.
2;4;Total Rickall;Beth;Thank you, sweetie.
2;4;Total Rickall;Cross Teddy Bear;Beth, Beth, please!
2;4;Total Rickall;Beth;I thought it was too good to be true that we'd have compatible kidneys.     
2;4;Total Rickall;Rick; Come on, man. Haven't we ever had an uncomfortable silence or an awkward fart on a road trip? Come on, Pencilvester. Give me anything.
2;4;Total Rickall;Pencilvester;Rick, I'm Pencilvester. Listen to that name. You can't kill me.
2;4;Total Rickall;Rick;You're right. Kill Pencilvester.
2;4;Total Rickall;Tinkles;Summer, I've always loved you!
2;4;Total Rickall;Summer;Yep.
2;4;Total Rickall;Summer;Oh, my god!
2;4;Total Rickall;Morty;I-I-I thought you went to a concert!
2;4;Total Rickall;Summer;We forgot the tickets! Why in the kitchen?!
2;4;Total Rickall;Morty;I do it everywhere! Stop shaming me!
2;4;Total Rickall;Summer;You're not the victim here!
2;4;Total Rickall;Morty;I hate you, and I was thinking about your friend Grace!
2;4;Total Rickall;Summer;Aaaaaah!
2;4;Total Rickall;Mr. Beauregard;Ah. Master Rick. Remember when you weren't going to shoot me? 
2;4;Total Rickall;Rick;I guess I did the butler! Ha ha! Does -- d-does that scan?
2;4;Total Rickall;Ghost in a Jar;"Oh, I-I get it. It's a play on the butler did it."""""
2;4;Total Rickall;Rick;Thanks, ghost in a jar. You always were good at pointing out potentially obscure comedy.  
2;4;Total Rickall;Jerry;You got to hide me, Sleepy Gary.
2;4;Total Rickall;Sleepy Gary;Don't worry. I have a plan. If we can get to my boat, there's a -- 
2;4;Total Rickall;Jerry;No. No! Send me to Gary. I want to be with Gary.
2;4;Total Rickall;Beth;Whoa. What the hell?
2;4;Total Rickall;Jerry;Look out for that homeless guy!
2;4;Total Rickall;Beth;Open the door! Open the door! Open the door!
2;4;Total Rickall;Jerry;There isn't time! Just run!
2;4;Total Rickall;Beth;Get out here and help me!
2;4;Total Rickall;Jerry;They say you shouldn't do that! Just run!
2;4;Total Rickall;Beth;Ugh. Sorry, Jerry. You're real.
2;4;Total Rickall;Jerry;I'm a parasite!
2;4;Total Rickall;Beth;Yeah, but you're real.
2;4;Total Rickall;Beth;Uh, uh, I need time to forget about Sleepy Gary.
2;4;Total Rickall;Jerry;Me, too.
2;4;Total Rickall;Rick;From now on, let's all be careful to wash our hands when we get back from outer space. That goes for everyone.
2;4;Total Rickall;Jerry;This is depressing. We killed every good person in the house. We're what's left? What a family.
2;4;Total Rickall;Rick;At least we're real, Jerry. We're real. Rikki tikki tavi!
2;4;Total Rickall;Mr. Poopybutthole;Ooh, whee! Amen to that. Now, this little poopypants is hungry. Will somebody pass me a pork chop? 
2;4;Total Rickall;Mr. Poopybutthole;Huh. I-is -- is something wrong, Beth?
2;4;Total Rickall;Rick;No, Beth!
2;4;Total Rickall;Mr. Poopybutthole;Oh, fuck.
2;4;Total Rickall;Beth;Wait, but I --
2;4;Total Rickall;Mr. Poopybutthole;Oh, Beth! Why?!
2;4;Total Rickall;Jerry;I need an ambulance! There's been a shooting. My wife shot... Uh, my -- my wife shot a long-time family friend.
2;4;Total Rickall;Mr. Poopybutthole;Why?
2;4;Total Rickall;Summer;Oh, my god, oh, my god, oh, my god, Mr. Poopybutthole.
2;4;Total Rickall;Beth;I-I thought --
2;4;Total Rickall;Morty;Keep breathing!
2;4;Total Rickall;Mr. Poopybutthole;Oh, god. What's happening?
2;4;Total Rickall;Morty;Look at me! Look at me! Don't -- don't fall asleep!
2;4;Total Rickall;Mr. Poopybutthole;Is -- is this what bleeding to death is? Oh, whee. Is this how I die?
2;4;Total Rickall;Rick;Oh, geez! Oh, my god!
2;4;Total Rickall;Mr. Poopybutthole;Why would you do this? Beth. It's not supposed to hurt. I-I thought...  Ooh, whee.
2;4;Total Rickall;Beth;Oh, he -- he's looking a lot better.
2;4;Total Rickall;Rick;Listen, Beth, don't torture yourself. I made a similar mistake years ago, but, you know, on a planetary scale.
2;4;Total Rickall;Beth;Is, um, is he mad at me?
2;4;Total Rickall;Rick;"He's not pressing charges. I mean, that's got to be the you shot me"" equivalent of not being mad."""
2;4;Total Rickall;Beth;Can he have visitors?
2;4;Total Rickall;Doctor;He'd like to be alone. He told me to tell you he's sorry you didn't have bad memories of him? If you love him, you should leave.
2;4;Total Rickall;Rick; And that's the wa-a-a-a-y the news goes.
2;5;Get Schwifty;Man;Hey, golf is easy now!
2;5;Get Schwifty;Man;Aahh! Golf is hard again! Golf is hard agaaaaaaain!
2;5;Get Schwifty;Terry;The view here is the same as yours, Jim. A giant head has entered Earth’s gravity, triggering climate change and natural disasters we thought were impossible for at least another eight years.
2;5;Get Schwifty;Jim; Let’s not make this political, Terry. Do we know what this giant head wants?
2;5;Get Schwifty;Giant Head;SHOW ME WHAT YOU GOT.
2;5;Get Schwifty;Terry;Jim, you heard  said, “Show me what you got.”
2;5;Get Schwifty;Giant Head;SHOW ME WHAT YOU GOT. I WANT TO SEE WHAT YOU GOT. 
2;5;Get Schwifty;Rick;Oh boy. Time to go, Morty.
2;5;Get Schwifty;Morty;Uhh, where?
2;5;Get Schwifty;Rick;The Pentagon. I mean, not THE Pentagon.  The lame one, here on Earth.
2;5;Get Schwifty;Summer;Is it God? If it’s God, do we get out of school?
2;5;Get Schwifty;Beth;It’s not God, Summer.
2;5;Get Schwifty;Jerry;She’s allowed to think it’s God if she wants, honey!
2;5;Get Schwifty;Beth;Shut up, Jerry.
2;5;Get Schwifty;Jerry;Ok…
2;5;Get Schwifty;Beth;Dad, what do you know about this?
2;5;Get Schwifty;Rick;Morty and I are going to look into it. You guys hold tight.
2;5;Get Schwifty;Mr. Goldenfold;Scary stuff, huh? Pretty freaky. Hi, I’m Morty’s math teacher. I’m also part of the street team inviting folks to the church downtown so we can pray together.
2;5;Get Schwifty;Beth;How is praying going to help?
2;5;Get Schwifty;Mr. Goldenfold;Ma’am, a giant head in the sky is controlling the weather. Did you wanna play checkers? Let’s be rational! I’ll see you at God’s house! 
2;5;Get Schwifty;President;Gentlemen, gentlemen, one at a time! Simon?
2;5;Get Schwifty;Simon;SETI, NORAD, and every broadcaster on the planet are attempting to show this being what humanity’s got. String theory, world history, the human genome.
2;5;Get Schwifty;Nathan;Have you tried sending it launch codes? Mr. President, what America’s got is 70,000 megatons of KABOOM-BOOM! And I say we show it right up this floating head’s ass!
2;5;Get Schwifty;Guards;Hold it! Don’t move! 
2;5;Get Schwifty;Rick;Stay back! This watch turns people into snakes!
2;5;Get Schwifty;President;Stand down. Everybody stand down! I’m the leader of these people and I’m unarmed. There’s no need for any more snake-makery.
2;5;Get Schwifty;Rick;My name is Rick Sanchez. This here’s my grandson Morty. 
2;5;Get Schwifty;Everyone;Hi, Morty.
2;5;Get Schwifty;Morty;Hey.
2;5;Get Schwifty;Rick;I’ve seen enough of the galaxy to know that what we’ve got here is a Cromulon from the Cygnus-5 Expanse. So you can forget about nukes, and you can forget about math.  This head won’t go away until  Earth shows them it’s got a hit song.
2;5;Get Schwifty;Everyone;Seriously, that’s impossible, etc…
2;5;Get Schwifty;Simon;You mean like Vivaldi?
2;5;Get Schwifty;Rick;No, Frasier. A live performance of a newly-written, catchy, original song. The Cromulon feed on the talent and showmanship of less-evolved lifeforms.
2;5;Get Schwifty;President;All right, all right. Thank you, Mr. Sanchez. Change of plan, people. Get me Pharrell, Randy Newman, Billy Corgan, and The-Dream.  The-Dream? He wrote “Umbrella” and “Single Ladies”? You people haven’t heard of The-Dream?
2;5;Get Schwifty;Rick;You’re gonna wanna put them on that giant speaker system at your sonic testing facility at Area 51.
2;5;Get Schwifty;Nathan;How do you know about that?
2;5;Get Schwifty;President;For God’s sake, Nathan, the man turns people into snakes. He can use Google Maps.
2;5;Get Schwifty;Aide;Sir! Pharrell, Newman, Corgan, and that Dream guy. They’re all dead.
2;5;Get Schwifty;President;What? How is that possible? Do people just die when I name them?
2;5;Get Schwifty;Aide;The Grammys, sir. There was an earthquake and all the musicians...  All the famous ones, they’re gone.
2;5;Get Schwifty;President;Dear God.
2;5;Get Schwifty;Aide;Hold on, sir, just a minute. Ice-T survived. He’s inbound on an F-15, ETA two hours.
2;5;Get Schwifty;Rick;Good luck, Mr. President.
2;5;Get Schwifty;Simon;Sir, the magnetic poles are about to reverse. In two hours, there may not be an Earth to save.
2;5;Get Schwifty;President;Sanchez! Are you a musician?
2;5;Get Schwifty;Rick;I dabble, Mr. President.
2;5;Get Schwifty;President;Get this man and his grandson on a Blackhawk to Area 51.
2;5;Get Schwifty;Father Bob;People! Everyone! Remain calm! Every crisis of faith is an opportunity for more faith! When God deals you an 11, you don’t fold! You double down, and always hit on a soft 16. That means you, Jews.
2;5;Get Schwifty;Jew;I beg your pardon, pastor, but the last I looked outside, it seems to be you that’s been dealt the weak hand. Jews rule!  Nobody? Ok, tough church.
2;5;Get Schwifty;Principal Vagina;Hi, Principal Vagina. The name’s real, possibly Scandinavian. I’m just gonna come out and make this pitch. The old gods are dead. Fuck all previous existing religions. All hail the one true god, the giant head in the sky.
2;5;Get Schwifty;Principal Vagina;Ah, di di di di.  Bob, Bob, I get it. But unless this  can beat that… what have you done for me lately?  So if you wanna excuse me, I’m going out on the sidewalk and dropping to my knees and pledging my eternal soul to the thing that literally controls the fucking weather!  Outta my way!
2;5;Get Schwifty;Pastor Bob;Ok, if sanity’s been restored to this assembly, I’d like to talk about the cost of repairing our new organ. Sally, the plate, please.
2;5;Get Schwifty;Mr. Goldenfold; Ohhhh, this is my favorite part!
2;5;Get Schwifty;Morty;Rick, are you really a musician?
2;5;Get Schwifty;Rick;Who’s NOT a musician, Morty?
2;5;Get Schwifty;Morty;Me!
2;5;Get Schwifty;Rick;Yeah, not with that attitude.
2;5;Get Schwifty;Jump Master;We’re in the drop zone! I’m the jump master! My name’s Jamey! With an E-Y! Go, go, go! 
2;5;Get Schwifty;Morty;B-b-but we don’t have a song!
2;5;Get Schwifty;Principal Vagina;Giant head in the sky, please forgive all that we’ve done. We’re sorry for increased levels of emissions and our racism. And of course, the amber alerts I keep ignoring on my phone.
2;5;Get Schwifty;Rick and Morty;WhooooOOOOAHHHH!!!!
2;5;Get Schwifty;Rick; All right, Morty, let’s get ready to do it! Why don’t you, uh, find a button on one of those keyboards and lay down some kind of beat?
2;5;Get Schwifty;Morty;Rick, I think we need to cut our losses. We get our family and portal out of here!
2;5;Get Schwifty;Rick;Morty! Good music comes from people who are relaxed. Just hit a button, Morty! Gimme a beat!
2;5;Get Schwifty;Morty;Oh man, ok, all right, um…
2;5;Get Schwifty;Rick;Ahhhhh yeahhhhh. Ya gotta get schwifty. Ya gotta get schwifty in here. It’s time to get schwifty.
2;5;Get Schwifty;Nathan;Get… schwifty? What the hell is that?
2;5;Get Schwifty;President;It’s our world’s best effort, that’s what.
2;5;Get Schwifty;Rick;Take off your pants and your panties. Shit on the floor. Time to get schwifty in here. I’m Mr. Bulldops.
2;5;Get Schwifty;Nathan;Mr. Bulldops?
2;5;Get Schwifty;President;Don’t analyze it, Nathan. It’s working!
2;5;Get Schwifty;Rick;Take a shit on the floor. Time to get schwifty in here.
2;5;Get Schwifty;Pastor Bob;And third-level donors get our all access family pass.
2;5;Get Schwifty;Summer;Listen! The storm is stopping!
2;5;Get Schwifty;Rick;Hey, take your pants off. It’s schwifty time today.
2;5;Get Schwifty;Giant Head;Hmmmm.
2;5;Get Schwifty;Principal Vagina;Please be kind to us for we are but tiny things with entire bodies stuck to your ground.
2;5;Get Schwifty;Giant Head;I LIKE WHAT YOU GOT. GOOD JOB.
2;5;Get Schwifty;Beth;Now hold on a second, let’s be rational about this.
2;5;Get Schwifty;Beth;No, I’m… I’m just saying, we don’t know if there’s a cause-effect relationship --
2;5;Get Schwifty;Beth;Oh, God, what’s going on now?
2;5;Get Schwifty;President;What the hell happened?
2;5;Get Schwifty;Aide;Mr. President, you’re gonna wanna see this.
2;5;Get Schwifty;Rick;I think planet Earth has just been transported.
2;5;Get Schwifty;Principal Vagina;The head has left and sent its children!
2;5;Get Schwifty;Beth;Holy CRAP!
2;5;Get Schwifty;Summer;Oh dear giant head, we apologize for that discussion! It will never happen again!
2;5;Get Schwifty;Simon;Sir, we’ve started picking up on a garbled signal. We’re decrypting it now.
2;5;Get Schwifty;Cromulon;WE ASKED THEM TO SHOW US WHAT THEY GOT. AND THEY DID. NOW WE’LL SEE WHICH OF THEM HAS GOT THE MOST. 24 HOURS, FIVE PLANETS, FIVE SONGS. BUT IN THE END, THERE CAN ONLY BE ONE. PLANET MUSIC! All participation is involuntary. Disqualified and losing planets are disintegrated by plasma ray.
2;5;Get Schwifty;Rick;Uhh, it’s probably a bad time to mention it, but any astronauts you guys had in orbit are definitely dead.
2;5;Get Schwifty;Cromulon;Welcome back to Planet Music! First up, let’s hear the latest song from planet Parblesnops. The Greebybobes! SHOW ME WHAT YOU GOT.
2;5;Get Schwifty;Greebybobe;Hold it, hold it, stop! Music isn’t about competition or captivity! If you love music, you love freedom. Let these worlds be free, please!
2;5;Get Schwifty;Cromulon;DISQUALIFIED!
2;5;Get Schwifty;Cromulon;There’s one every season. Moving on to planet Arbolez Meterosos. Arbolian Meterososians. SHOW US WHAT YOU GOT.
2;5;Get Schwifty;Arbolian Meterososian;Ah two, three, four…
2;5;Get Schwifty;Aide;Rick, Morty, Ice-T. The timetable’s moved up. Earth’s on in six hours.
2;5;Get Schwifty;Morty;Like we’re not already under enough pressure! 
2;5;Get Schwifty;Rick and Ice-T;Whoa ho ho ho ho!
2;5;Get Schwifty;Rick;Geez, Morty. The guy’s just doing his job. Take it easy.
2;5;Get Schwifty;Morty;Rick, Ice-T, could you guys take it less easy?! We’ve got six hours to come up with a song!
2;5;Get Schwifty;Rick;Genius happens in the moment, Morty. 
2;5;Get Schwifty;Morty;Well, can we at least go get our family? You know, so we can take them with-with-with us if we lose?
2;5;Get Schwifty;Rick;That’s planning for failure, Morty. Even dumber than regular planning.  Balls.
2;5;Get Schwifty;Rick;Morty, Morty, stop! Listen! There’s only so much charge left in this thing. If we portal home from here and back, we’re not gonna have enough charge left to get off-world. Get it?
2;5;Get Schwifty;Morty;What?!
2;5;Get Schwifty;Rick;Yeah,  you see, I try to shelter you from certain realities,  Morty. Cause if I let you make me nervous, then we can’t get schwifty.
2;5;Get Schwifty;Morty;Stop saying it like it’s a thing! You made it up!
2;5;Get Schwifty;Rick;Hey, Morty! Could you lick my… 
2;5;Get Schwifty;Morty;Rick, cut it out! That’s not funny, Rick!
2;5;Get Schwifty;Nathan;I’ve seen enough. These guys are one-hit wonders.
2;5;Get Schwifty;President;And what’s your plan, General?
2;5;Get Schwifty;Nathan;We still have the nuclear option. On my word, we can launch a nuclear missile at every one of those heads in the sky.
2;5;Get Schwifty;President;Our planet’s held captive on a live game show and your solution is to shoot the audience? You can put your faith in nukes if we get through this, General. Until then, I’ll put mine in Rick and Morty. “Get Schwifty” was a jam.
2;5;Get Schwifty;Principal Vagina;Hello? Yes sir, yeah. Thank you sir, thank you. He says he’s proud of what we’re doing and hopes we have a great Ascension Festival! Happy Ascension!
2;5;Get Schwifty;All;Happy Ascension!
2;5;Get Schwifty;Beth;We should pack up and leave town now.
2;5;Get Schwifty;Jerry;I think it’s inspiring that our community is coping with fear in a way that involves a festival and homemade ice cream. If you’d stop being such an evangelical atheist, you might start enjoying yourself.
2;5;Get Schwifty;Jerry;Whoa! Look at you! You’re wearing the hat and everything!
2;5;Get Schwifty;Summer;Here’s yours!  Mom, do you mind if I cook dinner tonight?
2;5;Get Schwifty;Beth;Yeah, sure. Wait, what??
2;5;Get Schwifty;Summer;I love you guys. You gave me life. And it’s the will of the many heads that all children honor their parents.
2;5;Get Schwifty;Beth;Dinner sounds nice.
2;5;Get Schwifty;Ethan;Pardon, Mr. and Mrs. Smith. Summer, are you coming to the Ascension?
2;5;Get Schwifty;Summer;Father, can we please go to the Ascension?
2;5;Get Schwifty;Jerry;Sure! Let’s go to the Ascension. Wh-wh-what is it?
2;5;Get Schwifty;Principal Vagina;We hereby send these un-wantables skyward that they might be inhaled by the many heads, later to be sneezed back to us as better babies!  Headward, free now to rise.  Headward, free now to rise.  Headward, free now to rise.
2;5;Get Schwifty;Summer;Oh yes, yes! Rise to the giant head! You are free to be free!
2;5;Get Schwifty;Ice-T;A squeegee comes up from the garage, right? And he’s got a lobster in one hand and movie tickets in the other. He’s like, “I’m ready!”
2;5;Get Schwifty;Ice-T;Who would take a lobster to see Iron Man 3?
2;5;Get Schwifty;Ice-T;Aw, damn. We’re out of original flavor Fig Newtons. I should get going anyway.
2;5;Get Schwifty;Rick;Wait, wait, wait! Come on, h-hold on a second!
2;5;Get Schwifty;Morty;What?!
2;5;Get Schwifty;Ice-T;Damn. You didn’t tell me you fuck around with portals and shit.
2;5;Get Schwifty;Morty;That’s it!
2;5;Get Schwifty;Rick;Whoa, whoa! Morty! Give me that!
2;5;Get Schwifty;Morty;You lied! You lied about the charge! You were just being lazy! Get back! Sit down!
2;5;Get Schwifty;Rick;Morty, just put it down. You don’t know what you’re doing.
2;5;Get Schwifty;Morty;I’m going to go find Mom and Dad.
2;5;Get Schwifty;Rick;Nooooo!
2;5;Get Schwifty;Rick;Ahhhh, shit!
2;5;Get Schwifty;President;Ah, shit.
2;5;Get Schwifty;Morty;Ahhh, shit.
2;5;Get Schwifty;Summer;And then Ethan played guitar and we learned the Seven Contemplations of the Head by singing them. It was really fun. Praise be the head!
2;5;Get Schwifty;Jerry and Beth;Praise be the…
2;5;Get Schwifty;Jerry;Yeah.
2;5;Get Schwifty;Principal Vagina;Hi folks, Head Priest Vagina. Thanks for farming all those potatoes. It’s 6 p.m., so if you’re a parent, you’re now entitled to adoration from your children.
2;5;Get Schwifty;Summer;I’m going to start dinner! 
2;5;Get Schwifty;Beth;I don’t know what to say. Summer is doing really well here.
2;5;Get Schwifty;Jerry;She’s aced every test in potato class, and look how important potatoes have become.
2;5;Get Schwifty;Beth;She’s not getting pregnant or doing drugs or missing curfew…
2;5;Get Schwifty;Balloon Man;Please help me! You can reach me if you try. Please help me!!
2;5;Get Schwifty;Beth;That’s not our business as long as Summer is thriving!
2;5;Get Schwifty;Summer;Taco time!  I hope it pleases you as the head desires.
2;5;Get Schwifty;Beth;That’s wonderful, Summer!
2;5;Get Schwifty;Jerry;We’re so proud of you. But honestly, you don’t have to make dinner every night.
2;5;Get Schwifty;Summer;Of course I do, silly!  Oh my God, daddy, I’m sorry I called you silly! I’m so sorry!  Heavenly head and cranial creator! Forgive my transgressions against family and community! May my chores complete me as I complete them!
2;5;Get Schwifty;Birdperson;Morty.
2;5;Get Schwifty;Morty;Birdperson?
2;5;Get Schwifty;Birdperson;You appear to be dying. I will make efforts to prevent this, but can promise nothing.
2;5;Get Schwifty;Rick;Wh-What do you think, Ice? Probably a little over-developed.
2;5;Get Schwifty;Ice-T;Shit. Over-developed, under-developed. Bad songs are bad songs.
2;5;Get Schwifty;Rick;Well, do you think maybe, could you give me some help with it, or… ?
2;5;Get Schwifty;Ice-T;Ah, hell no, man. You do your thing, but I can’t afford to get my pride wrapped up in your shame. You know what I’m sayin’?
2;5;Get Schwifty;Rick;Ice, I don’t want to be a negative Nelly or anything, but  if Morty doesn’t come back with my portal gun and I eat it out there, it’s, uh, kind of your problem too.
2;5;Get Schwifty;Ice-T;Pfff. I ain’t worried about no Earth blowin’ up, man.
2;5;Get Schwifty;Rick;What? Why not?
2;5;Get Schwifty;Ice-T;Yo, this is why.
2;5;Get Schwifty;Rick;What the fuck? You can turn into ice?
2;5;Get Schwifty;Ice-T;My story begins at the dawn of time in the far away realm of Alphabetrium. There, every being is a letter of the alphabet. But I was frozen and exiled to the cosmos by my elders as punishment for not caring enough about anything. Earth is just one of the many stops on my lifelong journey with no destination. So you better believe I don’t care if it blows up! Cause I’ll just be ice, floatin’ through space, like a comet!
2;5;Get Schwifty;Rick;Take it from me, Ice.  You can’t just  float around space not caring about stuff forever.
2;5;Get Schwifty;Ice-T;Pshhhh. Man, watch me. Good luck, Rick.
2;5;Get Schwifty;President;Ok, things are getting out of hand. I better make sure Rick has everything he needs to “get schwifty.”
2;5;Get Schwifty;Nathan;Oh, for God’s sake, that’s enough.
2;5;Get Schwifty;President;What the hell are you doing, Nathan? I’m the goddamn President of the United fuckin’ States!
2;5;Get Schwifty;Nathan;I’m setting the nuclear option to launch one minute into Earth’s performance. And you, Mr. President, I hope you like being hit in the face with a gun!
2;5;Get Schwifty;President;Wait, wait, wait, why-why --
2;5;Get Schwifty;Birdperson;I believe I can access the history of Rick’s gun and help you get back to him.
2;5;Get Schwifty;Morty;But can you help me get to my family? You know, at my house?
2;5;Get Schwifty;Birdperson;Is your intention to abandon Rick using his own portal gun? In bird culture, this is considered a dick move.
2;5;Get Schwifty;Morty;All of Rick’s moves are dick moves! Wh-what am I eating? What is this, bird seed?
2;5;Get Schwifty;Birdperson;It is random debris. I found it in my carpet. I don’t know what humans eat.
2;5;Get Schwifty;Tammy;You know what THIS human eats!
2;5;Get Schwifty;Birdperson;Don’t be gross, Tammy.
2;5;Get Schwifty;Tammy;Bird… dick.
2;5;Get Schwifty;Morty;Tammy… gross. Birdperson, you always stick up for Rick, but he doesn’t care about anyone but himself. He doesn’t think about the consequences of anything he does.
2;5;Get Schwifty;Birdperson;And as a result, he has the power to save or destroy entire worlds. And he is the reason you and I know each other. And the reason I’m alive at all.
2;5;Get Schwifty;Morty;What’s that? Who’s that baby?
2;5;Get Schwifty;Birdperson;Morty, suppose you could retrieve your family from Earth but had to abandon Rick. I could give your loved ones shelter on Birdworld, even jobs, possibly as worm ranchers. How often do you think you might look up at the stars and wonder what might have been had you just put your faith in Rick?
2;5;Get Schwifty;Cromulon;That was Chunky Tunk with “Full Ming Mong, Empty Gorp Dorp.” Up next, planet Earth!
2;5;Get Schwifty;Morty;Oh God! We’re up?!?!
2;5;Get Schwifty;Principal Vagina;Jerry and Beth, your family is a golden example of what Headism has to offer the world.
2;5;Get Schwifty;Beth;The world?
2;5;Get Schwifty;Principal Vagina;Headism is a hit. We’re taking it worldwide and would like Jerry to be our church’s “Head” of Advertising.
2;5;Get Schwifty;Jerry;You… would?
2;5;Get Schwifty;Principal Vagina;Beth, we’d like to promote you from horse surgeon, straight past human surgeon, to “Head” of Medicine.
2;5;Get Schwifty;Beth;That’s my dream! That’s my dream.
2;5;Get Schwifty;Jerry;Thank you. This is all so overwhelming, but, uh… we can’t.
2;5;Get Schwifty;Beth;Absolutely not.
2;5;Get Schwifty;Principal Vagina;I’m sorry?
2;5;Get Schwifty;Beth;We’ve been waiting 16 years for our daughter to respect us, but the key is, it has to be “our” daughter, not this person she’s become.
2;5;Get Schwifty;Jerry;We’ll take our chances raising her without fancy new jobs outside of a potato-based religion.  And you know what? I’m sick of pretending that we’re together because of the kids in the first place! I married you because you’re the love of my life!
2;5;Get Schwifty;Beth; And I‘m lucky to have you and I never tell you that! You know, we will come out of this stronger as a family!
2;5;Get Schwifty;Beth;Please don’t do this, please don’t do this! Summer!
2;5;Get Schwifty;Jerry;Summer, listen carefully. I stole a paper clip and I have it in my cheek but I don’t know what to do with it and it hurts.
2;5;Get Schwifty;Summer;You’re going to be ok!  You will come back as babies!
2;5;Get Schwifty;Jerry;I AM a baby! I’m a baby NOW!
2;5;Get Schwifty;Morty;Hello? Is anybody here?  Mr. President!
2;5;Get Schwifty;President;This is Bluebird. Code tango-niner-alpha. Abort launch. Abort! Hello?  He’s blocked me out.
2;5;Get Schwifty;Morty;Sir, I need to get to the stage and help Rick get schwifty!
2;5;Get Schwifty;President;It won’t matter how schwifty you get, Morty. The General’s got nukes set to launch halfway through Earth’s song!
2;5;Get Schwifty;Morty;Oh my God! C-c-can you fly a Blackhawk?
2;5;Get Schwifty;President;Can the Pope’s dick fit through a donut?
2;5;Get Schwifty;Morty;Uhhh, I’m not sure?
2;5;Get Schwifty;President;Exactly!
2;5;Get Schwifty;Cromulon;SHOW ME WHAT YOU GOT.
2;5;Get Schwifty;Rick;Ahem.  Uhhh… lop-oo-lop-oo-lop-oo-dups, nop-oo-nop-oo-nop-oo-nuts.
2;5;Get Schwifty;Principal Vagina;Headward free now to rise!
2;5;Get Schwifty;Mr. Goldenfold;Hey! Look at the heads! Looks like the heads are gettin’ angry!
2;5;Get Schwifty;President;I’m really bad at this, Morty! There are way too many buttons on this thing!
2;5;Get Schwifty;Morty;Mr. President, if I’ve learned one thing today, it’s that sometimes, you have to not give a fuck!
2;5;Get Schwifty;Rick;Nup-oo-nup-oo-nup-oo-nups… ooh, tough crowd.
2;5;Get Schwifty;Principal Vagina;I’m sure that has… that has nothing to do with this.
2;5;Get Schwifty;Summer;The heads are displeased! 
2;5;Get Schwifty;Ethan;Summer! 
2;5;Get Schwifty;Rick;Morty!
2;5;Get Schwifty;Mr. Goldenfold;The heads love this! They love it when we DON’T kill the Smith family!
2;5;Get Schwifty;Principal Vagina;No! Stop that! You’re not allowed to interpret the will of the heads!
2;5;Get Schwifty;President;Call off the nuclear strike! This is the President. Stop the nuclear missile launch!
2;5;Get Schwifty;Nathan;Just launch the missiles!
2;5;Get Schwifty;Cromulon;BOO! NOT COOL!
2;5;Get Schwifty;Principal Vagina;I’m the only one that speaks to the heads!
2;5;Get Schwifty;Cromulon;DISQUALIFIED!
2;5;Get Schwifty;Mr. Goldenfold;The heads disqualified Vagina! Get him!
2;5;Get Schwifty;Cromulon;DISQUALIFIED! DISQUALIFIED!
2;5;Get Schwifty;All;Ice-T?
2;5;Get Schwifty;Ice-T;That’s right, it’s me, Ice-T! I care now! You made me care more! With all due respect, I’d like to hear what Rick and Morty have to play.
2;5;Get Schwifty;Morty;What do you say, Rick?
2;5;Get Schwifty;Rick;I say…  Let’s do it!
2;5;Get Schwifty;Rick;All right!
2;5;Get Schwifty;Morty;Ohhhh yeahhhh!
2;5;Get Schwifty;Rick;Come on, here we go!
2;5;Get Schwifty;Morty;Ohhhh yeahhhh!
2;5;Get Schwifty;Rick;Say it with me!
2;5;Get Schwifty;All;Head bent over.Raised up posterior. Head bent over. Raised up posterior.
2;5;Get Schwifty;Principal Vagina;Ohhh my GOOOOODDDD!!!
2;5;Get Schwifty;All;Head bent over. Raised up posterior. Head bent over. 
2;5;Get Schwifty;Cromulon;After 988 seasons of Planet Music, the Cromulons have decided to declare Earth the final winner and bring our musical reality show to a conclusion. Goodbye!
2;5;Get Schwifty;All;Yeah, we did it!
2;5;Get Schwifty;Mr. Goldenfold;Did he just say “musical reality show”?
2;5;Get Schwifty;Jerry;Yeah, it’s possible that we may have been correlating some things that weren’t actually related at all.
2;5;Get Schwifty;Principal Vagina;HEEEEELLLLPPPP!!!!!
2;5;Get Schwifty;Beth;We should go get him.
2;5;Get Schwifty;President;I hope I can call on you again if we need you, Morty.
2;5;Get Schwifty;Morty;Sure thing! And I was kinda hoping that I could get a selfie with you?
2;5;Get Schwifty;President;Actually, if you try to tell anyone what happened here, we’ll deny it and probably worse.
2;5;Get Schwifty;Morty;Understood.
2;5;Get Schwifty;Nathan;DIIIIEEEE!!!!
2;5;Get Schwifty;President;Why didn’t he turn into a snake?
2;5;Get Schwifty;Rick;Trade secret, Mr. President. Particle beam in a wristwatch… snake holster on the leg.
2;5;Get Schwifty;President;I love this man!
2;5;Get Schwifty;Ice-T;Magnesium-J, Hydrogen-F. Father.
2;5;Get Schwifty;Magnesium-J;Word of your selfless acts on the Earth planet have travelled across the galaxy.
2;5;Get Schwifty;Ice-T;I have changed. I am ready to rejoin my brethren on Alphabetrium.
2;5;Get Schwifty;Magnesium-J;Very well. Your exile ends today!
2;5;Get Schwifty;Magnesium-J;Welcome home... Water-T.
2;5;Get Schwifty;Purple-P;The Numbericons! They’re attacking!
2;5;Get Schwifty;Magnesium-J;Battle stations!
2;5;Get Schwifty;Water-T;Father!
2;5;Get Schwifty;Magma-Q;I love you son. I should have never turned you to ice. 
2;5;Get Schwifty;Magnesium-J;Water-T, where are you going? There’s too many of them!
2;5;Get Schwifty;Water-T;Then I better crunch the numbers.
2;6;The Ricks Must Be Crazy;Morty;Geez, I can't believe we found a version of Earth with a Ball Fondlers movie franchise.
2;6;The Ricks Must Be Crazy;Summer;I can't believe the things this reality considers PG-13
2;6;The Ricks Must Be Crazy;Morty;Yeah, I'm pretty jealous.
2;6;The Ricks Must Be Crazy;Rick;"Don't be Morty, there are pros and cons to every reality, fun facts about this one; it's got giant telepathic spiders, eleven 9/11's, aaaand the best ice cream in the multiverse!"
2;6;The Ricks Must Be Crazy;Summer;Shut up! 
2;6;The Ricks Must Be Crazy;Morty;W-whoa!
2;6;The Ricks Must Be Crazy;Rick;We're gonna go get some ice-cream motherfuckers!
2;6;The Ricks Must Be Crazy;Rick;Oh great.
2;6;The Ricks Must Be Crazy;Morty;Oh boy. W-what's wrong Rick, is it the quantum carburettor or something?
2;6;The Ricks Must Be Crazy;Rick;"Quantum carburettor? Jesus Morty; you can't just add a sci fi word to a car word and hope it means something. Huh, it looks like something's wrong with the microverse battery - we're going to have to go inside."
2;6;The Ricks Must Be Crazy;Morty;Uhm. Go inside what?
2;6;The Ricks Must Be Crazy;Rick;"The battery Morty. Be right back Summer; stay put, don't touch any buttons, and ignore all random thoughts that feel -- spider-y."
2;6;The Ricks Must Be Crazy;Summer;Wait! You can't leave me here!
2;6;The Ricks Must Be Crazy;Rick;You'll be fine. Ship, keep Summer safe.
2;6;The Ricks Must Be Crazy;Ship;Keep. Summer. Safe.
2;6;The Ricks Must Be Crazy;Summer;Egh, wonderful.
2;6;The Ricks Must Be Crazy;Man;Hey, excuse me, hello?
2;6;The Ricks Must Be Crazy;Summer;Uhmm...
2;6;The Ricks Must Be Crazy;Man;What you think you're better than me? Nobody's better than me! Ey! ey!
2;6;The Ricks Must Be Crazy;Summer;Agh! Aghaaaa!
2;6;The Ricks Must Be Crazy;Ship;Keep. Summer. Safe.
2;6;The Ricks Must Be Crazy;Thinner Man;Hey man, what the hell! That was my daughter's paediatrician! Uagha!
2;6;The Ricks Must Be Crazy;Summer;No! Stop, don't kill him!
2;6;The Ricks Must Be Crazy;Ship;Confirmed.
2;6;The Ricks Must Be Crazy;Thinner Man;Uaghuu. Ugh. Uh. Oh God! I can't feel my legs! Help! He-elp!
2;6;The Ricks Must Be Crazy;Ship;Summer is safe.
2;6;The Ricks Must Be Crazy;Summer;I don't feel safe.
2;6;The Ricks Must Be Crazy;Ship;Confirmed.
2;6;The Ricks Must Be Crazy;Thinner Man;Oh God help me! Help me! help me please! You can help me.
2;6;The Ricks Must Be Crazy;Morty;Oh man. Where are we Rick?
2;6;The Ricks Must Be Crazy;Rick;Morty, remember eight seconds ago when when you said 'go inside what' and I said 'the battery' and then we showed up here?
2;6;The Ricks Must Be Crazy;Rick;"Morty, remember eight seconds ago when  when you said, Go inside what?"" And I said"
2;6;The Ricks Must Be Crazy;Morty;All right, all right. We're inside the battery. I get it. You don't have to bust my balls.
2;6;The Ricks Must Be Crazy;Rick;Huh, this isn't right. This pipe's supposed to be sending 20 terawatts of juice up to the engine, Morty.
2;6;The Ricks Must Be Crazy;Rick;Instead we've got... zero? Now what are these people doing?
2;6;The Ricks Must Be Crazy;Morty;W-w-w-whoa, people? 
2;6;The Ricks Must Be Crazy;Rick;It's time for some hands-on engine repair.All right, Morty, hold on to something.
2;6;The Ricks Must Be Crazy;Morty;Whoa!
2;6;The Ricks Must Be Crazy;Morty;Holy crap! I thought we were inside your car battery, Rick. T-t-this is like a whole p-planet or something.
2;6;The Ricks Must Be Crazy;Rick;Thanks, Morty. I'm pretty proud of this bad boy. Check it out.
2;6;The Ricks Must Be Crazy;Rick;I put a spatially tessellated void inside a modified temporal field until a planet developed intelligent life. I then introduced that life to the wonders of electricity, which they now generate on a global scale. And, you know, some of it goes to power my engine and charge my phone and stuff. 
2;6;The Ricks Must Be Crazy;Morty;You have a whole planet sitting around making your power for you? That's slavery.
2;6;The Ricks Must Be Crazy;Rick;It's society. They work for each other, Morty. They pay each other. They buy houses. They get married and make children that replace them when they get too old to make power. 
2;6;The Ricks Must Be Crazy;Morty;That just sounds like slavery with extra steps.
2;6;The Ricks Must Be Crazy;Rick;Ooh-la-la, someone's gonna get laid in college.
2;6;The Ricks Must Be Crazy;Anchor;It appears we are being revisited by the alien known as Rick, who once gave our world the gift of gooble box technology, which, when stomped on, generates electricity, powering our homes and businesses, improving our daily lives, while safely removing the dangerous waste power to a special disposal volcano. But why has Rick returned? And what will he say when he hears the big news? Let's find out.
2;6;The Ricks Must Be Crazy;Morty;You need to tell these people they're in a battery, Rick. It's messed up. There's caterers down there. Th-th-they're setting up chafing dishes.
2;6;The Ricks Must Be Crazy;Rick;Would you relax, Morty? There's nothing dishonest about what we're doing. Now slap on these antennae. These people need to think we're aliens.
2;6;The Ricks Must Be Crazy;Morty;What? Why?
2;6;The Ricks Must Be Crazy;Rick;Obviously you really know nothing about car repair.
2;6;The Ricks Must Be Crazy;Rick;Wait for the ramp, Morty. They love the slow ramp. Really gets their dicks hard when they see this ramp just slowly extending down.
2;6;The Ricks Must Be Crazy;Rick;Greetings!
2;6;The Ricks Must Be Crazy;Rick;"Morty, you got to flip them off. I told them it means Peace among worlds."" How hilarious is that?"""
2;6;The Ricks Must Be Crazy;Rick;Coming through. Two real aliens walking through here.
2;6;The Ricks Must Be Crazy;Mr.President;Rick, our alien friend.
2;6;The Ricks Must Be Crazy;Rick;Uh, Mr. President, um, couldn't help but notice that you were having problems generating power.
2;6;The Ricks Must Be Crazy;Mr.President;That's correct.  We've evolved. Our most brilliant scientist, Zeep Xanflorp, has developed a source of energy that makes gooble boxes obsolete. 
2;6;The Ricks Must Be Crazy;Rick; I would love to see it.
2;6;The Ricks Must Be Crazy;Mr.President;Fuck you.
2;6;The Ricks Must Be Crazy;Rick;What did you say to me?!
2;6;The Ricks Must Be Crazy;Mr.President;"Fuck you."" Y-you told me it means ""much obliged""."""
2;6;The Ricks Must Be Crazy;Rick;Oh. Right. Uh, b-blow me.
2;6;The Ricks Must Be Crazy;Mr.President;No, no, no. Blow me.
2;6;The Ricks Must Be Crazy;Mr.President;Zeep, you have an honored guest from beyond the stars.
2;6;The Ricks Must Be Crazy;Zeep;I said 12 quantum stabilizers, not 11. Fix it or it's your ass. Chris, I'm in the middle of something.
2;6;The Ricks Must Be Crazy;Mr.President;Zeep, is Rick-- The alien. Rick the alien. Rick the alien...
2;6;The Ricks Must Be Crazy;Rick;Really? You're gonna pull that move? I guided your entire civilization. Your people have a holiday named Ricksgiving. They teach kids about me in school.
2;6;The Ricks Must Be Crazy;Zeep;I dropped out of school. It's not a place for smart people.
2;6;The Ricks Must Be Crazy;Morty;Ohhhh, snap!
2;6;The Ricks Must Be Crazy;Rick;Listen to me, you arrogant little--
2;6;The Ricks Must Be Crazy;Mr.President; R-Rick was hoping to see your new energy source. I think he could learn a lot from you, Zeep.
2;6;The Ricks Must Be Crazy;Zeep;Fine. It's hard for people to grasp, but inside that container is an infinite universe with a planet capable of generating massive amounts of power. I call it a miniverse.
2;6;The Ricks Must Be Crazy;Rick;Dumb  name.
2;6;The Ricks Must Be Crazy;Zeep;Excuse me?
2;6;The Ricks Must Be Crazy;Rick;Nothing. I mean, it's hard for us to comprehend all this. Would it be possible for us to get some kind of tour of your miniverse from the inside?
2;6;The Ricks Must Be Crazy;Zeep;This isn't a fucking chocolate factory. I don't have time.
2;6;The Ricks Must Be Crazy;Mr.President;Didn't you say time goes more slowly in the miniverse relative to the real world?
2;6;The Ricks Must Be Crazy;Zeep;Yes, Chris. Thanks for reminding me of that. Great president. All right, let's go.
2;6;The Ricks Must Be Crazy;Morty;Whoa-oh!
2;6;The Ricks Must Be Crazy;Zeep;Hold on to something. I put an unbounded vacuum inside a temporal field until a world developed. I then introduced the people of this world to the wonders of electricity in the form of a device I call a flooble crank.
2;6;The Ricks Must Be Crazy;Zeep;What they don't know is that 80% of every crank's energy output gets channeled out of the miniverse to be used by us. No more gooble boxes.
2;6;The Ricks Must Be Crazy;Rick;I got to tell you, Zeep, with no disrespect, I really think what you're doing here is unethical. It's not cool.
2;6;The Ricks Must Be Crazy;Morty;What?!
2;6;The Ricks Must Be Crazy;Rick;Y-y-you got the people on this world slaving away  making your power. I mean, that's what I call slavery.
2;6;The Ricks Must Be Crazy;Zeep;No, no, no, they work for each other in exchange for money, which they then--
2;6;The Ricks Must Be Crazy;Rick;Well, that just sounds like slavery with extra steps.
2;6;The Ricks Must Be Crazy;Zeep;Eek barba dirkle, somebody's gonna get laid in college.
2;6;The Ricks Must Be Crazy;Morty;Rick, a word?
2;6;The Ricks Must Be Crazy;Morty;What the hell was that?
2;6;The Ricks Must Be Crazy;Rick;"I know. Eek barba dirkle""? That's a pretty fucked up ""ooh-la-la""."""
2;6;The Ricks Must Be Crazy;Morty;No, what are you doing telling this guy that his miniverse is unethical? Do you not see the hypocrisy here?
2;6;The Ricks Must Be Crazy;Rick;Holy crap. You're right, Morty. Hypocrisy. Somewhere on this planet, there's got to be an arrogant scientist prick on the verge of microverse technology, which would threaten to make Zeep's flooble cranks obsolete, forcing Zeep to say microverses are bad, at which point he'll realize what a hypocrite he's being, his people will go back to stomping on their gooble boxes, and you and I will be on ice cream street, baby! Eating that motherfucking ice cream! Slurping, slurping, slurping it up. 
2;6;The Ricks Must Be Crazy;Rick;Wh-wh-why are you making that face?
2;6;The Ricks Must Be Crazy;Morty;Holy shit!
2;6;The Ricks Must Be Crazy;Zeep;It's me. I've convinced the people of this planet that I'm a traveler from another world. 
2;6;The Ricks Must Be Crazy;Rick;You don't think that's overdoing it a little? I mean, you could achieve the same effect with a pair of-- Never mind. You know what? I shouldn't be so critical. I'm an alien.
2;6;The Ricks Must Be Crazy;Zeep;Places, please. We're about to land.
2;6;The Ricks Must Be Crazy;Rick;Too fast.
2;6;The Ricks Must Be Crazy;Ship;Law enforcement converging on location. Keep Summer safe.
2;6;The Ricks Must Be Crazy;Summer;No! No, no! Don't hurt anybody!
2;6;The Ricks Must Be Crazy;Ship;Confirm custom defense protocol-- Keep Summer safe-- No physical force.
2;6;The Ricks Must Be Crazy;Summer;Yes.
2;6;The Ricks Must Be Crazy;Ship;Processing.
2;6;The Ricks Must Be Crazy;Swat Officer 1;Come out of the vehicle with your hands in the air!
2;6;The Ricks Must Be Crazy;Ship;Scanning assailants.  Psychological option detected.  Gestating.
2;6;The Ricks Must Be Crazy;Summer;"""Gestating""?"
2;6;The Ricks Must Be Crazy;Swat Officer 1;Come out with your hands up, or we will be forced to open fire!
2;6;The Ricks Must Be Crazy;Swat Officer 1;Incoming!
2;6;The Ricks Must Be Crazy;Swat Officer 2;We got a device!
2;6;The Ricks Must Be Crazy;Swat Officer 1;Bomb! Bomb!
2;6;The Ricks Must Be Crazy;Kid;Daddy?
2;6;The Ricks Must Be Crazy;Swat Officer 1;Oh, my God.  Hunter?
2;6;The Ricks Must Be Crazy;Kid;Daddy?
2;6;The Ricks Must Be Crazy;Summer;What the hell?
2;6;The Ricks Must Be Crazy;Swat Officer 1; Jesus Christ, cease fire! Stay back! H-h-hunter?
2;6;The Ricks Must Be Crazy;Kid;Daddy.
2;6;The Ricks Must Be Crazy;Swat Officer 1;Hunter!  Oh, my dear, sweet God, Hunter. Oh, my boy. My boy. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. It was all my fault. I'm sorry.
2;6;The Ricks Must Be Crazy;Kid;Daddy, leave the car alone.
2;6;The Ricks Must Be Crazy;Swat Officer 1;W-w-w-what?
2;6;The Ricks Must Be Crazy;Kid; Leave the car alone.
2;6;The Ricks Must Be Crazy;Swat Officer 1;Hunter?
2;6;The Ricks Must Be Crazy;Swat Officer 1;Don't--
2;6;The Ricks Must Be Crazy;Summer;Oh, my God.
2;6;The Ricks Must Be Crazy;Swat Officer 1;Stay here, Hunter! No!  God, no! Hunter!
2;6;The Ricks Must Be Crazy;Ship;All of you have loved ones. All can be returned. All can be taken away. Please step away from the vehicle. Keep Summer safe.
2;6;The Ricks Must Be Crazy;Zeep;And if you continue to turn your flooble cranks, I will bring you other great alien advancements.
2;6;The Ricks Must Be Crazy;Rick;Hey, uh, let me ask you something.
2;6;The Ricks Must Be Crazy;Teenyverse President;Yes?
2;6;The Ricks Must Be Crazy;Rick;Any of your, uh, scientists working on anything new?
2;6;The Ricks Must Be Crazy;Teenyverse President;All of them. That's their job.
2;6;The Ricks Must Be Crazy;Rick;Yeah, yeah, yeah. But I mean, like, energy-wise. Anyone working on, say, a little universe in a box?
2;6;The Ricks Must Be Crazy;Teenyverse President;How do you know about that? It's top secret.
2;6;The Ricks Must Be Crazy;Zeep;"So remember-- a crank a day is not nearly enough.  Crank it. I told them this means Peace among worlds"". How hilarious is that?"""
2;6;The Ricks Must Be Crazy;Morty;Re-really funny, Zeep.
2;6;The Ricks Must Be Crazy;Rick;Hey, Zeep, the fake president of your fake world has something fake important to show you.
2;6;The Ricks Must Be Crazy;Kyle;It's not much now, but once I learn to accelerate the temporal field, I'll be able to interact with any sentient life that evolves and introduce them to the wonders of electricity via a pulley-based device I call a blooble yank. But what they won't know is--
2;6;The Ricks Must Be Crazy;Zeep;You'll be taking most of their energy. Yeah, yeah, yeah. I get it.
2;6;The Ricks Must Be Crazy;Rick; It's show time.
2;6;The Ricks Must Be Crazy;Zeep;You do realize this will make the flooble crank obsolete? This is wrong, Kyle. What you're doing is wrong. You're basically-- This is slavery. You're talking about creating a planet of slaves.
2;6;The Ricks Must Be Crazy;Rick; Told you, Zeep.
2;6;The Ricks Must Be Crazy;Kyle;Oh, they won't be slaves. They'll work for each other and pay each other money.
2;6;The Ricks Must Be Crazy;Zeep;That just sounds like slavery with ex... tra... steps.
2;6;The Ricks Must Be Crazy;Rick;What? 
2;6;The Ricks Must Be Crazy;Zeep;Wait a minute. Did you create my universe? Is my universe a miniverse?
2;6;The Ricks Must Be Crazy;Rick;Microverse!
2;6;The Ricks Must Be Crazy;Kyle;Uh, teenyverse.
2;6;The Ricks Must Be Crazy;Rick;Ugh! You bastard!
2;6;The Ricks Must Be Crazy;Zeep;Much obliged.
2;6;The Ricks Must Be Crazy;Kyle;What the hell is happening?
2;6;The Ricks Must Be Crazy;Morty;This is healthy, trust me.
2;6;The Ricks Must Be Crazy;Rick;You're my battery, motherfucker.  That's all you are. I made you. Your microverse sucks! And your miniverse is the size of a fucking lobster tank! It's whack!
2;6;The Ricks Must Be Crazy;Kyle;Are they not really aliens?
2;6;The Ricks Must Be Crazy;Morty;Nah, they're just a couple of crazy, wacky scientists, you know?
2;6;The Ricks Must Be Crazy;Kyle;So he made a universe, and that guy is from that universe. And that guy made a universe. And that's the universe where I was born. Where my father died. Where I couldn't make time for his funeral because I was working on my universe.
2;6;The Ricks Must Be Crazy;Rick;I made you!
2;6;The Ricks Must Be Crazy;Morty; Yeah. Science, huh? Ain't it a thing.
2;6;The Ricks Must Be Crazy;Morty;You know, one time, Rick sh-- accidentally shot his laser pistol right through my hand. You know, I mean, like, old-lady science, you know? She's a real-- You got to hang on tight, you know? Because she-- she'll-- She bucks pretty hard. Ooh, boy, what-- Oh, my God, no!
2;6;The Ricks Must Be Crazy;Rick; Zeep
2;6;The Ricks Must Be Crazy;Rick;Come on, come on, come on.
2;6;The Ricks Must Be Crazy;Rick;Pterodactyl!
2;6;The Ricks Must Be Crazy;Zeep; Asshole! When I get out of this teenyverse, I'm gonna smash it to pieces with you in it.
2;6;The Ricks Must Be Crazy;Rick;Yeah, well, when I get out of this teenyverse, I'm gonna get out of the surrounding miniverse and then the microverse around that, and guess what?
2;6;The Ricks Must Be Crazy;Morty;Don't make things worse, Rick! Uh, he's not gonna destroy your universe. You know, we-- We need it to start our car. 
2;6;The Ricks Must Be Crazy;Zeep;That's what you used my universe for? To run your car?
2;6;The Ricks Must Be Crazy;Rick;Yeah, but don't flatter yourself. There's always AAA, you fucking cocksucker!
2;6;The Ricks Must Be Crazy;Rick;What's he doing? What's he crafting? I can craft stuff, too, pal! Just like I crafted your reality!
2;6;The Ricks Must Be Crazy;Rick;You crafty son of a--
2;6;The Ricks Must Be Crazy;Zeep;Ow! I crafted the guy that created the planet you're standing on!
2;6;The Ricks Must Be Crazy;Rick;Yeah, and I made the stars that became the carbon in your mother's ovaries!
2;6;The Ricks Must Be Crazy;Zeep;I didn't ask to be born!
2;6;The Ricks Must Be Crazy;Morty;All right, that's it! I'm out. I-I'm gonna go into the wilderness, and I'm gonna make a new life for myself among the tree people. It can't be worse than this.
2;6;The Ricks Must Be Crazy;Rick;Sure. Okay, Morty. Just be back before sundown or the tree people will eat you.
2;6;The Ricks Must Be Crazy;Morty;That's a myth! W-w-why are you trying to start a myth?
2;6;The Ricks Must Be Crazy;Rick;It's a prehistoric planet, Morty. Someone has to bring a little culture. And it certainly can't be someone whose entire culture powers my brake lights!
2;6;The Ricks Must Be Crazy;Army General;Go, go, go!
2;6;The Ricks Must Be Crazy;Summer;Oh, my God. Oh, God. What are we going to do now?
2;6;The Ricks Must Be Crazy;Ship;I am unable to destroy this army. To clarify, I am quite able to destroy this army, but you will not permit it.
2;6;The Ricks Must Be Crazy;Summer;Correct.
2;6;The Ricks Must Be Crazy;Ship;You also refuse to authorize emotional countermeasures.
2;6;The Ricks Must Be Crazy;Summer;If you're talking about the melting ghost babies, yes, please, no more of that.
2;6;The Ricks Must Be Crazy;Ship; Confirmed. I am currently constructing a security measure in compliance with your parameters. But I do want to say you are not making this easy.
2;6;The Ricks Must Be Crazy;Summer;You know you're kind of a dick, right?
2;6;The Ricks Must Be Crazy;Ship;My function is to keep Summer safe, not keep Summer being, like, totally stoked about, like, the general vibe and stuff. That's you. That's how you talk.
2;6;The Ricks Must Be Crazy;Rick;Hey, that's my deer!
2;6;The Ricks Must Be Crazy;Zeep;Aaaaaaah!
2;6;The Ricks Must Be Crazy;Rick;Raah!
2;6;The Ricks Must Be Crazy;Zeep;I hope your God is as big a dick as you.
2;6;The Ricks Must Be Crazy;Rick;My God's the biggest dick that's never existed. Why do you think I'm even here?
2;6;The Ricks Must Be Crazy;Zeep;You're here because you created someone smarter than you.
2;6;The Ricks Must Be Crazy;Rick;Oh, I thought we were both here because I created a universe of idiots.
2;6;The Ricks Must Be Crazy;Morty;Kalo kada sha la.
2;6;The Ricks Must Be Crazy;Rick;Holy shit. Morty? I haven't seen you in months. You're leading the tree people? Huh. That's a step up.
2;6;The Ricks Must Be Crazy;Morty;We have no leaders. We follow only the will of the forest.
2;6;The Ricks Must Be Crazy;Rick;Ooh. Wow. Gaaaaay.
2;6;The Ricks Must Be Crazy;Zeep;That is pretty gay.
2;6;The Ricks Must Be Crazy;Morty;You two call yourselves geniuses, but you have spent this time learning nothing. Come with me into the forest. There is something I wish to teach you.
2;6;The Ricks Must Be Crazy;Morty;This is Ku'ala, the spirit tree. For generations, it has guided the-- You have to get us the fuck out of here. These people are backwards savages. They eat every third baby because they think it makes fruit grow bigger. Everyone's gross, and they all smell like piss all the time. I m-- I miss my family. I miss my laptop. I masturbated to an extra-curvy piece of driftwood the other day!
2;6;The Ricks Must Be Crazy;Morty;Look, I don't care what it takes. You two are putting aside your bullshit, and you're working together to get us back home.
2;6;The Ricks Must Be Crazy;Rick;No can do, Morty. I just can't.
2;6;The Ricks Must Be Crazy;Zeep;I just don't see how I can--
2;6;The Ricks Must Be Crazy;Morty;Ro ro dah no gah! You're smart. You'll figure it out.
2;6;The Ricks Must Be Crazy;Army General;You have 10 seconds to get out of the ship! 10, 9...
2;6;The Ricks Must Be Crazy;Rick;All right, not bad.
2;6;The Ricks Must Be Crazy;Zeep;I guess you're an okay proto recombinator.
2;6;The Ricks Must Be Crazy;Rick;I've certainly seen worse ionic cell dioxination.
2;6;The Ricks Must Be Crazy;Zeep;If this works, drinks are on me.
2;6;The Ricks Must Be Crazy;Rick;If drinks are on you, you're gonna need a second mortgage on that tower. I'm an alcoholic.
2;6;The Ricks Must Be Crazy;Zeep;Opium addict.
2;6;The Ricks Must Be Crazy;Morty;All right, okay, okay, okay, wrap it up. You guys are the fucking worst! Your gods are a lie! Fuck you, fuck nature, and fuck trees!
2;6;The Ricks Must Be Crazy;Morty;Yes! You did it! Yes!
2;6;The Ricks Must Be Crazy;Rick;Hey, uh, how about that drink?
2;6;The Ricks Must Be Crazy;Zeep;Sure, I just need to go grab my wallet from inside my ship.
2;6;The Ricks Must Be Crazy;Rick;Is our wallet in your ship? That's where the transporter is, too, so why don't we come with?
2;6;The Ricks Must Be Crazy;Zeep;It's cool. I'll be back in a sec.
2;6;The Ricks Must Be Crazy;Rick;You know how long a second can take in a microverse?
2;6;The Ricks Must Be Crazy;Rick;Oh! Run, Morty! That asshole's willing to risk everything he cares about just to defeat me! He's psychotic!
2;6;The Ricks Must Be Crazy;Rick;Morty, hop on my back.
2;6;The Ricks Must Be Crazy;Morty;Why?
2;6;The Ricks Must Be Crazy;Rick;Go, go  Sanchez ski shoes.
2;6;The Ricks Must Be Crazy;Morty;Aaaaaah!
2;6;The Ricks Must Be Crazy;Army General;...Eight...
2;6;The Ricks Must Be Crazy;Morty;Aaaah! 
2;6;The Ricks Must Be Crazy;Rick;Oof!
2;6;The Ricks Must Be Crazy;Rick;Hold still. 
2;6;The Ricks Must Be Crazy;Mr. President;Oh, hey, guys. I just finished cooking us a feast.
2;6;The Ricks Must Be Crazy;Rick;Aaaah! Holy--
2;6;The Ricks Must Be Crazy;Zeep;You monster!
2;6;The Ricks Must Be Crazy;Mr. President;Whoa. Bad tour.
2;6;The Ricks Must Be Crazy;Army General;...seven...
2;6;The Ricks Must Be Crazy;Secretary;Hey, you got to sign out. 
2;6;The Ricks Must Be Crazy;Rick;Nothing you do matters! Your existence is a lie!
2;6;The Ricks Must Be Crazy;Secretary;If that were really true, then...
2;6;The Ricks Must Be Crazy;Female Visitor;I'm here to see Ron Mendleson.
2;6;The Ricks Must Be Crazy;Secretary;Third floor. Would you like to go to dinner with--
2;6;The Ricks Must Be Crazy;Female Visitor;Uh, no.
2;6;The Ricks Must Be Crazy;Zeep;You may have created this universe, Rick, but I live in it.
2;6;The Ricks Must Be Crazy;Morty;What are we gonna do, Rick? We're so screwed. He's gonna get to the ship and smash the microverse, and then he's gonna kill us! 
2;6;The Ricks Must Be Crazy;Rick;Quick, Morty, you've got to turn into a car.
2;6;The Ricks Must Be Crazy;Morty;What?!
2;6;The Ricks Must Be Crazy;Rick;A long time ago, I implanted you with a subdermal chip that could call upon dormant nanobots in your bloodstream to restructure your anatomy and turn you into a car.
2;6;The Ricks Must Be Crazy;Morty;Oh, my God!
2;6;The Ricks Must Be Crazy;Rick;Concentrate, Morty. Concentrate and turn into a car, Morty.
2;6;The Ricks Must Be Crazy;Rick;Never mind. Here's a taxi. Get in. It's fine.
2;6;The Ricks Must Be Crazy;Army General;...six...
2;6;The Ricks Must Be Crazy;Rick;Hey, Zeep.
2;6;The Ricks Must Be Crazy;Zeep;Huh?
2;6;The Ricks Must Be Crazy;Rick;Happy Ricksgiving, biiiiiitch.
2;6;The Ricks Must Be Crazy;Zeep;Aaah!
2;6;The Ricks Must Be Crazy;Rick;We did it, Morty. Now let's get out of here and destroy this whole universe.
2;6;The Ricks Must Be Crazy;Taxi Driver;Excuse me?
2;6;The Ricks Must Be Crazy;Army General;...five--
2;6;The Ricks Must Be Crazy;Soldier;Sir?
2;6;The Ricks Must Be Crazy;Army General;Holy hell.
2;6;The Ricks Must Be Crazy;Soldier;Sir!
2;6;The Ricks Must Be Crazy;Human President;Hold you fire!
2;6;The Ricks Must Be Crazy;Summer;What's going on?
2;6;The Ricks Must Be Crazy;Ship;I have brokered a peace agreement between the giant spiders and the government.
2;6;The Ricks Must Be Crazy;Human President;Thanks to the skilled diplomacy of this mysterious space car, from this day forward, human- and spiderkind will live side by side in peace. We will stop bombing them, and they will no longer use their telepathic abilities to make us wander into webs for later consumption. Instead, we will work together to make this world a better place for all, no matter how many legs.
2;6;The Ricks Must Be Crazy;Soldier;What do we do about the space car?
2;6;The Ricks Must Be Crazy;Human President;Leave it alone. I mean, what did it really do, anyways? Kill a guy and paralyze his buddy?  Not a bad trade for spider peace. 
2;6;The Ricks Must Be Crazy;Army General;.All right, that's it. Move out!
2;6;The Ricks Must Be Crazy;Human President; I love this spider!
2;6;The Ricks Must Be Crazy;Ship;Summer is safe.
2;6;The Ricks Must Be Crazy;Summer;All right, I get it.
2;6;The Ricks Must Be Crazy;Zeep;Rick!
2;6;The Ricks Must Be Crazy;Morty;Don't do it.
2;6;The Ricks Must Be Crazy;Rick;You quit school, but you still got some learning to do. 
2;6;The Ricks Must Be Crazy;Zeep;Aah!
2;6;The Ricks Must Be Crazy;Rick;Unh!
2;6;The Ricks Must Be Crazy;Rick;Class dismissed.
2;6;The Ricks Must Be Crazy;Morty;Geez.
2;6;The Ricks Must Be Crazy;Rick;You all right?
2;6;The Ricks Must Be Crazy;Summer;Uh-huh!
2;6;The Ricks Must Be Crazy;Morty;What are you doing, Rick? I'm pretty sure the battery's dead.
2;6;The Ricks Must Be Crazy;Rick;Oh, you think so, huh, Morty? Well, let's see.
2;6;The Ricks Must Be Crazy;Morty;Hey, wait-- huh? I don't get it.
2;6;The Ricks Must Be Crazy;Rick;Of course you don't. But Zeep did. He knew that once I got back to my car, one of two things was gonna happen-- I was gonna have to toss a broken battery, or the battery wouldn't be broken. 
2;6;The Ricks Must Be Crazy;Zeep;Peace among worlds, Rick.
2;6;The Ricks Must Be Crazy;Morty;Jesus.
2;6;The Ricks Must Be Crazy;Rick;Yeah. Listen to that baby purr. You were right, Morty-- We really just needed to be honest with those guys. All right, here we go.
2;6;The Ricks Must Be Crazy;Rick;Thank y-o-o-ou. See, Morty? This is what it's all about.This is why we do what we do.
2;6;The Ricks Must Be Crazy;Morty;Uh-huh.
2;6;The Ricks Must Be Crazy;Rick;Ew! What the hell? Jesus! There's flies in my ice cream.
2;6;The Ricks Must Be Crazy;Ice cream clerk;Presidential decree-- All ice cream is now for all beings, no matter how many legs.
2;6;The Ricks Must Be Crazy;Rick;What the fuck did you do, Summer?!
2;6;The Ricks Must Be Crazy;Summer;It was your ship! Your stupid ship did it!
2;6;The Ricks Must Be Crazy;Rick;Don't blame my ship!
2;6;The Ricks Must Be Crazy;Summer;It melted a child!
2;6;The Ricks Must Be Crazy;Rick;My ship doesn't do anything...
2;6;The Ricks Must Be Crazy;Summer;It killed it itself!
2;6;The Ricks Must Be Crazy;Rick;...unless it's told to do something!
2;6;The Ricks Must Be Crazy;Summer;We almost died!
2;6;The Ricks Must Be Crazy;Rick;I don't want to hear it, Summer!
2;6;The Ricks Must Be Crazy;Rick;Your boobs are all hanging about, and you ruined ice cream with your boobs out. And don't even try to deny it, either.
2;7;Big Trouble In Little Sanchez;Jerry;What’s new at school?
2;7;Big Trouble In Little Sanchez;Summer;Nothing.
2;7;Big Trouble In Little Sanchez;Morty;Nothing! Oh, uh, one of the lunch ladies died. They found her in the gym with, like, two holes in her neck and all the blood drained out of her.
2;7;Big Trouble In Little Sanchez;Beth;Good lord! Who does something like that?
2;7;Big Trouble In Little Sanchez;Rick;Obviously a vampire. W-w-where’s the pepper?
2;7;Big Trouble In Little Sanchez;Summer;Wait, what?! Vampires are real?!
2;7;Big Trouble In Little Sanchez;Jerry;Yes, Summer, vampires are real. Who knew?
2;7;Big Trouble In Little Sanchez;Rick;Oh, right, all humanity, for hundreds of years, now.
2;7;Big Trouble In Little Sanchez;Morty;Yeah, Summer, it’s a big universe.
2;7;Big Trouble In Little Sanchez;Morty;Get used to it. R-right, Rick?
2;7;Big Trouble In Little Sanchez;Summer;Well, what are we going to do?!
2;7;Big Trouble In Little Sanchez;Rick;We’re gonna live our lives until we die. Possibly by vampire. More likely auto accident or heart disease, but possibly vampire.
2;7;Big Trouble In Little Sanchez;Summer;Grandpa Rick, couldn’t you, like, use your superknowledge to turn yourself into a teenager and come to our school and help us hunt the vampire down?
2;7;Big Trouble In Little Sanchez;Morty;Um -- wow.
2;7;Big Trouble In Little Sanchez;Rick;Yeah, pretty specific pitch, Summer. I probably could turn myself into a teenager and hang out in the zit-covered, hormone-addled, low-stakes assworld that is high school. But here’s my reverse-ask -- why in the  would I ever do that, ever? And how dare you even ask me that And why aren’t you more ashamed of yourself?
2;7;Big Trouble In Little Sanchez;Summer;Dad!
2;7;Big Trouble In Little Sanchez;Jerry;Be ashamed of yourself, sweetie.
2;7;Big Trouble In Little Sanchez;Beth;Jerry! Do you know what you just said to our daughter?
2;7;Big Trouble In Little Sanchez;Jerry;Sor-ry! I wasn’t paying attention.
2;7;Big Trouble In Little Sanchez;Beth;To a conversation about vampires?!
2;7;Big Trouble In Little Sanchez;Jerry;Clearly, I didn’t know it was about vampires, because I wasn’t paying attention, which you would know, if you ever paid attention to me!
2;7;Big Trouble In Little Sanchez;Beth;Oh, here we go, right to the victim role.
2;7;Big Trouble In Little Sanchez;Jerry;Am I a victim, Beth, or am I married to a mean, unfair monster that always hurts me?!
2;7;Big Trouble In Little Sanchez;Rick;Jesus Christ! Will you fix your marriage or get a divorce already?
2;7;Big Trouble In Little Sanchez;Jerry;Well, we tried a couples’ therapist.
2;7;Big Trouble In Little Sanchez;Rick;That’s earth therapy. You might as well ask a horse to fix a merry-go-round. I mean, he’ll try his best, but mostly, he’s just gonna get horrified. I know about a place off-planet with a 100% success rate.
2;7;Big Trouble In Little Sanchez;Beth;Well, we want to make it work, if we can.
2;7;Big Trouble In Little Sanchez;Jerry;It’s just -- then it’s settled.
2;7;Big Trouble In Little Sanchez;Rick;No need to pack.
2;7;Big Trouble In Little Sanchez;Jerry;Oh!
2;7;Big Trouble In Little Sanchez;Rick;Let’s go, go, go, go!
2;7;Big Trouble In Little Sanchez;Morty;Do you think mom and dad are, you know, gonna get a divorce?
2;7;Big Trouble In Little Sanchez;Summer;I think it’s okay to dream, Morty. I’m gonna go make some wooden stakes.
2;7;Big Trouble In Little Sanchez;Rick;I BOOKED YOU FOR A TWO-DAY INTENSIVE AT NUPTIA FOUR, THE GALAXY’S MOST SUCCESSFUL COUPLES’ COUNSELING INSTITUTE. THEY COULD SAVE THE MARRIAGE OF A DOG AND A BAR OF DARK CHOCOLATE. THEY COULD SAVE THE MARRIAGE OF A P0RN STAR AND A P0RN STAR.
2;7;Big Trouble In Little Sanchez;Jerry;WELL, I KNOW I’M READY TO TRY WHATEVER IT TAKES.
2;7;Big Trouble In Little Sanchez;Beth;WHICH CLEARLY IMPLIES THAT I’M NOT.
2;7;Big Trouble In Little Sanchez;Jerry;IT’S NOT A COMPETITION, BETH.
2;7;Big Trouble In Little Sanchez;Beth;OH IS THAT HOW YOU’RE GONNA TRY TO WIN, BY IMPLYING I’M COMPETITIVE?
2;7;Big Trouble In Little Sanchez;Jerry;IF THE SHOE FITS.
2;7;Big Trouble In Little Sanchez;Beth;MY SHOE FITS UP YOUR ASS.
2;7;Big Trouble In Little Sanchez;Jerry;YOU WISH!
2;7;Big Trouble In Little Sanchez;Rick;OKAY, HAVE FUN. SEE YA THURSDAY!
2;7;Big Trouble In Little Sanchez;Beth;OH!
2;7;Big Trouble In Little Sanchez;Jerry;JERK.
2;7;Big Trouble In Little Sanchez;Beth;DON’T INSULT MY FATHER. HE’S THE REASON OUR KIDS ARE ONLY HALF-STUPID.
2;7;Big Trouble In Little Sanchez;Jerry;HA! YOU JUST CALLED YOURSELF -- OH.
2;7;Big Trouble In Little Sanchez;Glaxo Slimslom;BETH AND JERRY SMITH?
2;7;Big Trouble In Little Sanchez;Jerry;YES.
2;7;Big Trouble In Little Sanchez;Glaxo Slimslom;I’M GLAXO SLIMSLOM. WELCOME TO NUPTIA FOUR. YOUR MARRIAGE CAN REST EASY NOW. JERRY, GO AHEAD AND SIT THERE AND PUT THIS ON. THIS MACHINE ISOLATES THE PART OF THE SUBJECT’S BRAIN CONTAINING ALL PERCEPTIONS OF ITS ROMANTIC PARTNER. AND WE WILL NOW RENDER JERRY’S PERCEPTION OF BETH WITH ARTIFICIAL BIOLOGICAL LIFE.  INTERESTING.
2;7;Big Trouble In Little Sanchez;Beth;WHAT THE HELL IS THAT?! TAKE THAT BACK! YOU DO NOT THINK THAT ABOUT ME!
2;7;Big Trouble In Little Sanchez;Jerry;I DIDN’T DO ANYTHING! THEY SCANNED IT OUT OF MY BRAIN. CAN I TAKE IT BACK?
2;7;Big Trouble In Little Sanchez;Glaxo Slimslom;THERE’S NOTHING TO REGRET. WE’RE DEALING WITH UNCONSCIOUS, UNHEALTHY THOUGHTS. BETH. NOW, WE SCAN FOR BETH’S PERCEPTIONS OF JERRY.
2;7;Big Trouble In Little Sanchez;Beth;SCAN HARD. HE’S DEAD TO ME.
2;7;Big Trouble In Little Sanchez;Jerry;EVERYTHING’S DEAD TO YOU.
2;7;Big Trouble In Little Sanchez;Beth;WHAT?
2;7;Big Trouble In Little Sanchez;Jerry;NOTHING. 
2;7;Big Trouble In Little Sanchez;Beth;READ IT AND WEEP, BITCH.
2;7;Big Trouble In Little Sanchez;Jerry; DOES EVERYBODY SEE WHAT I MEAN?
2;7;Big Trouble In Little Sanchez;Glaxo Slimslom;I THINK WE ALL SEE WHAT YOU BOTH MEAN.
2;7;Big Trouble In Little Sanchez;Summer;ANY LEADS ON THE VAMPIRE?
2;7;Big Trouble In Little Sanchez;Morty;NO, SUMMER! I MEAN, YOU KNOW, I THINK IT MIGHT BE TIME THAT WE JUST L-LET IT GO.
2;7;Big Trouble In Little Sanchez;Summer;OH, SO, NOW, YOU’RE TOO COOL FOR THIS, JUST BECAUSE GRANDPA RICK IS?
2;7;Big Trouble In Little Sanchez;Morty;IT’S NOT THAT, IT’S JUST THAT THE UNIVERSE IS A LITTLE TOO BIG TO CARE ABOUT SOMETHING SO SMALL.
2;7;Big Trouble In Little Sanchez;Summer;AAH!
2;7;Big Trouble In Little Sanchez;Tiny Rick;WHAT UP, MY HELSINGS? WHO WANTS TO HUNT A VAMPIRE? HA HA HA!
2;7;Big Trouble In Little Sanchez;Morty;RICK? HOW -- HOW DID YOU --
2;7;Big Trouble In Little Sanchez;Tiny Rick;YEAH, I GOT BORED AND THEN, I REMEMBERED, THIS MORNING, HOW I BLEW SUMMER OFF, AND I THOUGHT, HEY
2;7;Big Trouble In Little Sanchez;Morty;O-O-OKAY.
2;7;Big Trouble In Little Sanchez;Summer;WELL, IT’S GOOD YOU’RE HERE, RICK. I WAS PRETTY SURE WE DIDN’T HAVE WHAT IT TAKES TO DEAL WITH A BLOODSUCKER ON OUR OWN.
2;7;Big Trouble In Little Sanchez;Tiny Rick;DON’T SHORT-SELL YOURSELF, SUMMER. YOU GOT EVERYTHING IT TAKES. BUT IT’LL STILL BE FUN TO DO THIS AS A  TEAM, MOTHER TINY RICK!
2;7;Big Trouble In Little Sanchez;Summer;YEAH! OH, MY GOD, TOBY MATTHEWS!
2;7;Big Trouble In Little Sanchez;Tiny Rick;HEY, TOBY. I’M TINY RICK. I’M NEW. HEY OH -- GO EASY ON ME. HA HA. JUST KIDDIN’.
2;7;Big Trouble In Little Sanchez;Toby;I LIKE YOUR STRAIGHTFORWARD STYLE AND THAT LAB COAT’S PRETTY COOL. SUMMER.
2;7;Big Trouble In Little Sanchez;Summer;HE KNOWS MY NAME!
2;7;Big Trouble In Little Sanchez;Tiny Rick;WHY WOULDN’T HE? YOU’RE GREAT! BUT, LISTEN, JUST BE CAREFUL. WE CAN’T RULE ANYBODY OUT AS THE VAMPIRE, NOT EVEN THE DREAMBOATS. STOP, TINY RICK. HUNTIN’ A VAMPIRE WITH MY GRANDKIDS! ! TINY RI-I-CK!
2;7;Big Trouble In Little Sanchez;Glaxo Slimslom;THE NEXT STEP IS TO WATCH YOUR MYTHOLOGUES INTERACT TOGETHER AND, UH -- BIG SURPRISE -- IT’S NEVER PRETTY.  HERE WE HAVE GARRRH AND ZHARBIDAR GLOOMPFSCHS, OR, SHOULD I SAY, HERE WE HAVE THE WAY GARRRH AND ZHARBIDAR PERCEIVE EACH OTHER.   AS WE CAN ALL SEE, THIS IS HARDLY THE REAL GARRRH AND ZHARBIDAR. WHICH IS GOOD, BECAUSE THE RELATIONSHIP IN THEIR HEADS IS NOT ONLY UGLY, IT’S UNSUSTAINABLE.    YOU MAY ALREADY BE LEARNING SOMETHING IMPORTANT -- ALL OF THESE RELATIONSHIPS ARE DIFFERENT, NONE OF THEM ARE REAL, AND NONE OF THEM WORK. WE ARE NOT THE MONSTERS WE SOMETIMES SEE EACH OTHER AS, BECAUSE WE ARE REAL AND WE ARE FUNCTIONAL. THAT’S WHAT MAKES US BETTER THAN THEM WE CAN FIND SOLUTIONS. WE CAN ADAPT. WE CAN COMMUNICATE.  AND, MOST IMPORTANTLY, WE CAN WORK TOGETHER.
2;7;Big Trouble In Little Sanchez;Morty;WELL, IT WAS A TOUGH ADVENTURE, BUT IT PAID OFF -- OUR SCHOOL IS VAMPIRE-FREE!
2;7;Big Trouble In Little Sanchez;Tiny Rick;MAN, WHO WOULD’VE SUSPECTED COACH FERATU? YOU DID GREAT, GUYS. COULDN’T HAVE DONE IT WITHOUT YA. YOU KNOW, WE -- W-WE SHOULD BE PROUD OF OURSELVES. WE KILLED A VAMPIRE AND A GYM TEACHER. HA HA HA. TALK ABOUT TWO-FOR-ONE, RIGHT?!
2;7;Big Trouble In Little Sanchez;Summer;SO, HOW, EXACTLY, IS YOUR OLD BODY LIVING IN THERE, GRANDPA RICK?
2;7;Big Trouble In Little Sanchez;Rick;OH, YOU KNOW, HYPERBARIC QUANTUM FLUID,  THAT KIND OF THING. IT PRESERVES LIVING TISSUE. NOT THAT THERE WAS MUCH TO PRESERVE. LOOK AT THAT MUMMY! HA! HA HA! AND I GUESS IT’S TIME FOR ME TO GET BACK INSIDE THE OLD-TIMER.
2;7;Big Trouble In Little Sanchez;Summer;OH, MY GOD. TOBY MATTHEWS IS ASKING IF MY PARENTS ARE STILL OUT OF TOWN AND IF WE CAN HAVE A PARTY!
2;7;Big Trouble In Little Sanchez;Tiny Rick;ALL RIGHT, WAY TO GO, SUMMER! WHAT DID I TELL YOU?
2;7;Big Trouble In Little Sanchez;Summer;OHH! HE’S ASKING IF TINY RICK WILL BE HERE.
2;7;Big Trouble In Little Sanchez;Tiny Rick;WELL, YOU KNOW WHAT, SUMMER? TELL HIM TINY RICK WILL BE HERE! AND TELL HIM TO BRING SOME BREWS!
2;7;Big Trouble In Little Sanchez;Morty;FOR REAL? Y-Y-Y-YOU WOULD STAY AS TINY RICK, JUST SO WE CAN HAVE A PARTY?
2;7;Big Trouble In Little Sanchez;Tiny Rick;HELL, YEAH! WHAT’S ONE MORE NIGHT? AND WHO CAN HAVE FUN WITH THIS OLD BRD HANGING AROUND, HUH? WUBBY LUBBY DOOB DOOB! WHOO! TINY RICK!
2;7;Big Trouble In Little Sanchez;Glaxo Slimslom;MOVING ON. NOW, WE HAVE BETH AND JERRY SMITH FROM THE PLANET E-ARTH.
2;7;Big Trouble In Little Sanchez;Beth;MY HEART IS POUNDING.
2;7;Big Trouble In Little Sanchez;Jerry;THIS IS GONNA BE GREAT.
2;7;Big Trouble In Little Sanchez;Glaxo Slimslom;THE E-ARTH RELATIONSHIPS ARE SIMPLER. IT’S A PRIMITIVE PLANET, SO THEIR DYSFUNCTIONS ARE OH -- W-WAIT, WHAT? WHAT’S GOING ON? WHERE ARE THE SMITH MYTHOLOGUES?
2;7;Big Trouble In Little Sanchez;Jerry;OH, MY GOD.
2;7;Big Trouble In Little Sanchez;Glaxo Slimslom; AAH! AAH! OH, MY GOD. SECURE THE CELL! AAAAH!  UH, HEY! YOU KNOW WHAT’S FUN? OUR GIFT SHOP. WHY DON’T WE PROCEED IN AN ORDERLY --   OH, DEAR GOD, NO. THEY’RE CODEPENDENT! RUN!  OH!
2;7;Big Trouble In Little Sanchez;Jessica;HEY, MORTY.
2;7;Big Trouble In Little Sanchez;Morty;OH, HEY -- HEY, JESSICA.
2;7;Big Trouble In Little Sanchez;Jessica;SO, IS TINY RICK YOUR BROTHER OR COUSIN, OR...?
2;7;Big Trouble In Little Sanchez;Morty;NO, MY GRANDPA JUST TRANSFERRED HIS CONSCIOUSNESS INTO A CLONE OF HIMSELF SO HE COULD BE IN OUR HIGH SCHOOL.
2;7;Big Trouble In Little Sanchez;Jessica;COOL.
2;7;Big Trouble In Little Sanchez;Toby;HEY, TINY RICK’S PLAYING GUITAR.
2;7;Big Trouble In Little Sanchez;Rick;ALL RIGHT, EVERYBODY. THIS NEXT ONE’S COMING STRAIGHT FROM THE HEART. MAKING THE LYRICS UP RIGHT OFF THE TOP OF MY HEAD.             TINY RICK! THANKS, EVERYBODY!
2;7;Big Trouble In Little Sanchez;Party-goer;THIS GUY’S AMAZING!
2;7;Big Trouble In Little Sanchez;Morty;I LOVE TINY RICK!
2;7;Big Trouble In Little Sanchez;Party-goer;BAD. ASS.
2;7;Big Trouble In Little Sanchez;Party-goer;YEAH!
2;7;Big Trouble In Little Sanchez;Glaxo Slimslom;WHAT THE ?
2;7;Big Trouble In Little Sanchez;Jerry;YEAH, I KNOW! WHAT KIND OF OPERATION ARE YOU RUNNING?
2;7;Big Trouble In Little Sanchez;Glaxo Slimslom;US?! WHAT THE HELL KIND OF RELATIONSHIP DO YOU HAVE?!
2;7;Big Trouble In Little Sanchez;Beth;OH, RIGHT, BLAME THIS ON US.
2;7;Big Trouble In Little Sanchez;Glaxo Slimslom;OKAY, UH, I CAN AND I AM! YOUR DEMONIZED MYTHOLOGIZATIONS OF EACH OTHER ARE COOPERATING.
2;7;Big Trouble In Little Sanchez;Jerry;ISN’T THAT GOOD?
2;7;Big Trouble In Little Sanchez;Glaxo Slimslom;NO. NO! IT’S BAD! YOU HAVE THE SINGLE WORST MARRIAGE I’VE EVER WITNESSED. IT SHOULDN’T EXIST! YOU SHOULD NEVER, EVER, EVER, HAVE GOTTEN TOGETHER AND I DO NOT UNDERSTAND HOW, OR WHY, YOU WOULD EVER STAY TOGETHER.
2;7;Big Trouble In Little Sanchez;Beth;WELL, THIS IS JUST BAD COUPLES’ THERAPY.
2;7;Big Trouble In Little Sanchez;Jerry;TOTALLY.
2;7;Big Trouble In Little Sanchez;Jerry;BETH! YOU’LL WANT TO SEE THIS.
2;7;Big Trouble In Little Sanchez;Beth;WHAT IS IT?
2;7;Big Trouble In Little Sanchez;Jerry;IT’S A SMALL, HINGED PANEL WITH A TINY AMOUNT OF SPACE BEHIND IT. IF YOU CAN FIND ONE, TOO, WE SHOULD BE SAFE FOR HOURS, MAYBE DAYS!
2;7;Big Trouble In Little Sanchez;Beth;YOU STAY PUT, JERRY. I’LL SEND HELP, IF I MAKE IT.
2;7;Big Trouble In Little Sanchez;Jerry;YOU DON’T WANT TO FIND YOUR OWN LITTLE HATCH?
2;7;Big Trouble In Little Sanchez;Beth;JERRY, I BELIEVE THAT, IF YOU HIDE BY YOURSELF, YOU MIGHT SURVIVE AND I BELIEVE I, BY MYSELF, HAVE A SHOT OF GETTING OUT OF HERE, BUT THE TWO OF US, TOGETHER? I DON’T KNOW. LOOK, MAYBE THE SHRINK WAS RIGHT. GOOD LUCK.  ALL RIGHT, NOW, YOU LISTEN TO ME. OH! OR DON’T.
2;7;Big Trouble In Little Sanchez;Jerry;HEY! DON’T! PLEASE!
2;7;Big Trouble In Little Sanchez;Jerry;OH, GOD, OH, GOD, OH, GOD!
2;7;Big Trouble In Little Sanchez;Mr. Goldenfold;NOW, I KNOW I’VE SAID, IN THE PAST, THAT MATH IS IMPORTANT -- AND IT IS! -- BUT I ALSO THINK THAT, ONE DAY, YOU’LL ALL LOOK BACK ON BEING IN HIGH SCHOOL WITH TINY RICK AND MORTY, WHO I HEAR HAD A GREAT PARTY LAST NIGHT. SO, CLASS DISMISSED. YOU’VE GOT THE DAY OFF!
2;7;Big Trouble In Little Sanchez;Tiny Rick;ALL RIGHT! GOOD WORK, MR. GOLDENFOLD!
2;7;Big Trouble In Little Sanchez;Mr. Goldenfold;YEAH, GET OUTSIDE. READ A BOOK. PUT ON SOME SUNSCREEN, DANIELLE!
2;7;Big Trouble In Little Sanchez;Tiny Rick;HEY, WHAT’S UP, SUMMER? OOH, NICE TOP.
2;7;Big Trouble In Little Sanchez;Summer;THANKS. TINY RICK, YOU THINK YOU MIGHT BE GETTING BACK INTO YOUR OLD BODY TONIGHT?
2;7;Big Trouble In Little Sanchez;Tiny Rick;NO CAN DO. TONIGHT’S THE BIG DANCE AND MORTY’S BRINGING JESSICA. HE NEEDS HIS TINY WING MAN.
2;7;Big Trouble In Little Sanchez;Both;TINY RICK! 
2;7;Big Trouble In Little Sanchez;Summer;OKAY, BUT IF NOT TONIGHT, WHEN?
2;7;Big Trouble In Little Sanchez;Tiny Rick;I DON’T KNOW. WHEN I FEEL LIKE IT? DAMN, GIRL! YOU NEED TO CHILL OUT!
2;7;Big Trouble In Little Sanchez;Morty;THIS WHOLE THING WAS YOUR IDEA, IN THE FIRST PLACE, AND, NOW, YOU’RE TRYING TO RUSH IT ALONG.
2;7;Big Trouble In Little Sanchez;Tiny Rick;YEAH, AND YOU KNOW WHAT? I LIKE HIGH SCHOOL. I LIKE HANGING OUT. TINY RICK!
2;7;Big Trouble In Little Sanchez;Summer;BUT WHAT IF THE YOU THAT LIKES IT ISN’T YOU?
2;7;Big Trouble In Little Sanchez;Both;OH!
2;7;Big Trouble In Little Sanchez;Both;OH, SUMMER!
2;7;Big Trouble In Little Sanchez;Morty;IT’S JUST RICK IN A YOUNGER BODY. WHAT’S THE -- WHAT’S -- WHAT’S -- WHAT’S -- WHAT’S THE -- WHAT’S THE PROBLEM?
2;7;Big Trouble In Little Sanchez;Summer;LOOK AT HIS ART, MORTY.
2;7;Big Trouble In Little Sanchez;Tiny Rick;I’VE GOT AN EMO STREAK. IT’S PART OF WHAT MAKES ME SO RAD.
2;7;Big Trouble In Little Sanchez;Summer;"WHY DOES IT SAY HELP ME MORTY AND SUMMER!""?"""
2;7;Big Trouble In Little Sanchez;Morty;COME ON, SUMMER, THAT’S THE TITLE OF THE ART. WHY WAS KNIGHT RIDER CALLED KNIGHT RIDER?
2;7;Big Trouble In Little Sanchez;Tiny Rick;THE CAR’S NAME WAS KITT. NOBODY RODE MICHAEL KNIGHT. YOU’RE OVERTHINKING IT, SUMMER. I’M TINY RICK!
2;7;Big Trouble In Little Sanchez;Summer;GRANDPA, I THINK THAT, WHEN YOU PUT YOUR MIND INTO THIS BODY’S YOUNG BRAIN, IT DID WHAT YOUNG BRAINS DO -- IT SHOVED THE BAD THOUGHTS INTO THE BACK AND PUT A WALL AROUND THEM. BUT THOSE BAD THOUGHTS ARE THE REAL RICK. THE FACT THAT YOU’RE OLD, THE FACT THAT WE’RE ALL GOING TO DIE, ONE DAY, THE FACT THAT THE UNIVERSE IS SO BIG, NOTHING IN IT MATTERS, THOSE FACTS ARE WHO YOU ARE. SO YOU’RE TRAPPED IN THERE AND YOU CAN ONLY COME OUT IN THE FORM OF TINY RICK’S TEEN ANGST!
2;7;Big Trouble In Little Sanchez;Tiny Rick;WELL, SUMMER, I HEAR TOBY MATTHEWS ISN’T INTO PSYCHO CHICKS. CAN’T THINK OF ANYONE THAT IS. I’LL SEE YOU MOTHER AT THE DANCE! TINY RICK!
2;7;Big Trouble In Little Sanchez;Summer;MORTY, YOU HAVE TO HELP ME!
2;7;Big Trouble In Little Sanchez;Morty;SUMMER, HE’S HAPPY! I’M HAPPY! I-I-IS THAT WHY YOU’RE DOING THIS, YOU DON’T WANT ME AND RICK TO BE HAPPY?
2;7;Big Trouble In Little Sanchez;Summer;NO.
2;7;Big Trouble In Little Sanchez;Morty;WELL, THEN GET YOUR SH1T TOGETHER! GET IT ALL TOGETHER AND PUT IT IN A BACKPACK. ALL YOUR SH1T, SO IT’S TOGETHER. AND IF YOU GOTTA TAKE IT SOMEWHERE, TAKE IT SOMEWHERE, YOU KNOW? TAKE IT TO THE SH1T STORE AND SELL IT O-OR PUT IT IN A SH1T MUSEUM. I DON’T CARE WHAT YOU DO! YOU JUST GOTTA GET IT TOGETHER. GET YOUR SH1T TOGETHER.
2;7;Big Trouble In Little Sanchez;Jerry;  GET BACK!  WAIT, FOR REAL?  YOU’RE HOW BETH SEES ME? OH, MY GOD. TURN AROUND!I SAID TURN AROUND! HOW CAN BETH HAVE THESE THOUGHTS ABOUT ME?! THAT JUDGMENTAL MONSTER BITCH! I’M NOT TAKING THIS. I WANT TO KNOW WHERE MY WIFE IS. YOU ARE GOING TO HELP ME. NO! NOBODY’S DOING THAT!
2;7;Big Trouble In Little Sanchez;Beth Monster;STAY.
2;7;Big Trouble In Little Sanchez;Beth;WHAT DO YOU WANT?
2;7;Big Trouble In Little Sanchez;Beth Monster;JERRYS.
2;7;Big Trouble In Little Sanchez;Beth;YOU WANT JERRY? I DON’T EVEN WANT JERRY.
2;7;Big Trouble In Little Sanchez;Beth Monster;I WANT JERRYS. WAAHEE! AN ARMY.
2;7;Big Trouble In Little Sanchez;Beth;AN ARMY OF JERRYS.
2;7;Big Trouble In Little Sanchez;Beth Monster;THE VALUE OF HIS SUBSERVIENCE IS WASTED ON YOU. I WILL USE IT TO DOMINATE THE UNIVERSE.
2;7;Big Trouble In Little Sanchez;Beth;AH HA HA. BOY, JERRY MUST THINK I’M PRETTY STUPID, FOR YOU TO BE THIS STUPID. WOULDN’T IT MAKE MORE SENSE TO PUT MY DUMBASS HUSBAND IN THIS CHAIR, SO YOU CAN MAKE AN ARMY OF YOUBADASS SELF?
2;7;Big Trouble In Little Sanchez;Beth Monster;THERE COULD NEVER BE MORE THAN ONE OF ME. I’M THE STRONGEST, SMARTEST BEING ALIVE BECAUSE JERRY THINKS YOU’RE THAT MUCH STRONGER AND SMARTER THAN YOU ARE!
2;7;Big Trouble In Little Sanchez;Beth;OKAY, OUCH.
2;7;Big Trouble In Little Sanchez;Tiny Rick;"OH, HEY H-HEY-Y! MORTY, JESSICA, WHAT’S UP? CHECK OUT THE NEW DANCE I MADE UP. IT’S CALLED OOH LET ME OUT!"" AWESOME!"""
2;7;Big Trouble In Little Sanchez;Morty;OKAY, THAT LAST PART WAS REALLY WEIRD. MAYBE SUMMER’S ON TO SOMETHING HERE.
2;7;Big Trouble In Little Sanchez;Jessica;I DON’T KNOW. IT WAS FUN. YOU WANT TO SLOW DANCE?
2;7;Big Trouble In Little Sanchez;Principal;TINY RICK, HEY, GREAT DANCING AS USUAL. MOMENT OF YOUR TIME? TINY RICK, THIS CONVERSATION IS GONNA BREAK MY HEART WIDE OPEN. YOU’RE A GREAT STUDENT AND THE FACT THAT YOU’RE AN 80-YEAR-OLD MAN IN A CLONE BODY, IT NEVER BOTHERED ME. BUT THIS HERE IS ANOTHER MATTER. YOU RECOGNIZE THIS? WE GOT A TIP IT WAS IN YOUR LOCKER. YEAH, NOW, BECAUSE THE GYM COACH WAS A VAMPIRE, THE SCHOOL BOARD IS EMBARRASSED AND WON’T TAKE IT PUBLIC, HOWEVER, THEY CAN’T HAVE STUDENTS KILLIN’ TEACHERS. I GOTTA EXPEL YOU FOR THIS ONE, TR. I’M SORRY.
2;7;Big Trouble In Little Sanchez;Tiny Rick;I JUST GOT EXPELLED, SUMMER!
2;7;Big Trouble In Little Sanchez;Summer;OH! SO I GUESS THERE’S NO NEED TO STAY YOUNG. MY TOP!
2;7;Big Trouble In Little Sanchez;Tiny Rick;SCREW YOUR TOP! YOU RATTED ON ME?! I’M TINY RICK!
2;7;Big Trouble In Little Sanchez;Summer;FINE! YES! BECAUSE I LOVE YOU AND I’M TRYING TO SAVE YOUR LIFE!
2;7;Big Trouble In Little Sanchez;Tiny Rick;HIGH SCHOOL IS MY LIFE! SUMMER SMITH IS A  PSYCHO NERD AND SHE JUST GOT ME KICKED OUT OF SCHOOL!
2;7;Big Trouble In Little Sanchez;All;BOO!
2;7;Big Trouble In Little Sanchez;Toby;SUMMER, I THOUGHT YOU WERE COOL!
2;7;Big Trouble In Little Sanchez;Summer;I’M SORRY, OKAY?
2;7;Big Trouble In Little Sanchez;Crowd;HOW CAN YOU BE SUCH A BITCH?
2;7;Big Trouble In Little Sanchez;Jessica;OH, MY GOD, MORTY. YOUR SISTER CROSSED TINY RICK? TALK ABOUT SELF-DESTRUCTIVE. YEAH.
2;7;Big Trouble In Little Sanchez;Jerry;HEY, JERRY-LOVER! HOW ABOUT A TASTE OF THE REAL THING?  
2;7;Big Trouble In Little Sanchez;Beth;JERRY! AH. AH. AH. AH AH AH AH AH AAH AAH.
2;7;Big Trouble In Little Sanchez;Jerry;NOT ON MY WATCH. THAT’S IT! BETH, IT’S ME, YOUR HUSBAND! I’M HERE TO SAVE YOU. OR MY NAME ISN’T JERRY SMITH! AHA! YES! JERRY SMITH! YEAH, HERE. AHA! OKAY, FAIR ENOUGH.
2;7;Big Trouble In Little Sanchez;Tiny Rick;SAY GOODNIGHT, OLD MAN.
2;7;Big Trouble In Little Sanchez;Morty;WHAT THE HELL ARE YOU DOING? PUT IT DOWN!
2;7;Big Trouble In Little Sanchez;Tiny Rick;SUMMER, YOU BITCH!
2;7;Big Trouble In Little Sanchez;Morty;DON’T TALK TO HER THAT WAY! SHE’S YOUR GRANDDAUGHTER!
2;7;Big Trouble In Little Sanchez;Tiny Rick;I DON’T NEED A GRANDDAUGHTER! I’M TINY RI-I-CK!
2;7;Big Trouble In Little Sanchez;Morty;SHE’S MY SISTER! AND IF TINY RICK IS GONNA BE AN ASSHOLE TO MY SISTER, THEN, YOU KNOW, Y-Y-YOU MAY AS WELL BE OLD AGAIN.
2;7;Big Trouble In Little Sanchez;Tiny Rick;YOU THINK YOU’RE TOUGH, HUH, MORTY? WHAT ARE YOU GONNA DO? I’M TINY RICK.I ’M THE COOLEST KID IN YOUR SCHOOL. HOW ARE YOU GONNA JUST MAKE ME DO WHATEVER YOU SAY, HUH?
2;7;Big Trouble In Little Sanchez;Morty;I’M GONNA DO WHAT REAL RICK WOULD DO IF HE WAS HERE --
2;7;Big Trouble In Little Sanchez;Tiny Rick;I’M GONNA KICK YOUR ASS! OHHHH!
2;7;Big Trouble In Little Sanchez;Morty;RICK, I KNOW YOU’RE IN THERE! I KNOW YOU’RE TRYING TO GET OUT!
2;7;Big Trouble In Little Sanchez;Summer;THAT’S IT, MORTY! HOLD HIM DOWN!
2;7;Big Trouble In Little Sanchez;Summer;LISTEN TO IT, TINY RICK. LISTEN TO ELLIOTT SMITH.
2;7;Big Trouble In Little Sanchez;Tiny Rick;UGH! NO!
2;7;Big Trouble In Little Sanchez;Summer;FEEL WHAT HE’S FEELING.
2;7;Big Trouble In Little Sanchez;Tiny Rick;UGH! NOOOOOOOO! GOD!
2;7;Big Trouble In Little Sanchez;Rick;OH, GOD, WHAT IS LIFE? HOW CAN SOMEONE SO TALENTED DIE SO YOUNG? WHAT IS BEING YOUNG? I’M NOT YOUNG. I’M OLD. I’M -- I’M GONNA DIE. MY BODY ISN’T REAL. MORTY! SUMMER! IT’S ME! IT’S RICK! REGULAR RICK!
2;7;Big Trouble In Little Sanchez;Morty;RICK! HOW DO WE GET YOU BACK INTO YOUR BODY?
2;7;Big Trouble In Little Sanchez;Rick;OKAY, LISTEN CAREFULLY. THERE’S A SET OF DIODES ON THE VAT’S CONTROL PANEL, A BLUE ONE AND A RED ONE. OH, GOD, WHAT KIND OF WORLD IS THIS? I DIDN’T ASK TO BE BORN. I NEED YOU TO CONNECT THE BLUE ONE TO MY LEFT TEMPLE AND THE RED ONE TO -- WHY DOESN’T ANYONE REALLY LIKE ME?
2;7;Big Trouble In Little Sanchez;Summer;FOCUS, GRANDPA!
2;7;Big Trouble In Little Sanchez;Rick;JUST PUT THE STUPID WIRES ON MY HEAD! I HATE BEING A TEENAGER!
2;7;Big Trouble In Little Sanchez;Beth;JERRY, YOU CAN’T BEND METAL.
2;7;Big Trouble In Little Sanchez;Jerry;THEN MAKE A ME THAT CAN!
2;7;Big Trouble In Little Sanchez;Beth;HOW CAN I DO THAT WHILE I’M WATCHING YOU TOTALLY FAIL TO BEND METAL?
2;7;Big Trouble In Little Sanchez;Jerry;GOOD OLD BETH!
2;7;Big Trouble In Little Sanchez;God Beth;THE MIND OF A ROBOT AND THE HEART OF AN INSECT!
2;7;Big Trouble In Little Sanchez;Jerry;DON’T TALK THAT WAY ABOUT HER. WHAT? OH, IT HURTS! OH, GOD.
2;7;Big Trouble In Little Sanchez;God Beth;STOP. THIS REPRESENTATION DISPLEASES ME.
2;7;Big Trouble In Little Sanchez;Beth;GOOD LORD. HOW DID YOU...?
2;7;Big Trouble In Little Sanchez;Jerry;WELL, I HAD A FEELING THAT, IN YOUR MIND, THE IDEAL VERSION OF ME IS ONE SMART ENOUGH TO SEE YOU AS...
2;7;Big Trouble In Little Sanchez;Beth;A GODDESS. NOT SUCH A STUPID WORM NOW, ARE YOU?
2;7;Big Trouble In Little Sanchez;Jerry;HONEY, WHEN IT COMES TO THE SUBJECT OF YOUR EGO, I’M STEPHEN  HAWKINSON.
2;7;Big Trouble In Little Sanchez;Beth;UGH, IT’S -- NEVER MIND. I LOVE YOU.
2;7;Big Trouble In Little Sanchez;Rick;UGH AGH.
2;7;Big Trouble In Little Sanchez;Morty;RICK!
2;7;Big Trouble In Little Sanchez;Summer;PANTS!
2;7;Big Trouble In Little Sanchez;Rick;HOLY SH1T! THANKS, KIDS. YOU FIGURED IT OUT. WELL, SUMMER DID. KIND OF WEIRD THAT YOU WERE THAT WILLING TO SELL MY EXISTENCE OUT FOR SOME TRIM, MORTY.
2;7;Big Trouble In Little Sanchez;Morty;WHAT?!
2;7;Big Trouble In Little Sanchez;Summer;PANTS!
2;7;Big Trouble In Little Sanchez;Rick;BUT LISTEN -- I FORGIVE YOU BOTH BECAUSE YOU KNOW WHAT? I LEARNED, TODAY, SOMETHING IMPORTANT -- THE TEENAGE MIND IS ITS OWN WORST ENEMY. OH, I ALSO LEARNED THIS...  OPERATION PHOENIX IS NOT THE FALLBACK I THOUGHT IT WOULD BE. I GUESS IT’S BACK TO THE DRAWING BOARD.
2;7;Big Trouble In Little Sanchez;Summer;OH, MY GOD!
2;7;Big Trouble In Little Sanchez;Morty;OH, MY GOD!
2;7;Big Trouble In Little Sanchez;Summer;OH, MY GOD. PUT SOME PANTS ON! PUT PANTS ON.
2;7;Big Trouble In Little Sanchez;Rick;GRANDPA’S BACK, BABY! GRANDPA’S --  OH, MAN, I GOTTA PICK UP YOUR PARENTS. THEY HAVE BEEN BLOWIN’ ME UP. ONE LAST SWING FOR THE ROAD! AAAAAAAAAAAH!
2;7;Big Trouble In Little Sanchez;Summer;FOR THE LOVE OF GOD, GET DRESSED!
2;7;Big Trouble In Little Sanchez;Jerry;SO, WHAT DO YOU THINK? YOU WANNA KEEP THIS MARRIAGE GOING A WHILE LONGER?
2;7;Big Trouble In Little Sanchez;Beth;AT LEAST UNTIL MORTY HAS GRADUATED HIGH SCHOOL. OH. MM.
2;7;Big Trouble In Little Sanchez;Rick;AHA, YOU SEE? WHAT DID I TELL YOU TWO? IT WORKED.
2;7;Big Trouble In Little Sanchez;Jerry;YOU KNOW WHAT, RICK? I GUESS, IN A WAY --
2;7;Big Trouble In Little Sanchez;Rick;ALREADY LOST INTEREST. GET IN THE CAR. I’VE BEEN INSIDE A KID ALL DAY AND, NOW, I CAN FEEL MY BONES SCRAPING EACH OTHER. UH, JUST SO YOU’RE PREPARED, THERE’S A BUNCH OF DEAD MES IN THE GARAGE.
2;7;Big Trouble In Little Sanchez;Jerry;HUH! SOUNDS LIKE OUR STORIES WERE CONNECTED BY A THEME.
2;7;Big Trouble In Little Sanchez;Rick;NOT REALLY, JERRY. PROBABLY A COSMETIC CONNECTION YOUR MIND MISTAKES FOR THEMATIC.
2;7;Big Trouble In Little Sanchez;Jerry;OH.
2;7;Big Trouble In Little Sanchez;Rick;OLD RICK! RUININ’ EVERYTHING!
2;8;Interdimensional Cable 2: Tempting Fate;Rick;Don't worry about Jerry. He's gonna be fine.You hear me Jerry? You're gonna be fine!
2;8;Interdimensional Cable 2: Tempting Fate;Morty;Woahh!
2;8;Interdimensional Cable 2: Tempting Fate;Rick;ooo... Watch out for that stuff. It'll stain if it gets on your clothes, and it'll send into a murderous rage if it gets in your eyes or mouth.
2;8;Interdimensional Cable 2: Tempting Fate;Beth;Why would you keep mutant bacteria in a pint of Cherry Garcia?
2;8;Interdimensional Cable 2: Tempting Fate;Rick;I know this isn't the time, but, you know, technically the second freezer drawer is mine.
2;8;Interdimensional Cable 2: Tempting Fate;Beth;Not anymore.
2;8;Interdimensional Cable 2: Tempting Fate;Rick;You're overreacting!
2;8;Interdimensional Cable 2: Tempting Fate;Alien Nurse;We're losing him.
2;8;Interdimensional Cable 2: Tempting Fate;Rick;Alright fine, but you're not touching my CRISPR.
2;8;Interdimensional Cable 2: Tempting Fate;Summer;Is he going to die?
2;8;Interdimensional Cable 2: Tempting Fate;Alien Nurse;Don't worry. Dr. Glipglop is the best in the galaxy
2;8;Interdimensional Cable 2: Tempting Fate;Dr. Glipglop;Hello, I'm Dr. Glipglop.
2;8;Interdimensional Cable 2: Tempting Fate;Rick;What? Every hospital claims to have the best doctor in the galaxy. It's like those pizza places that claim to have the best pizza in the world. What- Do you think they have pizza contests? Have you ever been to a pizza contest?
2;8;Interdimensional Cable 2: Tempting Fate;Beth;Go in the waiting room, Dad.
2;8;Interdimensional Cable 2: Tempting Fate;Rick;Fine!  Excuse me. Coming through. What are you here for- Just kidding, I don't care. Well this won't do.
2;8;Interdimensional Cable 2: Tempting Fate;Alien Nurse;Hey! What are you doing!?!
2;8;Interdimensional Cable 2: Tempting Fate;Rick;A sequel.
2;8;Interdimensional Cable 2: Tempting Fate;Alien Nurse;I don't understand.
2;8;Interdimensional Cable 2: Tempting Fate;Rick;Yeah me neither, we pretty much nailed it the first time. 
2;8;Interdimensional Cable 2: Tempting Fate;Randy Dicknose;Man vs. Car. The newest hit show where it pits a man vs. a car. Tonight's episode Jenkins fights... a regular old car. Here we go. He's pushin' his way through, he's trying to fight that car. The car seems to have the upper hand- Oh, he just got some push-back there.
2;8;Interdimensional Cable 2: Tempting Fate;Randy Dicknose;Oh, he just got ran over and chewed up by the tires. I guess that's another one for the car. Ha ha ha ha ha... I mean, wouldn't the cars always win...?
2;8;Interdimensional Cable 2: Tempting Fate;Alien Man;Samantha, I need to know that you understand that I have a couple of eye-holes. 
2;8;Interdimensional Cable 2: Tempting Fate;Samantha;I do, I do understand about your eye-holes! Here, look at my eye-holes! 
2;8;Interdimensional Cable 2: Tempting Fate;Alien Man;Oh, my goodness you have eight eye-holes!  Oh, I'm looking through your eye-holes!
2;8;Interdimensional Cable 2: Tempting Fate;Samantha;Yes, look through my eye-holes!
2;8;Interdimensional Cable 2: Tempting Fate;Eye-hole Man;I'm the Eye-hole Man! I'm the only one whose allowed... to have eye-holes!  Get on up outta here with my eye-holes!
2;8;Interdimensional Cable 2: Tempting Fate;Announcer;Eye-holes! Get them today! IKEA.
2;8;Interdimensional Cable 2: Tempting Fate;Rick;You gotta be careful Morty, if that guy catches you with a box of his eye-holes he comes bursting in through a window and just starts kicking the shit outta you. But it's worth the risk, they melt in your mouth Morty! They're delicious.
2;8;Interdimensional Cable 2: Tempting Fate;Beth;I can't believe you're explaining alien cereal, we're worried about Jerry.
2;8;Interdimensional Cable 2: Tempting Fate;Rick;Well you're thirty-nine years too late, or however old he is. Is he fifty? Jesus, Christ, Beth is, is Jerry fifity!?
2;8;Interdimensional Cable 2: Tempting Fate;Jerry;Where am I?
2;8;Interdimensional Cable 2: Tempting Fate;Alien Doctor;Relax Mr. Smith, you're in an alien hospital. I mean to you it's an alien hospital, to me you're just in a hospital. There's another matter we need to discuss with you.
2;8;Interdimensional Cable 2: Tempting Fate;Alien Doctor;Jerry
2;8;Interdimensional Cable 2: Tempting Fate;Alien 1;An hour ago Shrimply Pibbles, the galaxy's most influential civil rights leader, was brought to this hospital's emergency room where he is currently fighting for his life!
2;8;Interdimensional Cable 2: Tempting Fate;Jerry;My God!
2;8;Interdimensional Cable 2: Tempting Fate;Alien 1;Mr. Smith, Shrimply Pibble's life can be saved if we replace his heart with your human penis.
2;8;Interdimensional Cable 2: Tempting Fate;Jerry;I see-WAIT! What?
2;8;Interdimensional Cable 2: Tempting Fate;Alien Doctor;"It's perfect! The configuration of veins, the ratio of thickness to elasticity, the delicate asymmetry of what you call your balls"". With relatively few adjustments"
2;8;Interdimensional Cable 2: Tempting Fate;Jerry;Yeah, but, I mean-
2;8;Interdimensional Cable 2: Tempting Fate;Alien 2;Oh, forget it! I told you this was a waste of time!
2;8;Interdimensional Cable 2: Tempting Fate;Alien 1;Have respect Yarp, the earth man's world is tiny and undeveloped. He knows nothing of the genocides of Klorgon or the tragic events of 6-5.3-4-3-2.2-3-14
2;8;Interdimensional Cable 2: Tempting Fate;Old Alien;"And even if he did, he wouldn't comprehend them. I've dwelt among the humans. Their entire culture is built around their penises. It's funny to say they are small, it's funny to say they are big. I've been at parties, where humans have held bottles, pencils, thermoses in front of themselves and called out hey look at me! I'm Mr. so and so dick."" ""I've got such and such for a penis."" I never saw it fail to get a laugh."""
2;8;Interdimensional Cable 2: Tempting Fate;Jerry;Alright! That's enough. You guys are talking about my species! We understand genocide, we do it sometimes!
2;8;Interdimensional Cable 2: Tempting Fate;Alien 1;Then you would give your penis so that Shrimply Pibbles may live?
2;8;Interdimensional Cable 2: Tempting Fate;Alien 2;Stop asking!
2;8;Interdimensional Cable 2: Tempting Fate;Jerry;Yes I will! That's right, assholes, take my penis, TAKE IT ALL! And tell Shrimply Pimples that when the galaxy came calling, Jerry Smith from Earth didn't flinch!
2;8;Interdimensional Cable 2: Tempting Fate;Rick;Hey, what's wrong Morty? Oh, you're worried about your dad, huh?
2;8;Interdimensional Cable 2: Tempting Fate;Morty;Huh? Uh, no no no, I'm-I'm just looking at that lady getting coffee. What's up with her face? Is she a human or is she like Worf. You know Worf, from Star Trek, how he has the shit all over his face but he's just a human in a costume, you know?
2;8;Interdimensional Cable 2: Tempting Fate;Rick;Morty let's-let's see what else is on.
2;8;Interdimensional Cable 2: Tempting Fate;Morty;Okay.
2;8;Interdimensional Cable 2: Tempting Fate;TV Host;"And now we're back to ""How Did I Get Here?"" The only show that makes you ask ""How Did I Get Here?""  Here's our first person!"
2;8;Interdimensional Cable 2: Tempting Fate;Worf Lady;Oh, oh my goodness! How did I get here? HELLO!?! How did I get here!?! Somebody help me, please!
2;8;Interdimensional Cable 2: Tempting Fate;TV Host;Ha ha ha ha, right!
2;8;Interdimensional Cable 2: Tempting Fate;Morty;Whoa! Look! It's that lady with all that shit on her face like Worf from Star Trek! Tha-That was getting coffee! How did she get there!
2;8;Interdimensional Cable 2: Tempting Fate;Rick;Oh, man Morty. How DID she get there?
2;8;Interdimensional Cable 2: Tempting Fate;TV Host;How DID she get there? He he 
2;8;Interdimensional Cable 2: Tempting Fate;Beth;Is that something we should be concerned about?
2;8;Interdimensional Cable 2: Tempting Fate;Rick;Just stay away from the coffee machine.
2;8;Interdimensional Cable 2: Tempting Fate;TV;Calling all Jan-Michael Vincent's, calling all Jan-Michael Vincent's!
2;8;Interdimensional Cable 2: Tempting Fate;Announcer;In a world, where there's eight Jan-Michael Vincents.
2;8;Interdimensional Cable 2: Tempting Fate;Intercom ;We need one Jan-Michael Vincent to quadrant C. Two Jan-Michael Vincents to quadrant E.
2;8;Interdimensional Cable 2: Tempting Fate;Announcer;And sixteen quadrants. There's only enough time for a Jan-Michael Vincent to make it to a quadrant. He can't be in two quadrants at once.
2;8;Interdimensional Cable 2: Tempting Fate;Morty;Rick, who-who is Jan-Michael Vincent?
2;8;Interdimensional Cable 2: Tempting Fate;Rick;Oh man, I'm trying to remember Morty.
2;8;Interdimensional Cable 2: Tempting Fate;Announcer;Jan-Michael Vincents are used up.
2;8;Interdimensional Cable 2: Tempting Fate; Radio Control Guy;I need a goddamn Jan-Michael Vincent!
2;8;Interdimensional Cable 2: Tempting Fate;Morty;Is it important that we know who Jan-Michael Vincent is in order to get this?
2;8;Interdimensional Cable 2: Tempting Fate;Rick;Nope.
2;8;Interdimensional Cable 2: Tempting Fate;Alien-Robo Judge;I refuse to sign the legislation that allows more than eight Jan-Michael Vincents to a precinct.
2;8;Interdimensional Cable 2: Tempting Fate;Announcer;This JANuary, It's time to MIKE down your Vincent's. Jan Quadrant Vincent 16.
2;8;Interdimensional Cable 2: Tempting Fate;Rick and Morty;Whoa!
2;8;Interdimensional Cable 2: Tempting Fate;Rick;That's Jan-Michaels.
2;8;Interdimensional Cable 2: Tempting Fate;Morty;Excuse me, nurse, can you take my temperature? Because I think I have Jan Quadrant Vincent fever over here.
2;8;Interdimensional Cable 2: Tempting Fate;Rick;All right, Morty you've done it!
2;8;Interdimensional Cable 2: Tempting Fate;Alien Doctor;So, we'll be detaching your sexual organ at the base by making incisions here,here, and here. 
2;8;Interdimensional Cable 2: Tempting Fate;Jerry;Got it.
2;8;Interdimensional Cable 2: Tempting Fate;Alien Doctor;Leaving a partial length of severed urethra to be threaded through-
2;8;Interdimensional Cable 2: Tempting Fate;Jerry; Oh, you know what, I gotta laugh at myself here! I'm having a little laugh at myself because I just realized I haven't run this whole decision past my wife.
2;8;Interdimensional Cable 2: Tempting Fate;Alien Doctor;Oh, do you think she'll be okay with this?
2;8;Interdimensional Cable 2: Tempting Fate;Jerry;Oh, absolutely. Beth is automatically on board, always, with every decision I make.
2;8;Interdimensional Cable 2: Tempting Fate;Stealy;Hey, I'm Stealy. Follow me on my adventure through this office. Alright, here we go. We're gonna just steal a couple of things. 
2;8;Interdimensional Cable 2: Tempting Fate;Business Man;Excuse me. Can I help you?
2;8;Interdimensional Cable 2: Tempting Fate;Stealy;Starting with common office objects.
2;8;Interdimensional Cable 2: Tempting Fate;Business Man;Hey, hey, hey! That's my stuff!
2;8;Interdimensional Cable 2: Tempting Fate;Stealy;Such as staplers and pins and all sorts of things like-such as that.
2;8;Interdimensional Cable 2: Tempting Fate;Business Man;That's it. I'm calling security.
2;8;Interdimensional Cable 2: Tempting Fate;Stealy;All right, okay, we're in the quiet safe room where none of the people whose stuff I stole can get to us. Now, let's look at all the stuff we got. We got a bag of Bobbish. That's eight brapples. We got a plumbus. That's six and a half brapples. We got, uh, a-crushed party cups. Fifteen and a half brapples.
2;8;Interdimensional Cable 2: Tempting Fate;Comedian;"Welcome back to ""funny songs"". It's all improvised. It's very funny. I need a volunteer from the audience."
2;8;Interdimensional Cable 2: Tempting Fate;A man in the audience;Um, longtime fan of the show. Uh-
2;8;Interdimensional Cable 2: Tempting Fate;Comedian;What do you do? What is your profession?
2;8;Interdimensional Cable 2: Tempting Fate;A man in the audience;I am a tax attorney.
2;8;Interdimensional Cable 2: Tempting Fate;Comedian; Okay here we go. Hit-hit the music. I'm a tax attorney, oh.
2;8;Interdimensional Cable 2: Tempting Fate;A man in the audience;Oh man. Oh, that was so-so funny. Thank you.
2;8;Interdimensional Cable 2: Tempting Fate;Comedian;You're welcome. Hey, um, security guards, take him out. Get him out of here.
2;8;Interdimensional Cable 2: Tempting Fate;A man in the audience;What?
2;8;Interdimensional Cable 2: Tempting Fate;Comedian;Get the orthodontist out of here.
2;8;Interdimensional Cable 2: Tempting Fate;A man in the audience;No! Why?!?
2;8;Interdimensional Cable 2: Tempting Fate;Comedian;Take him out of the audience. Kill him. Sick him.  Demons, suck his life out. I don't give a shit.
2;8;Interdimensional Cable 2: Tempting Fate;Alien Doctor;Smith family?
2;8;Interdimensional Cable 2: Tempting Fate;Beth;Yes?
2;8;Interdimensional Cable 2: Tempting Fate;Alien Doctor;I wanted to let you all know that Jerry is doing just fine.
2;8;Interdimensional Cable 2: Tempting Fate;All;Yeah, whoo, awesome, called it, that's good news!
2;8;Interdimensional Cable 2: Tempting Fate;Alien Doctor;But, ah, Mrs. Smith, could you come with me?
2;8;Interdimensional Cable 2: Tempting Fate;Jerry;Hi, honey, so, here's the thing-these guys-they want to completely remove my penis and use it as an alien's heart, and we just need you to sign off on it.
2;8;Interdimensional Cable 2: Tempting Fate;Beth;WHAT!?!
2;8;Interdimensional Cable 2: Tempting Fate;Jerry;Uh-oh, maybe we have a problem here after all guys. Yikes.
2;8;Interdimensional Cable 2: Tempting Fate;Alien Doctor;His penis will be replaced with a sophisticated prosthetic, now there's a wide range of options to chose from, they're all in this catalog.
2;8;Interdimensional Cable 2: Tempting Fate;Beth;I don't care about prosthetics, this is insane! What do you people think you're doing?
2;8;Interdimensional Cable 2: Tempting Fate;Alien Doctor;I understand your feelings, Mrs. Smith.
2;8;Interdimensional Cable 2: Tempting Fate;Beth;Oh, I don't think you do. I bring my husband in for emergency medical treatment, he's gone an hour, and now you want his PENIS, and you hand me some... catalog. It's--It's--It's--It's, I mean.
2;8;Interdimensional Cable 2: Tempting Fate;Jerry;Sheesh, well, there you go. Sorry. I know it's hard to understand, but on Earth, love comes first.
2;8;Interdimensional Cable 2: Tempting Fate;Alien Doctor;There are those that believe, Mr. Smith, that Shrimply Pibbles represents love between all life. His fate will determine the fate of hundreds of billions of sentient life forms.
2;8;Interdimensional Cable 2: Tempting Fate;Beth;Woah! Woah. So, billions of life forms?
2;8;Interdimensional Cable 2: Tempting Fate;Alien Doctor;Hundreds of billions.
2;8;Interdimensional Cable 2: Tempting Fate;Beth;I mean, Jerry, y-you didn't explain the full gravity of the situation.
2;8;Interdimensional Cable 2: Tempting Fate;Jerry;Uh, well, Beth, I don't think your decision should be based on politics. Who could argue with a wife's decision to keep her LOVER INTACT.
2;8;Interdimensional Cable 2: Tempting Fate;Beth;Well I don't think that's fair at all, Jerry. At all. In fact, I think this whole paradigm has sexist overtones.
2;8;Interdimensional Cable 2: Tempting Fate;Jerry;Beth, can we talk about this privately?
2;8;Interdimensional Cable 2: Tempting Fate;Beth;"You know, I think, the bottom line is, Jerry, if you want to keep your penis, you should say, out loud, I prefer to keep my penis."""""
2;8;Interdimensional Cable 2: Tempting Fate;Jerry ;But, Beth, what kind of man would say something like that if the universe needed his penis!?!
2;8;Interdimensional Cable 2: Tempting Fate;Beth;Well, Jerry, what kind of wife would I be if I did anything to stand in your way?
2;8;Interdimensional Cable 2: Tempting Fate;Restaurant chef;Hey, listen, is your mouth tiny and small? Then why don't you come down to 'Little Bits?'
2;8;Interdimensional Cable 2: Tempting Fate;Background whisper;LIttle Bits!
2;8;Interdimensional Cable 2: Tempting Fate;Resturant chef ;Where the food is tiny...it looks like regular food. But really tiny. You put it in your mouth and eat it. Nothing gets stuck in your lips. It's just tiny and tiny and fits  fits right in!
2;8;Interdimensional Cable 2: Tempting Fate;Background whisper;Little Bits!
2;8;Interdimensional Cable 2: Tempting Fate;Restaurant chef; We got....tiny uh-lasagna. tiny pizza, tiny pie. Mmh! Little tiny...fried eggs!  Oh, shit! We got tiny people!
2;8;Interdimensional Cable 2: Tempting Fate;Background whisper;Little Bits!
2;8;Interdimensional Cable 2: Tempting Fate;Restaurant chef;You hungry? Come on down!
2;8;Interdimensional Cable 2: Tempting Fate;Background whisper;Little Bits!
2;8;Interdimensional Cable 2: Tempting Fate;Restaurant chef;Eat some fucking shit, you fucking stupid bitch!  Just kidding.
2;8;Interdimensional Cable 2: Tempting Fate;Alien doctor;You got some time to kill befpre the procedure, so I assume you'd like to uh....use your penis one last time. Here's my computer. It's got the alien internet on it.  There's some...porn. And there's an alien towel- I actually got that on another planet, so it is an alien towel to me! Good luck!
2;8;Interdimensional Cable 2: Tempting Fate;Jerry;Thanks.  What is this?  Hmm..Hey! Wait a minute!
2;8;Interdimensional Cable 2: Tempting Fate;Alien doctor ;Oh, um...Mr. Smith!
2;8;Interdimensional Cable 2: Tempting Fate;Jerry;Yeah, just masturbating!
2;8;Interdimensional Cable 2: Tempting Fate;Alien doctor ;I forgot to mention, there are extensive medical records open on my desktop, but >I trust you to confine your activities to the purely pornographic.
2;8;Interdimensional Cable 2: Tempting Fate;Jerry;Absolutely!
2;8;Interdimensional Cable 2: Tempting Fate;Alien doctor ;Good luck!
2;8;Interdimensional Cable 2: Tempting Fate;Jerry;My God!  Mr. Pibbles.  You just wrote my penis a one-way ticket to staying on my body town.
2;8;Interdimensional Cable 2: Tempting Fate;Announcer;It's the Opposite news, with Michael Thompson!
2;8;Interdimensional Cable 2: Tempting Fate;Michael Thompson;Hey, everybody, it's me, Michael Thompson! Today, the pope...didn't..get killed!  He's perfectly fine...and he's on vacation on Aruba.Uh. In other opposite news information-

2;8;Interdimensional Cable 2: Tempting Fate;Michael Thompson;You quit tugging! I'm in the middle of my news!
2;8;Interdimensional Cable 2: Tempting Fate;Pichael Thompson;Oh, oh, it's always about you, isn't it. Can you believe this guy, ladies and gentlemen? He'S got his own news show, he' got a normal name..
2;8;Interdimensional Cable 2: Tempting Fate;Morty;Hey, flip back to the news!
2;8;Interdimensional Cable 2: Tempting Fate;Rick;Oh, yeah, yeah,yeah!
2;8;Interdimensional Cable 2: Tempting Fate;Pichael Thomson;You can tell our parents started with naming him.It's like, oh, Michael. They had that one planned before they even got pregnant, I bet.
2;8;Interdimensional Cable 2: Tempting Fate;Summer;I don't wanna be that girl, but maybe there would be less conflict if they didn't shoot there shows at the same time?
2;8;Interdimensional Cable 2: Tempting Fate;Rick;Uh, Summer, you have no idea how much money that must save productions.
2;8;Interdimensional Cable 2: Tempting Fate;Pichael Thompson;And then they found out I was attached to him along for the ride and they said, 'Ah well, shit. Ah, just fuck it, call him Pichael!
2;8;Interdimensional Cable 2: Tempting Fate;Michael Thompson;Fuck you, Pichael! You're a fucking piece of shit!
2;8;Interdimensional Cable 2: Tempting Fate;Alien 1;Good afternoon!I know all of you are wondering about the condition of our dear beloved Pibbles.
2;8;Interdimensional Cable 2: Tempting Fate;Beth;Which would you prefer between the XP20 and the XP20XS?
2;8;Interdimensional Cable 2: Tempting Fate;Jerry;I prefer my own penis! And so should you!
2;8;Interdimensional Cable 2: Tempting Fate;Alien 1;The brave earth man whose sacrifice is going to allow Shrimply Pibbles to live.Mr. Jerry Smith. 
2;8;Interdimensional Cable 2: Tempting Fate;Jerry;Hello, everyone! Let's hear it again for Shrimply Pibbles, huh.  He's a good guy, isn't he?  I've just been learning about his accomplishments, from his march on Flirk Blirk Square, to his ongoing battle with heroin dependancy, he's the best.  Um...yeah..well...it occurs to me that his heroin addiction may not have been a matter of public record!
2;8;Interdimensional Cable 2: Tempting Fate;Male reporter alien 1;You realize heroin makes up to ten percent of the atmosphere on Shrimply Pibbles' home planet?
2;8;Interdimensional Cable 2: Tempting Fate;Female reporter alien;His planet got destroyed by Clorgon death squads, he can't live outside of it without breathing heroin.
2;8;Interdimensional Cable 2: Tempting Fate;Jerry;Right! I know that! I just think...
2;8;Interdimensional Cable 2: Tempting Fate;Male reporter alien 2;This guy's trying to get out of giving away his penis! 
2;9;Look Who's Purging Now;Morty;I got to tell you, Rick. It’s pretty great to be in this spaceship, just the two of us, you know? Just cruising around, Rick and Morty style.
2;9;Look Who's Purging Now;Rick;I agree, Morty.  It’s nice to get back to the basics after a pretty intense, mixed-bag of a year.
2;9;Look Who's Purging Now;Morty;Ohh!
2;9;Look Who's Purging Now;Rick;Relax. That’s what windshields are for.
2;9;Look Who's Purging Now;Morty;I didn’t know that there were bugs out in space.
2;9;Look Who's Purging Now;Rick;Well, w-what did you think, Morty? Life just developed on earth by itself? Here, let me take care of this.
2;9;Look Who's Purging Now;Morty;Geez, Rick, that’s disgusting. I don’t want to look at that.
2;9;Look Who's Purging Now;Rick;Yeah, guess I’m out of fluid. L-let me find a place to stop. Hey, muchacho, does your planet have wiper fluid yet, or are you gonna freak out and start worshipping us?
2;9;Look Who's Purging Now;Farmer;The general store ought to have what you need.
2;9;Look Who's Purging Now;Rick;Thanks.
2;9;Look Who's Purging Now;Farmer;Of course, you’ll be wanting to be gone from here by sundown.
2;9;Look Who's Purging Now;Rick;Yeah, sure thing. Wait a minute. What? Why?
2;9;Look Who's Purging Now;Farmer;Sundown is when the festival begins.
2;9;Look Who's Purging Now;Morty;The festival?
2;9;Look Who's Purging Now;Farmer;Ooh, well, for millennia, our society has been free of crime and war, living in perfect peace.
2;9;Look Who's Purging Now;Rick;Oh, I know what this is! You’ve been able to sustain world peace because you have one night a year where you all run around robbing and murdering each other without consequence.
2;9;Look Who's Purging Now;Farmer;That’s right.
2;9;Look Who's Purging Now;Morty;What?!
2;9;Look Who's Purging Now;Rick;It’s like the purge
2;9;Look Who's Purging Now;Farmer;Oh, have you been here before?
2;9;Look Who's Purging Now;Rick;No, no, but I’ve been to a few planets with the same gimmick. You know, sometimes it’s called the cleansing or the red time. There was this one world that called it just murder night. I-it’s a purge planet. They’re peaceful, and then, you know, they just purge.
2;9;Look Who's Purging Now;Morty;T-that’s horrible!
2;9;Look Who's Purging Now;Rick;Yeah. You want to check it out?
2;9;Look Who's Purging Now;Rick;SO, WHAT DO YOU DO DURING THE FESTIVAL? YOU LOCK YOURSELF IN, OR YOU GO OUT AND DO SOME STUFF?

2;10;The Wedding Squanchers;Beth;Jerry, get a job.
2;10;The Wedding Squanchers;Rick;Uh, w-why don't you get it Jerry? you're the man of the house and you don't have a job.
2;10;The Wedding Squanchers;Courier Flap; Delivery for Rick, Morty, Summer, Beth and Jerry.
2;10;The Wedding Squanchers;Summer; Gross, what is that thing?
2;10;The Wedding Squanchers;Rick;It's a Courier Flap, it's like the Intergalactic version of UPS but less off-putting.  OH SHIEEET! It looks like an egg-vite from Birdperson! It must be time for his annual Oscar party. By the way, our TV signals take lightyears to reach his planet, nobody tell him that Braveheart wins.
2;10;The Wedding Squanchers;Birdperson's Voice;Greetings, this is Birdperson.
2;10;The Wedding Squanchers;Tammy's Voice;And Tammy!
2;10;The Wedding Squanchers;Birdperson's Voice;Inviting you to Planet Squanch for our mate-melding ceremony.
2;10;The Wedding Squanchers;Rick; Ughhhh... 
2;10;The Wedding Squanchers;Tammy's Voice; If you're not a bird, that means we're getting married!
2;10;The Wedding Squanchers;Summer;Oh my God! My friend Tammy's marrying Birdperson!
2;10;The Wedding Squanchers;Jerry;What the hell is a 'Birdperson,'?
2;10;The Wedding Squanchers;Morty;He's Rick's best friend.
2;10;The Wedding Squanchers;Rick;Uhhhh, l-l-let's not get carried away, Morty.
2;10;The Wedding Squanchers;Courier Flaps;Would you like to RSVP or send a gift?
2;10;The Wedding Squanchers;Rick;No. Weddings are basically funerals with cake. If I wanted to watch someone throw their life away,  I'd hang out with Jerry all day.
2;10;The Wedding Squanchers;Courier Flap;Affirmative. Returning to sender. 
2;10;The Wedding Squanchers;Beth;No, hold on, stay... 'Courier Flaps.'
2;10;The Wedding Squanchers;Courier Flap; Staying.
2;10;The Wedding Squanchers;Beth;Dad, you have a friend that's getting married... that's a big deal.
2;10;The Wedding Squanchers;Jerry; it's a big deal he has a friend.
2;10;The Wedding Squanchers;Rick;What do you know about friendship, Jerrrrrry?
2;10;The Wedding Squanchers;Courier Flap;Confirm, shipping Jerry. 
2;10;The Wedding Squanchers;Beth;Oh God, Jerry?! 
2;10;The Wedding Squanchers;Summer and Morty;Dad?! 
2;10;The Wedding Squanchers;Beth; Where is it taking him?
2;10;The Wedding Squanchers;Rick; I assume Planet Squanch, 6000 lightyears across the galaxy.
2;10;The Wedding Squanchers;Morty;Wh?-Wh- th-th-that's insane!
2;10;The Wedding Squanchers;Rick;Yeah, I know. Now we have to go to the wedding.
2;10;The Wedding Squanchers;Squanchy;Rick Sanchez, you psycho bag of Squanch!
2;10;The Wedding Squanchers;Rick; Hey, what's up, Squanchy?
2;10;The Wedding Squanchers;Summer and Morty; Heya Squanchy.
2;10;The Wedding Squanchers;Squanchy;Morty, Summer! And you must be Beth.  Au squanché.
2;10;The Wedding Squanchers;Beth; Your language has 'squanch,' in it a lot. Doesn't that become tedious and worn out like the Smurf thing?
2;10;The Wedding Squanchers;Rick;Beth, Squanchy culture is more... contextual than literal. You just say what's in your squanch and people understand.
2;10;The Wedding Squanchers;Beth;Oh, okay... I squanch my family.
2;10;The Wedding Squanchers;Squanchy;Uhh...
2;10;The Wedding Squanchers;Beth;What? I do, I squanch my family.
2;10;The Wedding Squanchers;Squanchy;Just stop saying it, gross.
2;10;The Wedding Squanchers;Photography Cyborg;I am not staring at you. I am Cyborg photographer, just act natural. This is a candid shot, I don't require a camera so...  Sorry.  Hi, I am not staring at you.
2;10;The Wedding Squanchers;Rick;But, BUT. Here's the thing, Birdperson is my best friend, and if he he loves Tammy, well then I love Tammy too.
2;10;The Wedding Squanchers;Rick;To friendship, to love and to my greatest adventure yet, opening myself up to others!
2;10;The Wedding Squanchers;Morty;Cheers to that, motherfuckers!
2;10;The Wedding Squanchers;Tammy;"Thank you, Rick. That was beautiful. Cuz I look around this room, and I think ""Uh Tammy,  you're a high school senior from the Planet Earth and you're marrying a 40 year old Birdperson"", like ""Whaaat?"""
2;10;The Wedding Squanchers;Summer;Yeah Tammy!
2;10;The Wedding Squanchers;Tammy;Then I think, you know in a lot of ways I'm not a high school senior from the planet Earth. In a lot ways what I really am, is a deep-cover agent for the Galactic Federation, and you guys are a group of wanted criminals, and this entire building is in a certain sense surrounded.
2;10;The Wedding Squanchers;Morty;Huh?
2;10;The Wedding Squanchers;Summer;What?
2;10;The Wedding Squanchers;Rick;Oh shit.
2;10;The Wedding Squanchers;Beth;I don't get the metaphor.
2;10;The Wedding Squanchers;Jerry;I'll explain it to you later.
2;10;The Wedding Squanchers;Tammy;Everyone here is under arrested for the crime against the Federation! 
2;10;The Wedding Squanchers;Humanoid Quest;L'chaim!
2;10;The Wedding Squanchers;Birdperson; Tammy, what are you doing here?
2;10;The Wedding Squanchers;Tammy; Sit! Your bird ass, down!
2;10;The Wedding Squanchers;Birdperson;Tammy?
2;10;The Wedding Squanchers;Birdperson;Caaww! Caww...
2;10;The Wedding Squanchers;Rick;Birdperson, NOOOOOOOO!!
2;10;The Wedding Squanchers;Squanchy;RAAOOWWARR!!!  WHAT ABOUT A TASTE OF MY SQUANCH!!?? 
2;10;The Wedding Squanchers;Rick;Come on, this way!
2;10;The Wedding Squanchers;Squanchy;SQAUSH THIS!! 
2;10;The Wedding Squanchers;Jerry;I'm just saying, we keep acting like there's only two options, but there's not. So, yes, if we went back to earth, as long as Rick was out there, they’d want to interrogate us. But, and this is purely hypothetical, what if we turned your father in to the government?
2;10;The Wedding Squanchers;Beth;Jerry, so help me god, if you ever bring this up again, no more bacon.
2;10;The Wedding Squanchers;Jerry;There already is no more bacon! This world sucks! Our life sucks! Why are we doing this for someone that would never do anything for anyone but himself?
2;10;The Wedding Squanchers;Morty;That's not the point, Dad! We love Rick! F-For the most part.
2;10;The Wedding Squanchers;Summer;Yeah, you don't love people in hopes of a reward, Dad. You love them unconditionally.
2;10;The Wedding Squanchers;Beth;That's very good, kids. I'm proud of you.
2;10;The Wedding Squanchers;Jerry;Okay, so let me get this straight. For the rest of your lives, no matter how much it hurts you, no matter how much it destroys our children's futures, we're gonna do whatever Rick wants, whenever he wants?
2;10;The Wedding Squanchers;All but Jerry;Yes.
2;10;The Wedding Squanchers;Jerry;WHY?!
2;10;The Wedding Squanchers;Beth;Because I don't want him to leave again, you dumb asshole!
2;10;The Wedding Squanchers;Rick;Hey, uh, I was gonna hop over to the Gloppydrop System, get some ice cream.
2;10;The Wedding Squanchers;Morty;You... You want me to come with? I mean, don't you need my brainwaves for camouflage or something?
2;10;The Wedding Squanchers;Rick;I'll be okay. Bye, Morty.
2;10;The Wedding Squanchers;Morty;Rick? You're not leaving, right?
2;10;The Wedding Squanchers;Rick;Yeah, I am. To get ice cream.
2;10;The Wedding Squanchers;Morty;So you're coming back?
2;10;The Wedding Squanchers;Rick;Morty, if you go to where there’s a bunch of ice cream and then you don’t come back, you haven’t actually gotten ice cream, you’ve just gone where ice cream is.
2;10;The Wedding Squanchers;Morty;Rick, I can handle it if you go, but you'll break mom's heart, and I won't forgive you for that.
2;10;The Wedding Squanchers;Rick;Where's the van, Morty?
2;10;The Wedding Squanchers;Morty;It's over the horizon in the driveway.
2;10;The Wedding Squanchers;Operator; For English, press 2.  Connecting to agent.
2;10;The Wedding Squanchers;Female Voice;Ongoing investigations.
2;10;The Wedding Squanchers;Rick;Uh, hi. My name is Jerry Smith, I'm from Planet Earth. I know the whereabouts of Rick Sanchez, the wanted criminal.
2;10;The Wedding Squanchers;Female Voice;Hold on!
2;10;The Wedding Squanchers;Gribbles;This is Special Agent Gribbles. You have a tip about Rick Sanchez?
2;10;The Wedding Squanchers;Rick;Yeah, he kidnapped me and my family, and he left us on Dwarf Terrace-9. He said he was gonna go to the Plim Plom Tavern. And listen.
2;10;The Wedding Squanchers;Gribbles;Yes?
2;10;The Wedding Squanchers;Rick;I'm doing what's right for the galaxy by calling you, so if we come back to Earth, can my family have a normal life?
2;10;The Wedding Squanchers;Gribbles;We only want Sanchez, sir. Your family will be fine.
2;10;The Wedding Squanchers;Rick;Nice, thank you. I'm Jerry Smith, and I love sucking big, sweaty boners and licking disgusting and furry testicle sacks.
2;10;The Wedding Squanchers;Gribbles;Uh, okay.
2;10;The Wedding Squanchers;Beth;He's not coming back, isn't he?
2;10;The Wedding Squanchers;Morty;No.
2;10;The Wedding Squanchers;Jerry;Hey look, cops!
2;10;The Wedding Squanchers;Gromflomite officer;Good morning.
2;10;The Wedding Squanchers;Prison Photography Cyborg;Sorry. I am not staring at you, I'm taking your mugshot. 
2;10;The Wedding Squanchers;Zerillian prisoner;Hey, what are you in for?
2;10;The Wedding Squanchers;Rick;Everything.
