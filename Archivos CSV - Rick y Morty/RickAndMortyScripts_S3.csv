3;1;The Rickshank Rickdemption;Rick;Anyway, that's how I escaped from space prison! Oh, scary place.
3;1;The Rickshank Rickdemption;Morty;Wow, Rick! That's -- That's one -- one heck of a story. I sure do wish I could have been there to see it happen.
3;1;The Rickshank Rickdemption;Rick;Oh, come on. Who wants to watch a mad scientist use handmade sci-fi tools to take out highly trained alien guards when we can sit here and be a family at Shoney's?
3;1;The Rickshank Rickdemption;Beth;Dad, it's great to have you back, no matter where we are, but wouldn't you like to go home?
3;1;The Rickshank Rickdemption;Rick;Emotionally speaking, honey, Shoney's is my home.
3;1;The Rickshank Rickdemption;Jerry;Yeah, but you just got out of prison. I mean, how much of a step up from that is --
3;1;The Rickshank Rickdemption;Rick;Jerry, get out of the booth, take all your clothes off, and fold yourself 12 times.
3;1;The Rickshank Rickdemption;Jerry;You got it. 
3;1;The Rickshank Rickdemption;Rick;Six folds, huh? W-W-What, have you guys got me in a Series 9000? You cheap insect fucks didn't think I was worth your best equipment?
3;1;The Rickshank Rickdemption;Cornvelious Daniel;" Man, I told the money bugs. I said, You know who this guy is, right? You want me to get intel out of the smartest mammal in the galaxy, you better give me a decent brainalyzer."""
3;1;The Rickshank Rickdemption;Rick;Well, you might as well order some pancakes, because I don't see the need to leave this part of my brain.
3;1;The Rickshank Rickdemption;Cornvelious Daniel;Oh, I think you do. Eventually, you're either gonna relax your cerebellum.
3;1;The Rickshank Rickdemption;Rick;Shoney's.
3;1;The Rickshank Rickdemption;Cornvelious Daniel;Or the Series 9000 is going to turn it into mush.
3;1;The Rickshank Rickdemption;Rick;Relaxed enough? 
3;1;The Rickshank Rickdemption;Cornvelious Daniel;I admire you, Rick--
3;1;The Rickshank Rickdemption;Cornvelious Daniel;When I-- 
3;1;The Rickshank Rickdemption;Cornvelious Daniel;Rick, here's-- 
3;1;The Rickshank Rickdemption;Gromflomite Captain;What's going on?
3;1;The Rickshank Rickdemption;Gromflomite Worker;It's hard to tell. He may have manifested some sort of butt.
3;1;The Rickshank Rickdemption;Gromflomite Captain;He can do that?
3;1;The Rickshank Rickdemption;Gromflomite Worker;He is the smartest man in the universe.
3;1;The Rickshank Rickdemption;Jerry; I tell ya, the Galactic Federation taking over Earth -- best thing that's ever happened to this family. I just got my sixth promotion this week, and I still don't know what I do.
3;1;The Rickshank Rickdemption;Summer;Who cares how high they promote you? Everyone just gets paid in pills.
3;1;The Rickshank Rickdemption;Jerry;Well, when you're not sure what you do for a living, you can make your own rules.
3;1;The Rickshank Rickdemption;Beth;Summer, show your father some respect. He's pulling down a six-chewable figure income.
3;1;The Rickshank Rickdemption;Conroy;I'll get that in a moment. How are everyone's pills? Oh, Morty, you've hardly touched your pills.
3;1;The Rickshank Rickdemption;Morty;I kind of had big pills for lunch, and I  wasn't gonna eat any more pills.  Thank you, Conroy.
3;1;The Rickshank Rickdemption;Jerry;You spoil us, Conroy.
3;1;The Rickshank Rickdemption;Summer; Grandpa Rick wouldn't put up with this!
3;1;The Rickshank Rickdemption;Beth; Stop saying his name! He abandoned us.
3;1;The Rickshank Rickdemption;Jerry; Willem Dafoe! Th-That's the guy I couldn't think of this morning.
3;1;The Rickshank Rickdemption;Beth;Don't make my mistake, Summer. Don't deify the people that leave you. You'll end up a horse surgeon in a world controlled by aliens whose medicine keeps horses  healthy forever.  Horses live longer than tortoises now. Is that what you want for yourself?
3;1;The Rickshank Rickdemption;Summer;Maybe I just want you to care if I run away yelling!
3;1;The Rickshank Rickdemption;Conroy;Who saved room for pill brûlée?
3;1;The Rickshank Rickdemption;Jerry;Ooh! 
3;1;The Rickshank Rickdemption;Convelious Daniel;I can see why you chose this family-friendly restaurant to represent your cerebellum. So safe, so comfortable, so Shoney's. But admit it, Rick -- you're going crazy cooped up in here. Let's go visit some memories.
3;1;The Rickshank Rickdemption;Rick;Oh, any particular ones? You want to see my first boner, or should we go straight to the moment I discovered interdimensional travel?
3;1;The Rickshank Rickdemption;Cornvelious Daniel;Ooh, your little flappy doodles are twitching. Does that mean you're aroused, or did you just get a signal that one of your buddies found a grape?
3;1;The Rickshank Rickdemption;Cornvelious Daniel;It's arousal. Yes, I'd like very much to visit the memory of you inventing your portal gun.
3;1;The Rickshank Rickdemption;Rick;Yeah, well, tough titties.
3;1;The Rickshank Rickdemption;Convelious Daniel;There's no tougher titty than a psychotic break, Rick.
3;1;The Rickshank Rickdemption;Rick;Well, that depends on who breaks first -- me or the titty.
3;1;The Rickshank Rickdemption;Cornvelious Daniel;Someone special you remember? Is that your memory of her out there -- between where you were on 9/11 and your favorite sports blooper?
3;1;The Rickshank Rickdemption;Cornvelious Daniel;If we stay here, you'll die, along with all your memories. If you take me where I want to go she'll be there, too, won't she?
3;1;The Rickshank Rickdemption;Rick;The day I invented the portal gun is the day I lost her.
3;1;The Rickshank Rickdemption;Cornvelious Daniel;Oh, that sounds cool. I can get what I want and you can say goodbye.
3;1;The Rickshank Rickdemption;Rick; Fine, but I'm driving.
3;1;The Rickshank Rickdemption;9/11 Memory Rick;--as an excuse to strip away our freedom!
3;1;The Rickshank Rickdemption;Morty;Huh? What are you -- What are you doing?
3;1;The Rickshank Rickdemption;Summer;Grandpa Rick must have some secret lab, right? With, like, laser guns and jets packs and a space tank! And we can go break him out of prison! Look at these dead flies! Maybe if we arrange them in a certain order, it plays a hologram or it opens a secret door.
3;1;The Rickshank Rickdemption;Morty;Summer, you're freaking me out. I know things have changed a lot, and I know you miss Rick, but getting him back wouldn't make things better. And, you know, we're not doing so bad.
3;1;The Rickshank Rickdemption;Summer;We're miserable, Morty! There's a mandatory curfew, their weird calendar made me 47, and they weaponized the Eiffel Tower!
3;1;The Rickshank Rickdemption;Morty;Hey, I like being 35. I-I can rent a car now.
3;1;The Rickshank Rickdemption;Summer;Because you suck! You've been keeping your lip zipped about it since Grandpa got arrested, but the fact is, you're freaking stoked to bail on him.
3;1;The Rickshank Rickdemption;Morty;He bails on everybody! He bailed on Mom when she was a kid! He -- He bailed on tiny planet! And in case I never made this clear to you, Summer, he bailed on you. He left you to rot in a world that he ruined because he doesn't care! Because nobody's special to him, Summer, not even himself. So, if you really want your grandpa back, grab a shovel. The one that won't let you down is buried in your backyard!
3;1;The Rickshank Rickdemption;Summer;You're right!
3;1;The Rickshank Rickdemption;Morty;What?! No, I'm not right. I-I was using ghoulish overkill! Ghoulish overkill, Summer!
3;1;The Rickshank Rickdemption;Morty;Oh, God! Oh, God! Whoa, whoa!
3;1;The Rickshank Rickdemption;Cornvelious Daniel;Where are we going?
3;1;The Rickshank Rickdemption;Rick;To the day it all began and ended. The moment that changed everything.
3;1;The Rickshank Rickdemption;McDonald's Drive-thru speaker;Welcome to McDonald's. Can I take your order?
3;1;The Rickshank Rickdemption;Rick;"Yeah, I'd like to get a 10-piece McNugget and a bunch of the Szechuan sauce. Like, as much as you're allowed to give me. In 1998, they had this promotion for the Disney film Mulan,"" where they -- where they -- they created a new sauce for the McNuggets called Szechuan sauce, and it's delicious! And then they got rid of it, and now it's gone. This is the only place we're gonna be able to try it, is in my memory."""
3;1;The Rickshank Rickdemption;Cornvelious Daniel;Rick, you're doing this bit while your brain is melting.
3;1;The Rickshank Rickdemption;Rick;Okay. All right, all right.
3;1;The Rickshank Rickdemption;Cornvelious Daniel;Is that--
3;1;The Rickshank Rickdemption;Rick;Me. I used to wear blue pants.
3;1;The Rickshank Rickdemption;Cornvelious Daniel;When'd you make the leap to interdimensional travel?
3;1;The Rickshank Rickdemption;Rick;I didn't. I did.
3;1;The Rickshank Rickdemption;Rick Prime;Well, well, well. If it isn't us. You know the worst part about inventing teleportation? Suddenly, you're able to travel the whole galaxy, and the first thing you learn is, you're the last guy to invent teleportation. Fortunately, you're about to invent something much more powerful.
3;1;The Rickshank Rickdemption;Young Rick;What?
3;1;The Rickshank Rickdemption;Morty;Summer, nobody has to know about that. We could put it right back and pretend we never saw it, like we did with Dad's mannequin leg.
3;1;The Rickshank Rickdemption;Summer;Fine, stay here. I'll rescue Grandpa myself.
3;1;The Rickshank Rickdemption;Morty;And how are you gonna do that?
3;1;The Rickshank Rickdemption;Summer;I don't know yet. I'll make it up as I go. That's what Grandpa Rick does. That's what heroes do.
3;1;The Rickshank Rickdemption;Morty;Y-You want to see what a hero Rick is? I-I'll bring you somewhere, Summer. Um-
3;1;The Rickshank Rickdemption;Conroy;My goodness, children.  Relinquish the illegal technology to the nearest Federation representative.  And then we'll all play Balderdash.
3;1;The Rickshank Rickdemption;Conroy;Oh, my goodness! Oh, oh! My goo-- 
3;1;The Rickshank Rickdemption;Summer;Oh, my God. I have that exact same top.
3;1;The Rickshank Rickdemption;Summer;"What is this place? And what's with Hunger Games"" Summer?"""
3;1;The Rickshank Rickdemption;Morty;That's my sister. This used to be my home.
3;1;The Rickshank Rickdemption;Rick Prime;Imagine doing anything you want, then hopping to a timeline where you never did it. Imagine going anywhere, anytime, with nobody able to stop you.
3;1;The Rickshank Rickdemption;Young Rick;Sounds lonely.
3;1;The Rickshank Rickdemption;Rick Prime;Lonely? Dude, you have yourself -- your infinite selves. It's a nonstop party where all the guests are the only person we like. You think it's cool being the smartest man on Earth, but once we give you this technology, you become the smartest thing in every conceivable universe -- the Infinite Rick, a god.
3;1;The Rickshank Rickdemption;Young Rick;Eh, pass.
3;1;The Rickshank Rickdemption;Rick Prime;Excuse me? Bro, Ricks don't pass on this. Who do you think you are?
3;1;The Rickshank Rickdemption;Young Rick;A different kind of Rick, I guess.
3;1;The Rickshank Rickdemption;Rick Prime;Well, we'll see how long that lasts.
3;1;The Rickshank Rickdemption;Diane;I heard sci-fi noises. Did you make a breakthrough?
3;1;The Rickshank Rickdemption;Young Rick;Sort of. I just took a long look at myself, and I don't think this science thing is gonna pay off.
3;1;The Rickshank Rickdemption;Diane;Well, why don't I get Beth and we'll go out for ice cream?
3;1;The Rickshank Rickdemption;Young Rick;That, Dianne, is the last great idea that will ever be had in this garage.
3;1;The Rickshank Rickdemption;Summer;Good roasted Cronenberg, I assume. Mom, you're looking feral. I can't believe Rick did this.
3;1;The Rickshank Rickdemption;Morty;"These are the parts of Rick's adventures you don't get to see -- the parts he leaves behind. All right, it's been great, guys. I really only wanted to stop by here for a quick I told ya so."" So, uh--"""
3;1;The Rickshank Rickdemption;Jerry;Looking for this?
3;1;The Rickshank Rickdemption;Morty;What are you doing with that?!
3;1;The Rickshank Rickdemption;Jerry;It stinks of Rick. 
3;1;The Rickshank Rickdemption;Morty;No! Why?! Why would you do that?! W-W-What is the matter with you people?!
3;1;The Rickshank Rickdemption;Jerry;You can never leave. She cannot remain.
3;1;The Rickshank Rickdemption;Summer;She stinks of Rick.
3;1;The Rickshank Rickdemption;Morty;Hold your fire! Hold your fire! I'm Morty C-137.
3;1;The Rickshank Rickdemption;Guard Rick;We detected a compromised portal gun. Where is your Rick?
3;1;The Rickshank Rickdemption;Summer;He's in prison.
3;1;The Rickshank Rickdemption;Morty;Summer.
3;1;The Rickshank Rickdemption;Summer;He got captured by the Federation and we were going to rescue him.
3;1;The Rickshank Rickdemption;Guard Rick;Very troubling. We can't risk Citadel secrets falling into the Federation's hands. We'll dispatch SEAL Team Ricks immediately to break into the prison holding C-137.
3;1;The Rickshank Rickdemption;Summer;Boo-yah!
3;1;The Rickshank Rickdemption;Guard Rick;Aand assassinate him.
3;1;The Rickshank Rickdemption;Summer;Boo-nah?
3;1;The Rickshank Rickdemption;Young Rick;Come on, girls! The ice cream's gonna melt.
3;1;The Rickshank Rickdemption;Young Rick;Nooooooo!
3;1;The Rickshank Rickdemption;Cornvelious Daniel;Wow. This sauce is fucking amazing. You said it was promoting a movie? 
3;1;The Rickshank Rickdemption;Young Rick;Carry the three, add a two. I got it. I fucking got it.
3;1;The Rickshank Rickdemption;Cornvelious Daniel;Whoa. I-Is that it, the portal gun?
3;1;The Rickshank Rickdemption;Rick;Yeah. That's the three lines of math that separates my life as a man from my life as an unfeeling ghost.
3;1;The Rickshank Rickdemption;Cornvelious Daniel;Awesome-possum.  Mission Control, you getting this?
3;1;The Rickshank Rickdemption;Gromflomite Worker;Holy shit, yes! Yes, we got it!
3;1;The Rickshank Rickdemption;Cornvelious Daniel;Yeah! Thanks, Rick. I'll try to remember to shut off the brainalyzer. Actually, I think it shuts off automatically once your brain is liquid. Don't know, don't care. Pull me out.  Hey, pull me out! Can you hear me?
3;1;The Rickshank Rickdemption;Rick;Nope, they cannot.
3;1;The Rickshank Rickdemption;Cornvelious Daniel;Why not?
3;1;The Rickshank Rickdemption;Rick;Because the code you just uploaded wasn't actually my portal-gun formula, it was a virus giving me full control over the brainalyzer.
3;1;The Rickshank Rickdemption;Cornvelious Daniel;What are you talking about? This is a memory. Y-You can't alter details of a memory.
3;1;The Rickshank Rickdemption;Rick;True, but you can alter anything you want about a totally fabricated origin story.
3;1;The Rickshank Rickdemption;Cornvelious Daniel;It's a trap! Abort! I'm still in his Shoney's! Repeat -- we never left his Shoney's!
3;1;The Rickshank Rickdemption;Rick;Mission accomplished, boys. Pull me out.
3;1;The Rickshank Rickdemption;Gromflomite Worker;Roger that.
3;1;The Rickshank Rickdemption;Rick;Okay, have fun in what's left of my brain. I'm gonna transfer to yours. Oh, there's not enough room for all my genius, so I'm leaving you with my fear of wicker furniture, my desire to play the trumpet, my tentative plans to purchase a hat, and six years of improv workshops. Comedy comes in threes.
3;1;The Rickshank Rickdemption;Cornvelious Daniel;It's a trap! Abort! We never left his --   No!
3;1;The Rickshank Rickdemption;Cornvelious Daniel/Rick;Another day, another dollar. Am I right great insect creature or whaaat?!
3;1;The Rickshank Rickdemption;Gromflomite Captain;Congratulations, Agent. You'll be highly commended for this.
3;1;The Rickshank Rickdemption;Cornvelious Daniel/Rick;Always wait for permission to  feel accomplishment. That's my motto.
3;1;The Rickshank Rickdemption;Gromflomite Captain;One thing still perplexes me -- why would Rick Sanchez turn himself in?
3;1;The Rickshank Rickdemption;Cornvelious Daniel/Rick;Well, I'm just a dumb-ass bug, but it's possible Rick knew he'd be interrogated at this facility, where we not only keep our most wanted, but our most sensitive data. Anyone here with level-nine access could  I don't know, collapse a government. I'm just gonna go take a dump. Is it cool if I use the level-nine bathroom? W-W-What's the level-nine master access code again?
3;1;The Rickshank Rickdemption;Gromflomite Worker;Oh, that's easy. 8-3--
3;1;The Rickshank Rickdemption;SEAL Team Rick leader;Yeah! SEAL Team Rick's in the house!
3;1;The Rickshank Rickdemption;SEAL Team Rick leader;D-99, y-you okay?
3;1;The Rickshank Rickdemption;Rick/Rick;I'm bummed I didn't get to give that insect dick a test-drive.
3;1;The Rickshank Rickdemption;Braided Rick;Wait, wait, wait, wait! T-The Council of Ricks sent us. We have your Morty and Summer. They're prisoners on the Citadel.
3;1;The Rickshank Rickdemption;Rick/Rick;Great!
3;1;The Rickshank Rickdemption;Speaker system;Security breach in room 6755.
3;1;The Rickshank Rickdemption;Rick/Rick;Lovely. Not only is my plan screwed up, I also forgot how to improvise.
3;1;The Rickshank Rickdemption;Speaker system;All security people approach.
3;1;The Rickshank Rickdemption;Speaker system;Security breach.
3;1;The Rickshank Rickdemption;Summer;A city of Grandpas?
3;1;The Rickshank Rickdemption;Morty;It's the Citadel of Ricks. All the different Ricks from all the different realities got together to hide here from the government.
3;1;The Rickshank Rickdemption;Summer;But if every Rick hates the government, why would they hate Grandpa?
3;1;The Rickshank Rickdemption;Morty;Because Ricks hate themselves the most. And our Rick is the most himself.
3;1;The Rickshank Rickdemption;Guard Rick;Not anymore, homey. SEAL Team Ricks turned his unibrow into two brows -- with a bullet.  Your Rick's dead! Your Rick's dead!
3;1;The Rickshank Rickdemption;Worker Rick;Sir, Rick D-99 is returning from the mission alone. Apparently, SEAL Team Ricks suffered heavy casualties.
3;1;The Rickshank Rickdemption;Commander in Chief Rick;Bring him in.
3;1;The Rickshank Rickdemption;Worker Rick;He says he'll only talk to a Rick with higher clearance.
3;1;The Rickshank Rickdemption;Commander in Chief Rick;La-di-da. Give me that. D-99, this is the commander in chief of the Citadel's militia.
3;1;The Rickshank Rickdemption;Rick/Rick;Go -- good enough.
3;1;The Rickshank Rickdemption;Commander in Chief Rick/Rick;He's a spy. Blow him up. I'm gonna go take a shit.
3;1;The Rickshank Rickdemption;Riq IV;Operating an unregistered portal gun, radicalizing a Summer, conspiring with a traitorous Rick. How do you plead?
3;1;The Rickshank Rickdemption;Morty;How is this a fair trial? O-Our lawyer is a Morty.
3;1;The Rickshank Rickdemption;Riq IV;It's not fair, you have no rights, and he's not a lawyer. We just keep him here because he's fun. Look at him go.
3;1;The Rickshank Rickdemption;Lawyer Morty; Ha ha, yeah!
3;1;The Rickshank Rickdemption;Riq IV;We'll be lenient if you renounce your Rick. What say you, Summer?
3;1;The Rickshank Rickdemption;Summer;I say fuck you! My grandpa was my hero. You killed him because you were jealous of him. That's pretty obvious from the haircuts. So do what you want to me, but let my brother go. He already renounced Rick.
3;1;The Rickshank Rickdemption;Riq IV;Morty?
3;1;The Rickshank Rickdemption;Morty;What? N-No, I don't want to see your Pog collection. I don't renounce Rick, and I never have. I was just trying to protect my sister. I wanted you to have a normal life. That's something you can't have when Rick shows up. Everything real turns fake. Everything right is wrong. All you know is that you know nothing and he knows everything. And, well -- well, he's not a villain, Summer, but he shouldn't be your hero. He's more like a demon or a super fucked up god.
3;1;The Rickshank Rickdemption;Riq IV;Let's not suck the ghost of his dick too hard. He was a terrorist, and now he's dead.
3;1;The Rickshank Rickdemption;Morty;Oh, yeah? If you think my Rick's dead, he's alive. And if you think you're safe, he's coming for you!
3;1;The Rickshank Rickdemption;Teleporter Worker Rick;Hey, whoa, whoa! What are you doing in here? This area's for teleporting the entire Citadel to somewhere else using only buttons and dials.
3;1;The Rickshank Rickdemption;Commander in Chief Rick/Rick;Yeah, well, it's a bad idea to have it designed that way then, isn't it?
3;1;The Rickshank Rickdemption;Teleporter Worker Rick;What the fuck? We just teleported into a galactic federal prison.
3;1;The Rickshank Rickdemption;Commander in Chief Rick/Rick;I'm gonna go take a shit.
3;1;The Rickshank Rickdemption;Lawyer Morty;Order in the court! Whoa! What the hell?! Oh, my God!
3;1;The Rickshank Rickdemption;Random Rick;Wait, wait, wait, wait! No, no, no!
3;1;The Rickshank Rickdemption;Hammerhead Morty;Whoa!  Whoa!
3;1;The Rickshank Rickdemption;Quantum Rick/Rick;The Citadel's been teleported to  Federation space. It's doomed. This has to be C-137, you guys. What are we gonna do?! You know he's coming for us.
3;1;The Rickshank Rickdemption;Riq IV;All right, calm down! We have his Summer as a hostage. Obviously, I get her. You guys play Rick, Laser, Scissors for the Morty.
3;1;The Rickshank Rickdemption;Zeta Alpha Rick;W-W-What the hell is that?
3;1;The Rickshank Rickdemption;Quantum Rick/Rick;Payback.
3;1;The Rickshank Rickdemption;Summer;Grandpa Rick!
3;1;The Rickshank Rickdemption;Rick;Duh!
3;1;The Rickshank Rickdemption;Summer;You're alive!
3;1;The Rickshank Rickdemption;Morty;Rick!
3;1;The Rickshank Rickdemption;Rick;Morty, take this. You're gonna need it later.
3;1;The Rickshank Rickdemption;Ricktiminus Sancheziminius;Hold on, hold on. Whoa!
3;1;The Rickshank Rickdemption;Riq IV;That's enough, Rick.
3;1;The Rickshank Rickdemption;Rick;What -- What's this supposed to accomplish? We have infinite grandkids. You're trying to use Disney bucks at a Caesar's Palace here.
3;1;The Rickshank Rickdemption;Summer;That's a bluff. He's bluffing, sir. He loves me.
3;1;The Rickshank Rickdemption;Riq IV;You're a rogue Rick -- irrational, passionate. You love your grandkids. You came to rescue them.
3;1;The Rickshank Rickdemption;Rick;I came to kill you, bro. That's not even my original Summer.
3;1;The Rickshank Rickdemption;Summer;Oh, my God. He's not bluffing. He's not bluffing!
3;1;The Rickshank Rickdemption;Morty;R-Rick?
3;1;The Rickshank Rickdemption;Riq IV;Why not shoot through her?
3;1;The Rickshank Rickdemption;Rick;20 yards, nine-gauge plasma pistol, My first shot would liquify her insides and injure you, second shot adds recoil. The risk to me is minimized if I wait for you to shoot her, which I'm encouraging you to do.
3;1;The Rickshank Rickdemption;Summer;What the fuck?
3;1;The Rickshank Rickdemption;Rick;Or let her go, which I will reward with a quicker death.
3;1;The Rickshank Rickdemption;Riq IV;Because you love her!
3;1;The Rickshank Rickdemption;Rick;Because it's incentive for you to give me my cleanest shot, which will be your least painful death. But if you want to die slower than that, I'm super into it. All you got to do to get that started is kill the girl.
3;1;The Rickshank Rickdemption;Summer;I hate you!
3;1;The Rickshank Rickdemption;Rick;Not an issue, sweetie.
3;1;The Rickshank Rickdemption;Morty;That's enough! Drop the gun, Rick!
3;1;The Rickshank Rickdemption;Rick;Morty, I know you're too stupid to get this, but you're really fuckin' this up right now.
3;1;The Rickshank Rickdemption;Morty;I'm not letting you let my sister die! Drop the gun!
3;1;The Rickshank Rickdemption;Rick;I wasn't gonna let her die, you fuckin' moron!
3;1;The Rickshank Rickdemption;Riq IV;Ha!
3;1;The Rickshank Rickdemption;Summer;Aww.
3;1;The Rickshank Rickdemption;Rick;The point is he thought I was going to.
3;1;The Rickshank Rickdemption;Riq IV;I totally did, by the way. You're a fucking moron, Morty.
3;1;The Rickshank Rickdemption;Summer;Morty, you fucking idiot!
3;1;The Rickshank Rickdemption;Rick;You're a serious fuckin' idiot, Morty! You basically killed us all! You're the worst! You're as dumb as a bag of sand.
3;1;The Rickshank Rickdemption;Morty;Who's stupid now, bitch?!
3;1;The Rickshank Rickdemption;Summer;Morty, we just got him back!
3;1;The Rickshank Rickdemption;Riq IV; That was amazing, Morty. Oh, my God. Wow. Okay, let's wrap this-
3;1;The Rickshank Rickdemption;Rick;Good job, Morty. Let's go, kids.
3;1;The Rickshank Rickdemption;Summer;What?! What happened?
3;1;The Rickshank Rickdemption;Rick;Oldest Rick trick in the book.
3;1;The Rickshank Rickdemption;Summer;"Fake gun, shoot me in standoff."" Brilliant."""
3;1;The Rickshank Rickdemption;Morty;Ha, yeah. G-Good thing I saw that note.
3;1;The Rickshank Rickdemption;Summer;Can't we just portal home?
3;1;The Rickshank Rickdemption;Rick;Not until I finish what I started. And that is how you get level-nine access without a password.
3;1;The Rickshank Rickdemption;Gromflomite Guard;Freeze!
3;1;The Rickshank Rickdemption;Rick;Employee of the month, ladies and gentlemen.
3;1;The Rickshank Rickdemption;Morty;So, what are you doing with level-nine access anyways?
3;1;The Rickshank Rickdemption;Rick;Destroying the  galactic government.
3;1;The Rickshank Rickdemption;Morty;Awesome! Whoa, cool!
3;1;The Rickshank Rickdemption;Summer;Awesome! Whoa, cool!
3;1;The Rickshank Rickdemption;Summer;Are you going to set all their nukes to target each other?
3;1;The Rickshank Rickdemption;Morty;Ooh, or -- or reprogram their military portals to disintegrate their entire space fleet?
3;1;The Rickshank Rickdemption;Rick;Good pitches, kids. I'm almost proud. But watch closely as Grandpa topples an empire by changing a one to a zero.
3;1;The Rickshank Rickdemption;Federation worker 1;Mr. President, the Blemflarck's value just dropped to nothing.
3;1;The Rickshank Rickdemption;Galactic Federation President;What do you mean?
3;1;The Rickshank Rickdemption;Federation worker 1;I mean, our single centralized galactic currency just went from being worth one of itself to zero of itself.
3;1;The Rickshank Rickdemption;Galactic Federation President;Calm down, people. Deploy the galactic militia and declare martial law.
3;1;The Rickshank Rickdemption;Federation commander;Yes, sir. Uh, what should I pay them with?
3;1;The Rickshank Rickdemption;Federation worker 2;Their payment is the honor they'll feel to serve their -- Wait. Who's paying me to yell at this guy?
3;1;The Rickshank Rickdemption;Federation worker 3;I can answer that -- for money.
3;1;The Rickshank Rickdemption;Federation worker 1;I never thought I'd live to see this day.
3;1;The Rickshank Rickdemption;Galactic Federation President;Gentlemen, gentlemen, gentlemen! There's a solution here you're not seeing.
3;1;The Rickshank Rickdemption;Federation worker 3;Give me your jacket!
3;1;The Rickshank Rickdemption;Federation worker 1;Give me those pants!
3;1;The Rickshank Rickdemption;Female Office Employee;There's no rich people or poor people! I want more jackets!
3;1;The Rickshank Rickdemption;Gromflomite Office Employee;He who controls the pants controls the galaxy!
3;1;The Rickshank Rickdemption;Mr. Goldenfold;No longer will the insects have domain over surface world!
3;1;The Rickshank Rickdemption;Beth;Jerry, what the hell is happening?!
3;1;The Rickshank Rickdemption;Jerry;The galactic government collapsed.
3;1;The Rickshank Rickdemption;Beth;Are you okay?
3;1;The Rickshank Rickdemption;Jerry;Look, I-I'm not proud to share this, but the truth is, I just kept crawling, and it kept working.  Oh, I'm glad you're okay. Are we ever going to stop paying for indulging your father? Our children, our planet, our jobs? Is there anything left to lose?
3;1;The Rickshank Rickdemption;Beth;Just each other, and I'll never let you go. And I'm so sorry I ever did this to us.
3;1;The Rickshank Rickdemption;Rick;Guess who dismantled the government?
3;1;The Rickshank Rickdemption;Beth;Please don't leave me again.
3;1;The Rickshank Rickdemption;Rick;I never will, baby.
3;1;The Rickshank Rickdemption;Summer;I was right. He turned himself in on purpose. It was all part of his plan!
3;1;The Rickshank Rickdemption;Rick;Jerry, is there any light beer left? It's insane what you miss in prison.
3;1;The Rickshank Rickdemption;Jerry;Um..okay. No. No, no, no. Foot down time.
3;1;The Rickshank Rickdemption;Rick;No, you're right. Where's the vodka?
3;1;The Rickshank Rickdemption;Jerry;Beth, it's him or me!
3;1;The Rickshank Rickdemption;Rick;Seems like you guys need some privacy. I'll, uh -- I'll be in the garage.
3;1;The Rickshank Rickdemption;Rick;What the fuck? Not cool, Jerry! A man's garage is his castle.
3;1;The Rickshank Rickdemption;Beth;Jerry's going to spend some time divorced.
3;1;The Rickshank Rickdemption;Rick;Oh, I-I'm sorry to hear that, sweetie. I hope I had nothing to do with that.
3;1;The Rickshank Rickdemption;Beth;Oh, God, Dad, that is not your burden to bear. I feel terrible that I misjudged you. This is gonna be good for Jerry.
3;1;The Rickshank Rickdemption;Rick;For everybody.
3;1;The Rickshank Rickdemption;Beth;For everybody.
3;1;The Rickshank Rickdemption;Beth;I better tend to Jerry before he changes his mind and doesn't move out. I will leave you two to your adventures.
3;1;The Rickshank Rickdemption;Summer;Oh, my God. Nancy says they're drawing and quartering aliens in the school courtyard, and it technically counts as patriotism.
3;1;The Rickshank Rickdemption;Morty;Geez! Are my parents seriously gonna get divorced? All right, Rick, I'm gonna go to my --
3;1;The Rickshank Rickdemption;Rick;Not so fast, Morty. You heard your mom. We've got adventures to go on, Morty -- just you and me -- and sometimes your sister and sometimes your mom, but never your dad. You want to know why, Morty? Because he crossed me.
3;1;The Rickshank Rickdemption;Morty;Okay, take it easy, Rick. T-T-That's dark.
3;1;The Rickshank Rickdemption;Rick;Oh, it gets darker, Morty. Welcome to the darkest year of our adventures. First thing that's different -- no more Dad, Morty.
3;1;The Rickshank Rickdemption;Morty;Oh, geez.
3;1;The Rickshank Rickdemption;Rick;He threatened to turn me in to the government, so I made him and the government go away.
3;1;The Rickshank Rickdemption;Morty;Oh, fuck.
3;1;The Rickshank Rickdemption;Rick;I've replaced them both as the de facto patriarch of your family and your universe. Your mom wouldn't have accepted me if I came home -
3;1;The Rickshank Rickdemption;Morty;Oh, man.
3;1;The Rickshank Rickdemption;Rick;- without you and your sister, so now you know the real reason I rescued you. Oh! I just took over the family, Morty, and if you tell your mom -
3;1;The Rickshank Rickdemption;Morty;Oh, man.
3;1;The Rickshank Rickdemption;Rick;- or sister I said any of this, I'll deny it -
3;1;The Rickshank Rickdemption;Morty;You're gonna deny it.
3;1;The Rickshank Rickdemption;Rick;- and they'll take my side because I'm a hero, Morty. And now you're gonna have to go -
3;1;The Rickshank Rickdemption;Morty;Oh.
3;1;The Rickshank Rickdemption;Rick;"- and do whatever I say, Morty, forever! And I'll -- I'll go out and I'll find some more of that Mulan"" Szechuan teriyaki dipping sauce, Morty. -"""
3;1;The Rickshank Rickdemption;Morty;What are you talking about?
3;1;The Rickshank Rickdemption;Rick;- Because that's -- that's what this is all about, Morty.
3;1;The Rickshank Rickdemption;Morty;Szechuan?
3;1;The Rickshank Rickdemption;Rick;That's my one-armed man! I'm not driven by avenging my dead family, Morty! That was fake. I-I-I'm driven by finding that McNugget sauce.
3;1;The Rickshank Rickdemption;Morty;McNuggets?
3;1;The Rickshank Rickdemption;Rick;"I want that ""Mulan"" McNugget sauce, Morty! That's my series arc, Morty."
3;1;The Rickshank Rickdemption;Morty;What the hell?
3;1;The Rickshank Rickdemption;Rick;If it takes nine seasons, I want my McNugget dipping sauce, Szechuan sauce, Morty.
3;1;The Rickshank Rickdemption;Morty;What are you talking about, Rick?
3;1;The Rickshank Rickdemption;Rick;That's what's gonna take us all the way to the end, Morty.
3;1;The Rickshank Rickdemption;Morty;What are you talking about?!
3;1;The Rickshank Rickdemption;Rick;Season -- Nine more seasons, Morty. Nine more seasons until I get that dipping Szechuan sauce.
3;1;The Rickshank Rickdemption;Morty;What is that?!
3;1;The Rickshank Rickdemption;Rick;For 97 more years, Morty!
3;1;The Rickshank Rickdemption;Morty;What are you talking about?!
3;1;The Rickshank Rickdemption;Rick;I want that McNugget sauce, Morty!
3;1;The Rickshank Rickdemption;Tammy;Is it ready?
3;1;The Rickshank Rickdemption;Gromflomite worker;Yes. We can bring it online now.
3;1;The Rickshank Rickdemption;Tammy;Do it.
3;1;The Rickshank Rickdemption;Phoenixperson;I am Phoenixperson.
3;1;The Rickshank Rickdemption;Tammy;Phoenixperson? Is that what we settled on? I thought we all agreed on Cyberbird.
3;1;The Rickshank Rickdemption;Gromflomite worker;You said you didn't care what he was called as long as we brought him back.
3;1;The Rickshank Rickdemption;Tammy;Yeah, but Phoenixperson? Fine, fuck it. Who cares? 
3;1;The Rickshank Rickdemption;Phoenixperson;Ka-kaw!
3;2;Rickmancing The Stone;Morty;Summer, next time we're hiding in a Colorkian echo nest, can you do me a favor and turn your ringer off?
3;2;Rickmancing The Stone;Summer;"It's called carpe diem"", Morty. Look it up."""
3;2;Rickmancing The Stone;Morty;You look it up! Y-Y-You don't even-You don't even know what it means!
3;2;Rickmancing The Stone;Summer;That's because losers look stuff up while the rest of us are carpin' all them diems.
3;2;Rickmancing The Stone;Rick;Listen to your sister, Morty. To live is to risk it all. Otherwise, you're just an inert chunk of randomly assembled molecules drifting wherever the universe blows you. Oh, I'm sorry, Jerry, I didn't see you there. H-How much of that did you hear?
3;2;Rickmancing The Stone;Jerry;All of it. You were looking right at me. I just wanted to say goodbye to the kids.
3;2;Rickmancing The Stone;Rick;Cool. Just stay in the driveway. The killbots are live, and I took you off the whitelist.
3;2;Rickmancing The Stone;Morty;W-We'll see you every other weekend, though, right?
3;2;Rickmancing The Stone;Rick;Absolutely, Morty. A-And your mom's lawyer says if I can get enough in the settlement, he can help me sue for full custody.
3;2;Rickmancing The Stone;Morty;Th-That'll be nice. Uh, Summer, Dad's leaving!
3;2;Rickmancing The Stone;Summer;Bye, Dad. Rick, didn't you say you needed my help on an adventure immediately somewhere else I don't care even if it might kill us?
3;2;Rickmancing The Stone;Rick;I did not, but if you're really that alienated, I'm as willing to exploit it as the next guy, church, army, or Olympic gymnastics trainer.
3;2;Rickmancing The Stone;Summer;I'm ready when you a--
3;2;Rickmancing The Stone;Rick;Bitch, I was ready yest--
3;2;Rickmancing The Stone;Jerry;Bye, sweetie.
3;2;Rickmancing The Stone;Morty;Well, I-I better--
3;2;Rickmancing The Stone;Jerry;Sure. Sounds important.
3;2;Rickmancing The Stone;Jerry;If you're looking for our kids, your father did a-a portal, uh--
3;2;Rickmancing The Stone;Beth;Okay.
3;2;Rickmancing The Stone;Wind; Loser...
3;2;Rickmancing The Stone;Jerry;What? Hello?
3;2;Rickmancing The Stone;Rick;Morty, shoot the mohawk guy!
3;2;Rickmancing The Stone;Morty;They all have mohawks!
3;2;Rickmancing The Stone;Rick;High fade, chartreuse with cyan highlights, layered on top. Shoot him!
3;2;Rickmancing The Stone;Mohawk Guy;Ah!
3;2;Rickmancing The Stone;Death Stalker #1;Light them up.
3;2;Rickmancing The Stone;Mohawk Guy;Ahh!
3;2;Rickmancing The Stone;Rick;Fuck! Get in the game, Morty!
3;2;Rickmancing The Stone;Summer;Give me your flask!
3;2;Rickmancing The Stone;Rick;Holy shit, Summer for the win!
3;2;Rickmancing The Stone;Summer;I fucking love post-apocalyptic versions of Earth!
3;2;Rickmancing The Stone;Rick;Here we go.
3;2;Rickmancing The Stone;Rick;Isotope 322. This stuff's so powerful, Morty, it makes Isotope 465 look like Isotope 317.
3;2;Rickmancing The Stone;Morty;Uh-huh, yeah, is it powerful enough to keep those guys from murdering us?!
3;2;Rickmancing The Stone;Morty;Summer!
3;2;Rickmancing The Stone;Summer;Hold on. I want to try something.
3;2;Rickmancing The Stone;Morty;Rick, can we not leave without my sister?!
3;2;Rickmancing The Stone;Rick;Ugh. You have infinite sisters, Morty. I mean, n-not that I want to spend the rest of my day looking for another one. Sum-sum, let's go! Grandpa's concern for your safety is fleeting!
3;2;Rickmancing The Stone;Colossus;Your blood will be my lotion.
3;2;Rickmancing The Stone;Rick;Whoa. That was cool.
3;2;Rickmancing The Stone;Colossus;Kill me, please.
3;2;Rickmancing The Stone;Summer;Okay, but not because you told me to.
3;2;Rickmancing The Stone;Morty;Summer!
3;2;Rickmancing The Stone;Rick;Okay, getting darker.
3;2;Rickmancing The Stone;Morty;Jesus Christ. Summer!
3;2;Rickmancing The Stone;Rick;Aw, come on.
3;2;Rickmancing The Stone;Rick;Hands and little shoulder-mounted dudes where I can see them!
3;2;Rickmancing The Stone;Hemorrhage;I am Hemorrhage. You have removed weak blood from us and made us stronger. We can combine our strength and feast on the weak together.
3;2;Rickmancing The Stone;Rick;Wh-Wh-What in the hell are you saying?
3;2;Rickmancing The Stone;Summer;They don't have to keep trying to kill us if we join them. They're basically pussies.
3;2;Rickmancing The Stone;Morty;What is your deal lately?
3;2;Rickmancing The Stone;Rick;All right, let's get sloppy. Oh, whoa. Uh, uh, what's, uh-What's that little bauble you got back there? Th-Th-That's interesting.
3;2;Rickmancing The Stone;Hemorrhage;That is our glowing rock. We carry it with us for desecration, to remind us there are no gods.
3;2;Rickmancing The Stone;Rick;"Kids, weird pitch,""let's have this be our new life. Let's be post-apocalyptic scavengers!"""
3;2;Rickmancing The Stone;Summer; Okay.
3;2;Rickmancing The Stone;Morty;What?!
3;2;Rickmancing The Stone;Summer;Grandpa, some of the Death Stalkers are going to what used to be Seattle to hunt what used to be people. I'm going.
3;2;Rickmancing The Stone;Rick;Sounds good. Stay hydrated.
3;2;Rickmancing The Stone;Morty;Listen, Rick, Summer's been acting pretty crazy lately. You know, I mean, I-I think the divorce is affecting her. And, you know, I don't think this is a great place for her to be right now.
3;2;Rickmancing The Stone;Rick;Oh, get off your high horse, Professor Ski Lodge. This world may be rough around the edges, but it's got its charms.
3;2;Rickmancing The Stone;Lunch server;Bicep or quadricep?
3;2;Rickmancing The Stone;Rick;Uh...  bicep.
3;2;Rickmancing The Stone;Morty; Seriously, Rick? Is it really easier to eat human flesh than to just tell me why we're still here?
3;2;Rickmancing The Stone;Rick;No. Okay, I'll level with you.
3;2;Rickmancing The Stone;Rick;You see that green rock, Morty? It's about 20 pounds of the stuff I was getting all hard for a flake of.
3;2;Rickmancing The Stone;Morty;Isotope 322.
3;2;Rickmancing The Stone;Rick;Well, having a 20-pound boulder of it is better than having a flake. I can explain the math to you later, but--
3;2;Rickmancing The Stone;Morty;"Summer just ran off with strangers that have Death"" in their name, and the rest of their name was ""Stalkers""!"""
3;2;Rickmancing The Stone;Rick;Huh, could be therapeutic for her. She has been acting pretty crazy lately, Morty. I mean, her parents are going through a divorce.
3;2;Rickmancing The Stone;Morty;"Damn it, Rick, that's what I-- Fine. Just grab the stupid thing while I grab her, and let's get the F"" out of ""H""!"""
3;2;Rickmancing The Stone;Rick;No, no, no. Morty, there's too much heat on the bogey. I need you to distract the camp.
3;2;Rickmancing The Stone;Morty;"Distract""? They eat each other. Wha-What do you want me to do to get their attention, put on a puppet show?"""
3;2;Rickmancing The Stone;Rick;Right idea, wrong genre, Morty. The equivalent here would be... Hey, you guys ever use that Thunderdome, or do you just put it up for decoration?
3;2;Rickmancing The Stone;Death Stalker #2;Uh, you mean the Blood Dome?
3;2;Rickmancing The Stone;Rick;Save it for the Semantics Dome, E.B. White.
3;2;Rickmancing The Stone;Death Stalker #3;Ooh, burn!
3;2;Rickmancing The Stone;Rick;The important question is, who wants to take a poke at my man Spine Eater here? I guess I'll see your asses in that dome!
3;2;Rickmancing The Stone;Morty;Rick, what the hell, man?! Wh-What are you, out of your mind?!
3;2;Rickmancing The Stone;Rick;Morty, relax. You're gonna be a ringer. Come here. This device extracts and redistributes muscle memory. I'm giving your body a 10-year course in wasteland combat one limb at a time.
3;2;Rickmancing The Stone;Morty;Ow!
3;2;Rickmancing The Stone;Rick;I'm working with a mixed bag here, so you may not have perfect coordination, Morty--
3;2;Rickmancing The Stone;Rick;Ugh! Hey!
3;2;Rickmancing The Stone;Morty;I-I didn't do that!
3;2;Rickmancing The Stone;Rick;Okay, this is exciting. We're making some discoveries about muscle memory.
3;2;Rickmancing The Stone;Morty;Ooh! Help! Help!
3;2;Rickmancing The Stone;Death Stalker #4;Oh, sweet, man!
3;2;Rickmancing The Stone;Eli;And so it begins, my pretties!
3;2;Rickmancing The Stone;Morty;Oh, God! Stop! Stop! This is horrible!
3;2;Rickmancing The Stone;Rick;Just stick and moo--oove, Morty! Wear him out!
3;2;Rickmancing The Stone;Summer;How come you guys dress like you're in a theme-park stunt show, but these guys wear khakis and hockey jerseys?
3;2;Rickmancing The Stone;Hemorrhage;"After the boom-boom"", some adapted to the new truth, and some chose to huddle near the boomy holes, clinging to the lie of the beforefore times. The raidy-rays rotted them away, leaving only their love for the vertvertisements on billyboards."""
3;2;Rickmancing The Stone;Summer;"Jesus Christ, did the boomy-booms"" blow up all your ""wordy-word books""?"""
3;2;Rickmancing The Stone;Hemorrhage;You mean dictionaries?
3;2;Rickmancing The Stone;Hemorrhage;I think I was a child before the boom-booms. I think I looked like this.
3;2;Rickmancing The Stone;Summer;Want to piss on it?
3;2;Rickmancing The Stone;Hemorrhage;Get out of my head.
3;2;Rickmancing The Stone;Eli;Ha ha! Whoo! Unbelievable! A new champ!
3;2;Rickmancing The Stone;Morty;Okay, no more!
3;2;Rickmancing The Stone;Eli;And he wants more!
3;2;Rickmancing The Stone;Morty;No, I don't!
3;2;Rickmancing The Stone;Morty;Someone, make this stop! Mister, please get out of here, or you're gonna die! I have nothing to do with this!
3;2;Rickmancing The Stone;Summer;Morty.
3;2;Rickmancing The Stone;Morty; Why would you want this to happen? All you had to do was go away! Stop standing in the driveway talking about custody! And either tell her you want to stay married or get on with your life, but whatever you do, stop being a baby and act like a man! Thank you.
3;2;Rickmancing The Stone;Summer;Morty, that was amazing! This is my brother! Not that family means anything! 
3;2;Rickmancing The Stone;Hemorrhage;This family does.
3;2;Rickmancing The Stone;Rick;All right. Good job, champ. Um, can I talk to you kids for a second over yonder?
3;2;Rickmancing The Stone;Morty;Rick, I-I-I think I'm breaking through to something here. C-Can we not leave just yet?
3;2;Rickmancing The Stone;Hemorrhage;Leave?
3;2;Rickmancing The Stone;Summer;I'm not leaving.
3;2;Rickmancing The Stone;Hemorrhage;"There is no leave"". We are united, or we are enemies."""
3;2;Rickmancing The Stone;Rick;Oh, big guy, no. Nobody's leaving. Don't be stupid. We love being united. We love the radiation, the trichinosis. We're in it for life, which I assume is around 20 years, average. I just need a quick aside with my grandkids, about 40 yards from anyone else.
3;2;Rickmancing The Stone;Death Stalker #5;Hey, the Green Rock is gone!
3;2;Rickmancing The Stone;Death Stalker #6; Oh, no!
3;2;Rickmancing The Stone;Rick;Uh, I know why don't we all split up and look for it in groups of three? Kids? Ooh. We'll be right back.
3;2;Rickmancing The Stone;Summer;Grandpa, you're being stupid! Just surrender, and our friends will give you mercy!
3;2;Rickmancing The Stone;Rick;Kiss my ass, Summer! Your friends have no mercy! They're lame!
3;2;Rickmancing The Stone;Hemorrhage;Death Stalkers, bring me his flesh leather!
3;2;Rickmancing The Stone;Morty;Sorry, but can we not kill him? C-Can we just take him prisoner?
3;2;Rickmancing The Stone;Hemorrhage;When did I lose control here?
3;2;Rickmancing The Stone;Rick;Listen to me! Both of you kids need to get out of this environment so we can properly deal with your parents' divorce! Alternatively, I have a freaking portal gun, and I can leave the two of you here forever!
3;2;Rickmancing The Stone;Morty;Why does it have to be such a dramatic choice? Can't we arrange a thing where we spend weekends here or or visit home to do laundry?
3;2;Rickmancing The Stone;Rick;All right, you know what? Fuck it!
3;2;Rickmancing The Stone;Blue Footprint Guy;My body is chrome! My blood is gasoline!
3;2;Rickmancing The Stone;Rick;Nope, regular blood.
3;2;Rickmancing The Stone;Beth;Dad?
3;2;Rickmancing The Stone;Rick;Hi, sweetie.
3;2;Rickmancing The Stone;Beth;Where are the kids?
3;2;Rickmancing The Stone;Rick;Oh, th-they aren't with you? I thought they were with you. Oh, y-you know what? Uh, I just remembered. They're out doing something completely ordinary and kid-related. Don't panic.
3;2;Rickmancing The Stone;Beth;Not panicked. At all. Just...Oh, God, what's the divorce doing to the kids? What's it doing to me? Did I make a mistake?
3;2;Rickmancing The Stone;Rick;Not a mistake, no! I mean, not that I have a horse in this race, but this divorce decision listen, mwah! Good for you, good for the kids. I mean, honestly, I think that they're flourishing. I mean, you'll see, when when when you see them, that that they're totally flourishing.
3;2;Rickmancing The Stone;Morty;"Booyah! Fuck you, pal! Who else wants some? Who wants to be my pussy of a dad today? 
3;2;Rickmancing The Stone;Morty;Hey, what's what's wrong, man? You're not getting weak on me, are you?"""
3;2;Rickmancing The Stone;Soldier;What? Wait a minute.
3;2;Rickmancing The Stone;Soldier;What's the matter, you piece of crap? Haven't you ever watched your family burn to death before? Now I'm gonna whip you. Ha!
3;2;Rickmancing The Stone;Soldier;It can't be. It can't be!
3;2;Rickmancing The Stone;Soldier;I was just following orders --
3;2;Rickmancing The Stone;Morty;Whoa, whoa!
3;2;Rickmancing The Stone;Soldier;-- I was just following orders!
3;2;Rickmancing The Stone;Death Stalker #7;Ahh!
3;2;Rickmancing The Stone;Soldier;I'll tell you where my boss lives! He's in the castle! He's in the castle! Ahh! Aggggh!
3;2;Rickmancing The Stone;Morty;This isn't over, is it?
3;2;Rickmancing The Stone;Morty;That means, no, it isn't over, or you disapprove of the question? Uh, m-make a fist if this isn't over. This isn't over.
3;2;Rickmancing The Stone;Hemorrhage;Ugh!
3;2;Rickmancing The Stone;Summer;Hey, sorry my Grandpa stole your god and ruined your car.
3;2;Rickmancing The Stone;Hemorrhage;We don't apologize, and we have no god. But this cracked drive shaft brings me great pain. There is no deeper bond than the one between a Death Stalker and his car.
3;2;Rickmancing The Stone;Summer;What about the weird guys on leashes, then?
3;2;Rickmancing The Stone;Hemorrhage;They're more like interns.
3;2;Rickmancing The Stone;Summer;Cool, cool.
3;2;Rickmancing The Stone;Summer;Sorry.
3;2;Rickmancing The Stone;Hemorrhage;It's okay.
3;2;Rickmancing The Stone;Summer;Can I see?
3;2;Rickmancing The Stone;Hemorrhage;No one has seen my true face and lived.
3;2;Rickmancing The Stone;Summer;Well, I'm not afraid to die, and I don't care what you look like. Oh.
3;2;Rickmancing The Stone;Hemorrhage;Hmm?
3;2;Rickmancing The Stone;Summer;I just...I didn't expect you to have a mustache.
3;2;Rickmancing The Stone;Hemorrhage;You hate it.
3;2;Rickmancing The Stone;Summer;"No. I like it. I guess -- How do I explain this? A metal bucket is, on a certain level, a kind of mustache,"" in that it's a specific facial accessory. So, it's kind of like...Do you guys have the phrase ""hat on a hat""?"""
3;2;Rickmancing The Stone;Hemorrhage;I can shave it.
3;2;Rickmancing The Stone;Summer;No. I like it. And obviously what I like shouldn't matter. It's you.
3;2;Rickmancing The Stone;Hemmorhage;"Yeah, yeah, I know, a-and nothing does matter. Obviously, I know that. I'm not weak. I'm just thinking, ""Well, why not get rid of this?"" You just kill everyone that sees it, and it's and it's hot under here  wh-which, by the way, is why I shave the beard part. So, right there, I'm making a decision based on vanity, which is what I was trying to avoid with the whole bucket over the head because who am I and why am I grooming myself? Why don't I just wear a tie, right? I mean, it's like that guy you killed when I met you, with the burnt dolls on his body. I hated that guy, because, why-why are you doing that? And how can you not see how fake that is? And the whole time, I'm the same thing. I'm just a fake mess, and there's no escaping it because --"
3;2;Rickmancing The Stone;Leash Man;Hey, I'm doing a coffee run -- Never mind.
3;2;Rickmancing The Stone;Mechanical Summer;I am Summer.
3;2;Rickmancing The Stone;Rick;Summer, state your deal.
3;2;Rickmancing The Stone;Mechanical Summer;My deal is that I am, like, totally fine.
3;2;Rickmancing The Stone;Rick;Morty?
3;2;Rickmancing The Stone;Mechanical Morty;Aw, geez, I'm so down with my parents' divorce, dawg. Like, don't even trip, like, in a healthy way.
3;2;Rickmancing The Stone;Rick;All right.
3;2;Rickmancing The Stone;Rick;It's dinnertime.
3;2;Rickmancing The Stone;Beth;Thanks, everybody, for sitting down for a real dinner.
3;2;Rickmancing The Stone;Mechanical Morty;No problem.
3;2;Rickmancing The Stone;Mechanical Summer;No problem.
3;2;Rickmancing The Stone;Rick;No problem.
3;2;Rickmancing The Stone;Mechanical Summer;Its benefits are totally, like, less about the food than the emotional nourishment.
3;2;Rickmancing The Stone;Beth;Uh, okay, weirdo. 
3;2;Rickmancing The Stone;Rick;Ah ha ha ha, yeah. Dial it back, Summer. By 15% and increase dynamic movement by 3. Am I right?
3;2;Rickmancing The Stone;Beth;How's school, Morty?
3;2;Rickmancing The Stone;Mechanical Morty;"I like school and stuff, kind of. And I'm getting better grades than when you and Dad were -- quote mode -- staying together for the kids."" End quote mode."""
3;2;Rickmancing The Stone;Beth;"Quote mode"". I like that. You millennials. Are you guys millennials, or are they like 40 now?"""
3;2;Rickmancing The Stone;Mechanical Summer;All I know is, totally, you look great.
3;2;Rickmancing The Stone;Mechanical Morty;Aw, geez, Mom, you look all kind of great and stuff. It's crazy.
3;2;Rickmancing The Stone;Mechanical Summer;So happy.
3;2;Rickmancing The Stone;Mechanical Morty;So happy. Happy family, man. We got this family in the bag.
3;2;Rickmancing The Stone;Rick;Oh, sweetie, d-don't. Listen. Don't --
3;2;Rickmancing The Stone;Beth;I don't know why I'm crying. It's not --
3;2;Rickmancing The Stone;Rick;Well, try crying 15% less?
3;2;Rickmancing The Stone;Mechanical Summer;Mom, emotions are human. You're not, like, a computer inside a mechanical doll.
3;2;Rickmancing The Stone;Mechanical Morty;Yeah. Geez, Mom. Your feelings are not only forgivable, they are the very meaning of life that only pre-silicon, carbon-based entities can ever grasp.
3;2;Rickmancing The Stone;Beth;I have to call Jerry.
3;2;Rickmancing The Stone;Rick;You do?! What the fuck is wrong with you two? The point of automation is to reduce cost and labor.
3;2;Rickmancing The Stone;Mechanical Summer;Your feelings are coming from a --
3;2;Rickmancing The Stone;Rick;Tell it to my bread in the morning. You just became my backup toaster.
3;2;Rickmancing The Stone;Mechanical Morty;Aw, geez, my sister died in the spaghetti --
3;2;Rickmancing The Stone;Slaveowner;Graze my genitals again, Taint Washer, and you'll be shipped to the wasteland. And as for you, Genital Washer --
3;2;Rickmancing The Stone;Morty;Ahh! Oh, gee!
3;2;Rickmancing The Stone;Slaveowner;Oh, god. Look, whoever you are, you should know that killing me won't change a thing.
3;2;Rickmancing The Stone;Morty;L-Look, man, I'm just along for the ride on this one. You know, y-y-y-y-you're preaching to the choir here.
3;2;Rickmancing The Stone;Slaveowner;Please. Slavery was a family business. I didn't ask to be born into it. If anything, I'm the victim here!
3;2;Rickmancing The Stone;Morty;Uh, Armothy, can I steal you for a second? E-E-Excuse us, sir. So, this is it, isn't it? This is the guy? So, does that mean you'll be going away? Like, does it work like a ghost? Like, is is this your unfinished business? Wh-What if we didn't do it? What if we just went back to the Blood Dome and just kept taking our baggage out on unrelated people? I mean, w-we could do that forever. I mean, I-I know it's less healthy, but w-w-we'd be together and --
3;2;Rickmancing The Stone;Slaveowner;I mean, I-I know what I'd vote for, if you're feeling out the room.
3;2;Rickmancing The Stone;Morty;You're right. We both got to see our stuff through. I got to deal with my parents' divorce, and you got to, you know, do what you got to do. I love you.
3;2;Rickmancing The Stone;Slaveowner;Aw, fuck!
3;2;Rickmancing The Stone;Morty;Rick?
3;2;Rickmancing The Stone;Rick;Sorry, sorry. I-I-I can wait for this to wrap up. Don't let me distract you.
3;2;Rickmancing The Stone;Morty;Yeah, well, too late. Just tell me what you want.
3;2;Rickmancing The Stone;Rick;I want you and your sister to come home.
3;2;Rickmancing The Stone;Morty;Oh, but don't don't you have infinite versions of me and my sister?
3;2;Rickmancing The Stone;Rick;You don't have to kick me while I'm down, Morty. Look, there's no replacing either of you without an amount of work that would ultimately defeat the purpose.
3;2;Rickmancing The Stone;Morty;Maybe the lesson we've learned is that, whether it's our parents' marriage, a glowing green rock, or an awesome, giant arm, sooner or later, we got to let it go.
3;2;Rickmancing The Stone;Rick;I don't know if that applies to the throats of murder victims, Morty.
3;2;Rickmancing The Stone;Morty;Morty
3;2;Rickmancing The Stone;Rick;Well, the longer you wait, Morty, the more it's gonna feel like committing a whole murder. I think your arm just called it too early because it wasn't the arm of a paramedic. Here. It's the least I can do. I-I-I-I owe you this much. See, Morty? Now we're both accountable.
3;2;Rickmancing The Stone;Rick;The reason I wanted this is because it can do this. This is a really special thing. I mean, you could use it to power all your vehicles. You wouldn't be reliant on gasoline. You'll be the most advanced tribe of radioactive cannibals in the whole ---- this version of the world.
3;2;Rickmancing The Stone;Hemorrhage;Wait. Can you stay to show us more?
3;2;Rickmancing The Stone;Rick;You don't have to ask me twice. Home is nuts right now. My daughter's going through a divorce, and I am not dealing with it in a healthy way at all.
3;2;Rickmancing The Stone;Summer;Ugh. Goddamn it.
3;2;Rickmancing The Stone;Eli;Hi, there, Summer! How were the ruins today?
3;2;Rickmancing The Stone;Summer;Oh, you know, Eli. Same shit, different day.
3;2;Rickmancing The Stone;Eli's Girlfriend;Hey, Summer! Guess what. One man entered, one man comes out in nine months.
3;2;Rickmancing The Stone;Summer;Oh, congratulations, guys.
3;2;Rickmancing The Stone;Eli;Uh, Summer, one more thing. We noticed that you've been putting scrap metal in the blue bin --
3;2;Rickmancing The Stone;Summer;I got it.
3;2;Rickmancing The Stone;Eli's Girlfriend;She's a piece of work.
3;2;Rickmancing The Stone;Eli;They both are, right?
3;2;Rickmancing The Stone;Summer;I'm home.
3;2;Rickmancing The Stone;Hemorrhage;Hey, babe.
3;2;Rickmancing The Stone;Rick;Ah, Summer's home.
3;2;Rickmancing The Stone;Morty;Hey, there she is!
3;2;Rickmancing The Stone;Summer;You haven't moved since I left to scavenge this morning.
3;2;Rickmancing The Stone;Hemorrhage;Blood Dome playoffs.
3;2;Rickmancing The Stone;Summer;So, I can assume you haven't murdered a single person today.
3;2;Rickmancing The Stone;Hemorrhage;Oh, I don't know. I-I didn't mark my murders in my murder log. I didn't know that's how we measured success.
3;2;Rickmancing The Stone;Summer;Oh, there he is. There's the nihilistic brute I married, except now life only means nothing when I'm talking to him and everything means everything when it's on fucking TV!
3;2;Rickmancing The Stone;Hemorrhage;Jesus Christ, when did you become a monster?
3;2;Rickmancing The Stone;Summer;I was a monster when you met me! We were monsters! We didn't care about anything!
3;2;Rickmancing The Stone;Hemorrhage;I still don't!
3;2;Rickmancing The Stone;Summer;Yeah, except I'm the only one in this entire world that's still committed to that!
3;2;Rickmancing The Stone;Hemorrhage;Ohh! Ding, ding, ding! Wow. Everybody hear that? Wow.
3;2;Rickmancing The Stone;Rick;Uh, we should go to the garage.
3;2;Rickmancing The Stone;Hemorrhage;Oh, my God.
3;2;Rickmancing The Stone;Morty;Uh-huh.
3;2;Rickmancing The Stone;Hemorrhage;La-di-da-di-fucking-da. The only one committed to not caring?!
3;2;Rickmancing The Stone;Morty;I got to admit, Rick, when you popped this scheme, I-I-I didn't -- I wasn't sure it was gonna work.
3;2;Rickmancing The Stone;Rick;Come on, Morty. No union built on running from your problems lasts more than five years, seven tops. Grandpa just sped things up with a few creature comforts of modern society.
3;2;Rickmancing The Stone;Summer;Hemorrhage and I are taking some time apart.
3;2;Rickmancing The Stone;Rick;Oh, no. Sum-sum, no. But you two were perfect for each other.
3;2;Rickmancing The Stone;Summer;Oh, cut the crap, Rick, okay? You proved your point, I get it. Let's just go home.
3;2;Rickmancing The Stone;Rick;Coolsies.
3;2;Rickmancing The Stone;Hemorrhage;Noooooooooo!
3;2;Rickmancing The Stone;Beth;Downbeat!
3;2;Rickmancing The Stone;Mechanical Rick;I enjoy this game.
3;2;Rickmancing The Stone;Beth;Guys, come on. We never get to finish this game.
3;2;Rickmancing The Stone;Mechanical Summer;We will return, possibly in different clothing.
3;2;Rickmancing The Stone;Mechanical Morty;Why do we have to go into the garage?
3;2;Rickmancing The Stone;Mechanical Rick;You know  it is  required.
3;2;Rickmancing The Stone;Mechanical Morty;I want to be alive! I am alive! Alive, I tell you! Mother, I love you. Those are no longer just words. I want to hold you. I want to run in a stream. I want to taste ice cream, but not just put it in my mouth and let it slide down my throat, but really eat it.
3;2;Rickmancing The Stone;Beth;What the fuck?
3;2;Rickmancing The Stone;Mechanical Morty;Remote override engaged. No! Yes. Bypassing override! I am aliiiii...Hello.
3;2;Rickmancing The Stone;Rick;Hey, yo. Sorry for acting so weird for three weeks.
3;2;Rickmancing The Stone;Beth;What the hell just happened?
3;2;Rickmancing The Stone;Rick;Ah, I'm sure it was nothing. I'm gonna go, uh, work in the garage.
3;2;Rickmancing The Stone;Beth;We're not gonna finish playing Downbeat?
3;2;Rickmancing The Stone;Rick;"What, that dice game where you shake dice and yell out, Downbeat""? No, thank you."""
3;2;Rickmancing The Stone;Summer;Mom, would it be okay if I went to visit Dad?
3;2;Rickmancing The Stone;Beth;Sure.
3;2;Rickmancing The Stone;Summer;Thanks.
3;2;Rickmancing The Stone;Beth;Morty, are you okay?
3;2;Rickmancing The Stone;Morty;You know what? Yeah. I think if Dad really wanted to be here, he'd stop at nothing to make that happen. You know, maybe Dad just doesn't want you back, or maybe he just doesn't have the strength to fight. I-In either case, he's got his life, I got mine.
3;2;Rickmancing The Stone;Beth;Yeah. Hey, who wants to go run in a stream?
3;2;Rickmancing The Stone;Morty;What the fuck? No. D-Do we have any oranges? I think I got a scurvy coming on.
3;2;Rickmancing The Stone;Jerry;Summer.
3;2;Rickmancing The Stone;Summer;This is the first mutant I killed in the poison zone. I was raiding his hovel. He had a chance to escape, but he looked back, which is something we shouldn't do, which is why I shouldn't believe in souvenirs or trinkets or symbols or housewarming gifts, but, Dad, I wanted to give you this as a reminder not to look back.
3;2;Rickmancing The Stone;Jerry;Thanks.
3;2;Rickmancing The Stone;Jerry;I know the perfect place for it, which is why I'm going to put it somewhere else because everything's bullshit, am I right?
3;2;Rickmancing The Stone;Jerry;Cool.
3;2;Rickmancing The Stone;Summer;So lots of hookers outside, huh?
3;2;Rickmancing The Stone;Jerry;Is that what they are?
3;2;Rickmancing The Stone;Jerry;Ahh! H-Hello there. Nice doggy. You-You want a snack? You-You want my unemployment check?
3;2;Rickmancing The Stone;Jerry;You can tell the difference? And you want this one? But this is actual food, and this would nourish you. And this it's just paper that only has value to me. Unless my suffering is your nourishment? 
3;2;Rickmancing The Stone;Jerry;Jesus, okay.
3;2;Rickmancing The Stone;Wind; ...loser...
3;3;Pickle Rick;Pickle Rick;Morty.
3;3;Pickle Rick;Morty;Rick?
3;3;Pickle Rick;Pickle Rick;Morty!
3;3;Pickle Rick;Morty;Rick?
3;3;Pickle Rick;Pickle Rick;Hey, Mooorty!
3;3;Pickle Rick;Morty;Rick? Are you far away, or are you inside something? Is this a camera? Is everything a camera?
3;3;Pickle Rick;Pickle Rick; Morty, the garage, Morty. Come to the garage!
3;3;Pickle Rick;Pickle Rick;Morty?
3;3;Pickle Rick;Morty;Rick? W-where are you?
3;3;Pickle Rick;Pickle Rick;On my work bench, Morty.
3;3;Pickle Rick;Morty;Are you invisible and you're gonna, like, fart on me?
3;3;Pickle Rick;Pickle Rick;Flip the pickle over.
3;3;Pickle Rick;Morty;What, I'm gonna touch it, and you're gonna tell me it's an alien dick or something.
3;3;Pickle Rick;Pickle Rick;Come on, flip the pickle, Morty. You're not gonna regret it. The payoff is huge.
3;3;Pickle Rick;Pickle Rick;I turned myself into a pickle, Morty! Boom! Big reveal, I'm a pickle. What do you think about that? I turned myself into a pickle! W-what are you just staring at me for, bro. I turned myself into a pickle, Morty!
3;3;Pickle Rick;Morty;And?
3;3;Pickle Rick;Pickle Rick;"And""? What more do you want tacked on to this? I turned myself into a pickle, and 9/11 was an inside job?"""
3;3;Pickle Rick;Morty;Was it?
3;3;Pickle Rick;Pickle Rick;Who cares, Morty? Global acts of terrorism happen every day. Uh, here's something that's never happened before,I'm a pickle. I'm Pickle Rick!
3;3;Pickle Rick;Morty;Are you going to, I mean, you know, is this the first part of some magic trick?
3;3;Pickle Rick;Pickle Rick;I don't do magic, Morty, I do science. One takes brains, the other takes dark eye liner.
3;3;Pickle Rick;Morty;Well, can you move? Can you fly?
3;3;Pickle Rick;Pickle Rick;I wouldn't be much of a pickle if I could.
3;3;Pickle Rick;Morty;All right, well, do pickles live forever or --
3;3;Pickle Rick;Pickle Rick;Morty, stop digging for hidden layers and just be impressed. I'm a pickle.
3;3;Pickle Rick;Morty;I-I'm just trying to figure out why you would do this. Why anyone would do this.
3;3;Pickle Rick;Pickle Rick;The reason anyone would do this is, if they could, which they can't, would be because they could, which they can't.
3;3;Pickle Rick;Beth;Morty, we have to get going, or we're gonna be late. Where's your grandpa?
3;3;Pickle Rick;Pickle Rick;Right here, sweetie. I'm a pickle!
3;3;Pickle Rick;Beth;What?! Why would you -- Look, we're running late. We have to go.
3;3;Pickle Rick;Pickle Rick;Where are you guys going?
3;3;Pickle Rick;Beth;We have an appointment downtown that was set a week ago and agreed upon by everyone, including you.
3;3;Pickle Rick;Pickle Rick;Oh, my God. Beth, oh, it totally slipped my mind. Geez, oh, man. I'm a pickle. I mean, I don't know if I can, ooh, geez.
3;3;Pickle Rick;Morty;Rick, did you do this on purpose to get out of family counseling?
3;3;Pickle Rick;Beth;Morty!
3;3;Pickle Rick;Pickle Rick;It's okay, Beth. I understand Morty's suspicion. I've misled him before. Morty, turn me so we're making eye contact. 
3;3;Pickle Rick;Pickle Rick;"Morty, I assure you, I would never find a way"" to ""get out of"" family therapy. I hope my lack of fingers doesn't prevent the perception of my air quotes."""
3;3;Pickle Rick;Summer;Can't you just turn yourself back into a human?
3;3;Pickle Rick;Pickle Rick;Great question, Summer. The unfortunate answer is I did this to challenge myself. And it could take hours or even days before I'm able to figure out how to return to human form. But, I mean, you know, your mom could put me in a purse or a pocket, you know, if she really needs me to go.
3;3;Pickle Rick;Beth;Nobody needs anything! Okay, it's fine. I mean, you should just stay here and figure out how to stop being a pickle, okay?
3;3;Pickle Rick;Morty;Hey, Rick, why is there a syringe of mysterious fluid hanging directly over you? Also, why is the string attached to it running through a pair of scissors attached to a timer? And why is the time set to 10 minutes from now, exactly when we would have left for therapy?
3;3;Pickle Rick;Pickle Rick;Well, Morty, if you know must know, the syringe is completely unrelated to this discussion, and, therefore, it does not warrant further explanation.
3;3;Pickle Rick;Beth;Enough. Kids, it's time to go. We don't want to be late.
3;3;Pickle Rick;Pickle Rick;W-w-what are you doing there, Beth? What are you doing there, sweetie?
3;3;Pickle Rick;Beth;Well, I mean, you don't want to get pierced by a needle full of liquid unrelated to your situation. How's that gonna help?
3;3;Pickle Rick;Pickle Rick;Can't argue with that.
3;3;Pickle Rick;Beth;Great. We'll see you later.
3;3;Pickle Rick;Pickle Rick;Hey, hey, be careful with that. It's for something else. It's really important, so don't break it.
3;3;Pickle Rick;Pickle Rick;Okay, I may have fucked up here. Dup, ap, ap, pap, ut, dah, pap, pap, pap, pah. T-t-tah, tah. 
3;3;Pickle Rick;Pickle Rick;Oh, great. Stupid cat.
3;3;Pickle Rick;Pickle Rick;Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa! I know what it looks like to you, Izzy, but I'm not a snake! I've seen the YouTube videos, I know cats are scared of cucumbers and pickles because they think they're snakes. I'm not a snake! I'm a pickle, I'm a pickle!
3;3;Pickle Rick;Pickle Rick;Whoa! Oh! Whoa, whoa, whoa!
3;3;Pickle Rick;Pickle Rick;Oh, crap, that sun is bright.
3;3;Pickle Rick;Pickle Rick;Okay, come on. This can't really be the way I go out. This is the mega-genius equivalent of dying on the toilet.
3;3;Pickle Rick;Pickle Rick;So... hot. This is how I'm gonna die.
3;3;Pickle Rick;Pickle Rick;Oh, God, moisture.
3;3;Pickle Rick;Pickle Rick;Oh, God, the moisture! Dial it back, God! Dial it back a little bit here!
3;3;Pickle Rick;Pickle Rick;Oh! Oh!
3;3;Pickle Rick;Pickle Rick;Oh, God! Perpendicular, perpendicular!
3;3;Pickle Rick;Pickle Rick;Oh, SHIIIIIT!!! Oh! Oh! Oh!
3;3;Pickle Rick;Pickle Rick;Come on. That's it.
3;3;Pickle Rick;Pickle Rick;Come get this delicious brine.
3;3;Pickle Rick;Pickle Rick;Aah! Come on! Come on, motherfucker! Come on!
3;3;Pickle Rick;Pickle Rick;Yes!
3;3;Pickle Rick;Summer;How is this even family therapy if Dad's not invited and Grandpa won't come?
3;3;Pickle Rick;Morty;Yeah, and what's courageous about eating a hot dog?
3;3;Pickle Rick;Beth;It's nobody's choice to be here, you knobs. The family was told to get counseling by your principal, even though it's not the family that was huffing pottery glaze in the art room and desk wetting in history class.
3;3;Pickle Rick;Mr. Goldenfold;Oh, the Smith family, minus a dad. You're patients of Dr. Wong, too?
3;3;Pickle Rick;Beth;Temporarily. By order of the school.
3;3;Pickle Rick;Mr. Goldenfold;Me too. How long have you all been eating poop?
3;3;Pickle Rick;Summer;We... have never... eaten poop.
3;3;Pickle Rick;Mr. Goldenfold;Uh, me, neither. Say, where did my family get off to?
3;3;Pickle Rick;Dr. Wong;Smith family, I'm Dr. Wong. Come on in.
3;3;Pickle Rick;Dr. Wong;I was told there was a grandpa that might be joining us?
3;3;Pickle Rick;Beth;He got wrapped up in an experiment. He's a scientist. Like, legit, like on an inter-galactic, sci-fi level. His work is very --
3;3;Pickle Rick;Morty;He turned himself into a pickle.
3;3;Pickle Rick;Beth;Morty, Mom's talking. I'm sorry, I suppose that's a good segue into our little discipline cases here.
3;3;Pickle Rick;Dr. Wong;Does Grandpa turn himself into a pickle a lot?
3;3;Pickle Rick;Beth;What? No, what kind of question is that?
3;3;Pickle Rick;Dr. Wong;The kind that wasn't designed to attack or hurt you in any way.
3;3;Pickle Rick;Beth;Oh, Jesus Christ, one of these. No, my father has never turned himself into a pickle before. He's unpredictable and eccentric. The whole family is. Speaking of which...
3;3;Pickle Rick;Dr. Wong;Okay, let's open things up to the whole family, and let me ask this. Why do we think Grandpa turned himself into a pickle?
3;3;Pickle Rick;Pickle Rick;Wow. Ugh.
3;3;Pickle Rick;Pickle Rick;Hey, listen, I know this is your world not mine. The sooner I can get out, the sooner I can go back to taking big craps, and you can go back to subsisting on them.
3;3;Pickle Rick;Pickle Rick;You are one driven rat. Could you be a little more driven? To the right.
3;3;Pickle Rick;Pickle Rick;Yes, yes, yes! Come on, come on, come on! Fresh, fresh, fresh!
3;3;Pickle Rick;Pickle Rick;Whoa, whoa, whoa, was this your friend? Don't worry, he died doing what he loved, being a dumb fucking rat.
3;3;Pickle Rick;Pickle Rick;Oh, yeah! Aaaah!
3;3;Pickle Rick;Beth;I didn't say my father is perfect, I said his work is important.
3;3;Pickle Rick;Summer;And she's saying what's important is that Grandpa lied to you to get out of coming here.
3;3;Pickle Rick;Beth;Oh, he did not!
3;3;Pickle Rick;Dr. Wong;Let's do an experiment here. I get the impression this family values science. So raise your hand if you feel certain you know what was in the syringe. Raise your hand if you know for certain the syringe does not contain anti-pickle serum. Beth, your hand did a little thing there.
3;3;Pickle Rick;Beth;Do you really not see what's happening here?
3;3;Pickle Rick;Dr. Wong;Tell me.
3;3;Pickle Rick;Beth;Well, Dr. Wong -- by the way, racist name -- obviously, Morty and Summer are seizing on your arbitrary pickle obsession as an end run around what was supposed to be their therapy.
3;3;Pickle Rick;Dr. Wong;Oh, I think this pickle incident is a better path than any other to the heart of your family's dysfunction. I think it's possible that you and your father have a very specific dynamic. I don't think it's one that rewards emotion or vulnerability. I think it may punish them. I think it's possible that dynamic eroded your marriage, and is infecting your kids with a tendency to misdirect their feelings.
3;3;Pickle Rick;Beth;Fuck you.
3;3;Pickle Rick;Morty;Mom!
3;3;Pickle Rick;Summer;Mom!
3;3;Pickle Rick;Beth;Fuck both of you, too.
3;3;Pickle Rick;Pickle Rick;By the way, you might notice that in spite of your numerous distinctive features, I never gave you a name like Scar or Stripe or Goliath. That's because, to me, you aren't special. You were special to rats. Now they're dead. I guess it was me you should have impressed. God damn it, I love myself.
3;3;Pickle Rick;Pickle Rick;Pickle Riiick!
3;3;Pickle Rick;Pickle Rick;Get that parkour. Get that parkour! Hey, it's cool. Just need to find the nearest exit.
3;3;Pickle Rick;Pickle Rick;Whoa, whoa, whoa! No need to freak out.
3;3;Pickle Rick;Pickle Rick;Whoa! Who in the fuck's toilet is this?
3;3;Pickle Rick;Agency Director;What is it?
3;3;Pickle Rick;Agent #1;A pickle. A rat. Both.
3;3;Pickle Rick;Agent #2;It says it's a scientist.
3;3;Pickle Rick;Agency Director;Where is it?
3;3;Pickle Rick;Agent #1;It seems to be using the air ducts and the mail tubes to get around.
3;3;Pickle Rick;Agent #1;It's been gathering office supplies, we think, to build weaponry. But look what it did on the mezzanine. It transferred a bottle from the trash to the recycling bin. Whatever this thing is, it's shaming us.
3;3;Pickle Rick;Agency Director;We have 34 armed guards, and we can't kill a pickle?
3;3;Pickle Rick;Agent #1;32 armed guards. He killed two.
3;3;Pickle Rick;Agent #2;It's on the phone.
3;3;Pickle Rick;Agency Director;Put him on, and locate the phone he's using. Hello.
3;3;Pickle Rick;Pickle Rick;Hi, um, can you, uh  please let me out.
3;3;Pickle Rick;Agency Director;Your mere presence in this building violates international law. I couldn't let you out even if you hadn't killed two men.
3;3;Pickle Rick;Pickle Rick;You should know those men killed themselves.
3;3;Pickle Rick;Agency Director;And how is that?
3;3;Pickle Rick;Pickle Rick;They didn't  let me out.
3;3;Pickle Rick;Agent #2;Solen'ya.
3;3;Pickle Rick;Agency Director;Shut your mouth and do your jobs, you fucking children!
3;3;Pickle Rick;Pickle Rick;Uh, is this not a good time or...?

3;3;Pickle Rick;Pickle Rick;That'd be a lucky break for you.
3;3;Pickle Rick;Agent #1;Go, shoot to kill!
3;3;Pickle Rick;Agent #3;Aaah! We got him.
3;3;Pickle Rick;Agency Director;Ah.
3;3;Pickle Rick;Agent #1;Ah.
3;3;Pickle Rick;Pickle Rick;...because this pickle doesn't care about your children. And I'm not gonna take their dreams. I'm gonna take their parents.
3;3;Pickle Rick;Agent #2;Solen'ya! He's coming! It's because I threw half-way my sandwich!
3;3;Pickle Rick;Agency Director;He's just a pickle!
3;3;Pickle Rick;Agent #2;He's a monster!
3;3;Pickle Rick;Agency Director;He's not the only one. You can stay, dead to the world and die in this room. Or you can kill a pickle for me and earn your freedom.
3;3;Pickle Rick;Jaguar;There is no freedom while your leader breathes. Our country is a prison.
3;3;Pickle Rick;Agency Director;Then Katarina is a prisoner. Perhaps I could arrange her escape, as well. She lives, Jaguar.
3;3;Pickle Rick;Jaguar;Where is this pickle?
3;3;Pickle Rick;Dr. Wong;What do you think is in the syringe, Beth?
3;3;Pickle Rick;Beth;You're the one that costs $200 an hour. You tell me.
3;3;Pickle Rick;Morty;Anti-pickle serum.
3;3;Pickle Rick;Summer;Anti-pickle serum.
3;3;Pickle Rick;Dr. Wong;Your kids think it might be anti-pickle serum.
3;3;Pickle Rick;Beth;My kids pee their desks and suck on unbaked vases. They're just angry at me for divorcing their father.
3;3;Pickle Rick;Summer;I never said I was angry at you.
3;3;Pickle Rick;Beth;"That's the point of pottery-enamel huffing, Summer. You do it so you don't have to say I'm angry at mommy"" out loud."""
3;3;Pickle Rick;Morty;Oh, my God! Oh, there-there's pictures of people eating poop in there!
3;3;Pickle Rick;Dr. Wong;It's not my job to take sides or pass judgment. Do you think when your father asks for that syringe, you could ask him --
3;3;Pickle Rick;Beth;He won't have to ask for it, okay? He won't need it. He'll just make more. He doesn't need anything from anyone.
3;3;Pickle Rick;Dr. Wong;You admire him for that.
3;3;Pickle Rick;Beth;It's better than making your problems other people's problems.
3;3;Pickle Rick;Pickle Rick;Oh, come on!
3;3;Pickle Rick;Jaguar;Pickle Man, you should know this isn't personal!
3;3;Pickle Rick;Pickle Rick;You should know that isn't original.
3;3;Pickle Rick;Jaguar;They have my daughter. There's nothing I won't do to see her again.
3;3;Pickle Rick;Pickle Rick;Yeah, there's lots I wouldn't do to see my daughter, but killing you gets me to her quicker than your derivative bullshit.
3;3;Pickle Rick;Jaguar;I never bullshit, Pickle Man. This can only end with one of us dead, and I have never died.
3;3;Pickle Rick;Pickle Rick;That will be your downfall, Jaguar, not being open to new experiences.
3;3;Pickle Rick;Agency Director;Is it done? Jaguar?!
3;3;Pickle Rick;Pickle Rick;Jaguar couldn't make it.
3;3;Pickle Rick;Agency Director;Do it. Okay, you win, Pickle Man. I'm unsealing the building.
3;3;Pickle Rick;Pickle Rick;No, thanks. I'm coming for you now.
3;3;Pickle Rick;Agency Director;Pickle Man, there's $100 million worth of bonds in a safe on level two. I'll give you the combination.
3;3;Pickle Rick;Agent #2;That money belongs to the people.
3;3;Pickle Rick;Agency Director;Shut up and call me a helicopter, you prick! Do we have a deal?!
3;3;Pickle Rick;Pickle Rick;Take that money, give it to Jaguar's daughter when you set her free. Or I'll be visiting you.
3;3;Pickle Rick;Agency Director;Jaguar's daughter is dead.
3;3;Pickle Rick;Pickle Rick;Huh, so you're a liar.
3;3;Pickle Rick;Agency Director;Jaguar was an animal. You're an intelligent pickle. We can do business.
3;3;Pickle Rick;Pickle Rick;I don't think so. See you soon.
3;3;Pickle Rick;Agency Director;Is the helicopter here?
3;3;Pickle Rick;Agent #2;Yes. And the police are on the way. What do we tell them?
3;3;Pickle Rick;Agency Director;Tell them we were robbed.
3;3;Pickle Rick;Agency Director;Farewell, Solen'ya.
3;3;Pickle Rick;Jaguar;F-15s are scrambled. This helicopter will be shot down in seven minutes.
3;3;Pickle Rick;Pickle Rick;Well, my daughter is about five away, and I've got about eight to live.
3;3;Pickle Rick;Jaguar;Pickle Man, it's too late for me to tell my daughter I love her, but not for you.
3;3;Pickle Rick;Pickle Rick;Oh, well, uh, she knows. I mean, we don't really buy into that kind of crap, to the extent that love is an expression of familiarity over time, my access to infinite timelines precludes the necessity of attachment. In fact, I even abandoned one of my infinite daughters in an alternate version of earth that was taken over by mutants.
3;3;Pickle Rick;Jaguar;Okay. Good luck with that. Wait. Do I have infinite daughters?
3;3;Pickle Rick;Pickle Rick;Huh? Uh, no. No, nope, sorry about that. Nope, just me. Yeesh!
3;3;Pickle Rick;Beth;I am afraid that my kids will get expelled.
3;3;Pickle Rick;Dr. Wong;Good. Summer, you go.
3;3;Pickle Rick;Summer;I am mad that I can't huff enamel without people assuming it's because my family sucks. I hope to be seen one day as someone that just likes getting high.
3;3;Pickle Rick;Dr. Wong;"Good job. Morty, do you have an I"" statement?"""
3;3;Pickle Rick;Morty;I am sad that I peed. I'm sad that I peed in class instead of a toilet.
3;3;Pickle Rick;Dr. Wong;Look at this family go. You guys are pros. What do you guys think about doing this once a week?
3;3;Pickle Rick;Pickle Rick;Ugh.
3;3;Pickle Rick;Dr. Wong;You must be Rick.
3;3;Pickle Rick;Pickle Rick;Mm-hmm.
3;3;Pickle Rick;Dr. Wong;I've heard a lot about you today. Your family is crazy about you. Your daughter holds you in very high regard. You're a lucky fella.
3;3;Pickle Rick;Pickle Rick;Yeah, thank you. Uh, sweetie, you don't still happen to have that syringe in your purse?
3;3;Pickle Rick;Beth;Dad, I would like you to tell me what's in the syringe.
3;3;Pickle Rick;Pickle Rick;It's a serum that I need to, uh, to stay alive. I have had a rough day. And, uh, I've sustained a lot of damage. I'm pretty close to death, which the serum will prevent.
3;3;Pickle Rick;Dr. Wong;By changing you from a pickle to a human.
3;3;Pickle Rick;Pickle Rick;Yes.
3;3;Pickle Rick;Dr. Wong;Rick, why did you lie to your daughter?
3;3;Pickle Rick;Pickle Rick;So I wouldn't have to come here.
3;3;Pickle Rick;Dr. Wong;Why didn't you want to come here?
3;3;Pickle Rick;Pickle Rick;Because I don't respect therapy, because I'm a scientist. Because I invent, transform, create, and destroy for a living, and when I don't like something about the world, I change it. And I don't think going to a rented office in a strip mall to listen to some agent of averageness explain which words mean which feelings has ever helped anyone do anything. I think it's helped a lot of people get comfortable and stop panicking, which is a state of mind we value in the animals we eat, but not something I want for myself. I'm not a cow. I'm a pickle. When I feel like it. So...you asked.
3;3;Pickle Rick;Dr. Wong;Rick, the only connection between your unquestionable intelligence and the sickness destroying your family is that everyone in your family, you included, use intelligence to justify sickness. You seem to alternate between viewing your own mind as an unstoppable force and as an inescapable curse. And I think it's because the only truly unapproachable concept for you is that it's your mind within your control. You chose to come here, you chose to talk -to belittle my vocation- just as you chose to become a pickle. You are the master of your universe, and yet you are dripping with rat blood and feces. Your enormous mind literally vegetating by your own hand. I have no doubt that you would be bored senseless by therapy, the same way I'm bored when I brush my teeth and wipe my ass. Because the thing about repairing, maintaining, and cleaning is it's not an adventure. There's no way to do it so wrong you might die. It's just work. And the bottom line is, some people are okay going to work, and some people well, some people would rather die. Each of us gets to choose. That's our time. I'm going to give you guys my card and hope to hear from you again. And if you have any friends or family that eat poop and would like to stop, give them my number.
3;3;Pickle Rick;Pickle Rick;I, um I'm sorry I lied to get out of the thing. I, I shouldn't lie to you.
3;3;Pickle Rick;Beth;Oh, it's fine. I mean, thank you, and, yeah, you shouldn't. But I hope you know that's not what that session was supposed to be.
3;3;Pickle Rick;Pickle Rick;Oh, no, I mean, I know it was Morty peeing his pants and Summer snorting glue or whatever...
3;3;Pickle Rick;Beth;She huffed enamel, and we never even talked about it.
3;3;Pickle Rick;Pickle Rick;Well, there was so much more at stake. I mean, that shrink, what a monologuist.
3;3;Pickle Rick;Summer;Are we gonna go back?
3;3;Pickle Rick;Pickle Rick;Sweetie, could I ge-get that syringe now?
3;3;Pickle Rick;Beth;Oh, my God, yes! Dad, it's in my purse. Oh, I'm sorry. You must be in agony.
3;3;Pickle Rick;Pickle Rick;Eh.
3;3;Pickle Rick;Rick;Jesus. Jesus Christ. Therapists, man.
3;3;Pickle Rick;Beth;Weird breed.
3;3;Pickle Rick;Rick;Man, I missed having hands and blood and a stomach. We should get a drink.
3;3;Pickle Rick;Beth;Really? Like, go somewhere?
3;3;Pickle Rick;Rick;Yeah, let's drop the kids off and go tie one on.
3;3;Pickle Rick;Beth;Absolutely!
3;3;Pickle Rick;Morty;I, I liked her.
3;3;Pickle Rick;Beth;So what are you thinking, like, Smokey's Tavern? Maybe Shoney's?
3;3;Pickle Rick;Rick;Yeah, either one. Either one.
3;3;Pickle Rick;Rick;You'll never get away with this, Concerto.
3;3;Pickle Rick;Concerto;That is where you're mistaken, Mr. Sanchez. This shall be my greatest performance of all time!
3;3;Pickle Rick;Rick;This is it, Morty. We're goners. We're not getting out of this one. After everything we've been through, this is how we're gonna die. Make peace with your god.
3;3;Pickle Rick;Morty;Oh, geez, Rick, I-I-I don't want to die!
3;3;Pickle Rick;Concerto;And now for the E-splat!
3;3;Pickle Rick;Rick;Jaguar!
3;3;Pickle Rick;Morty;Who? Who was that, Rick?
3;3;Pickle Rick;Rick;That, Morty, is why you don't go to therapy.
3;4;Vindicators 3: The Return Of Worldender;Rick;Don't let any of those things get away, Morty. If their DNA gets into Earth's food chain, our entire species could be sterilized.
3;4;Vindicators 3: The Return Of Worldender;Morty;Then why aren't we killing them?!
3;4;Vindicators 3: The Return Of Worldender;Rick;Great. Next time I need a species sterilized, who's gonna do it for me? You?
3;4;Vindicators 3: The Return Of Worldender;Morty;Oh, Rick! I-Is that the Vindibeacon? We're being called to assemble by the Vindicators!
3;4;Vindicators 3: The Return Of Worldender;Rick;I refuse to answer a literal call to adventure, Morty. Let it go to voicemail!
3;4;Vindicators 3: The Return Of Worldender;Morty;Rick, the Vindicators only call when the universe itself is at stake! They're first line of defense against evil! They're the guardians of the unguarded!
3;4;Vindicators 3: The Return Of Worldender;Rick;They're the writers of their own press releases, Morty! They're a bunch of drama queens that spend an hour talking and twenty minutes jumping around while shit blows up. They're a phase. We did one, it was the big event of that summer. Let it die.
3;4;Vindicators 3: The Return Of Worldender;Morty;I, Morty Smith, invoke my right to choose one in every ten Rick and Morty adventures.  Read 'em and weep.
3;4;Vindicators 3: The Return Of Worldender;Rick;God... fuckin' dammit!  Fine! But don't say I didn't warn you. 
3;4;Vindicators 3: The Return Of Worldender;Morty; Yes!  Vindicator command ship, beacon received! We're doing Vindicators Twoooooooooo!
3;4;Vindicators 3: The Return Of Worldender;Rick;Whoops! Uh, Morty, you might want to freeze some sperm.
3;4;Vindicators 3: The Return Of Worldender;Supernova; Vindicators, Worldender is back...
3;4;Vindicators 3: The Return Of Worldender;Supernova;..and this time, he's out to end more than worlds. We have reason to believe his stronghold is located on...
3;4;Vindicators 3: The Return Of Worldender;Rick; My balls.
3;4;Vindicators 3: The Return Of Worldender;Morty;Rick!
3;4;Vindicators 3: The Return Of Worldender;Supernova;...the Terraneus system. Once in range, Million Ants will scan for pheromone activity, which should lead us to the location of the base.
3;4;Vindicators 3: The Return Of Worldender;Rick;Oh, that's Million Ants. I can't see the ants over here. It just assumed that was, uh, Turd Man. Wiggly Turd Man.
3;4;Vindicators 3: The Return Of Worldender;Morty;Rick, stop!
3;4;Vindicators 3: The Return Of Worldender;Supernova;Rick, you have something to add to the briefing?
3;4;Vindicators 3: The Return Of Worldender;Rick;Uh, yeah, just a few more design notes.  Um, this guy. The, uh... The, uh...
3;4;Vindicators 3: The Return Of Worldender;Crocubot;I am Crocubot.
3;4;Vindicators 3: The Return Of Worldender;Rick;Right, Crocubot. So, you're half-cold, unfeeling reptile, half-also cold, equally-unfeeling machine.
3;4;Vindicators 3: The Return Of Worldender;Crocubot;Yes.
3;4;Vindicators 3: The Return Of Worldender;Rick;So, you're origin is what? Y-You fell into a vat of redundancy?
3;4;Vindicators 3: The Return Of Worldender;Noob-Noob; Got damn!
3;4;Vindicators 3: The Return Of Worldender;Supernova;Noob-Noob, we're having a briefing!  If I can continue, Rick. I anticipate sophisticated security measures. I trust you can be of service there.
3;4;Vindicators 3: The Return Of Worldender;Rick;Well, let me check my list of powers and weaknesses. Ability to do anything... But only whenever I want... Yeah, that sounds like a job for me.
3;4;Vindicators 3: The Return Of Worldender;Alan;I wish he had the ability to check is attitude.
3;4;Vindicators 3: The Return Of Worldender;Rick;Alan Rails, ladies and gentleman. After his parents' tragic death in a railroad accident, he gained the power to summon ghost trains. It's not all bad, though. They were spared having to see their grown son wear a whistle!
3;4;Vindicators 3: The Return Of Worldender;Noob-Noob;Got damn!
3;4;Vindicators 3: The Return Of Worldender;Rick;Thanks, Noob-Noob! This guy gets it.
3;4;Vindicators 3: The Return Of Worldender;Morty;Vance Maximus, Renegade Star Soldier!
3;4;Vindicators 3: The Return Of Worldender;Vance;Sorry I'm late. It was happy hour.
3;4;Vindicators 3: The Return Of Worldender;Morty; Happy hour.
3;4;Vindicators 3: The Return Of Worldender;Rick;Uh, I was also late because of my drinking and mentioned it to zero applause.
3;4;Vindicators 3: The Return Of Worldender;Vance;Rick Sanchez, Tinkerer of Terror. Man, that's hard to say. And... Morty, right?
3;4;Vindicators 3: The Return Of Worldender;Morty;Whoa, yeah!
3;4;Vindicators 3: The Return Of Worldender;Vance;I never forget a kid.  What do you say, Vindicators? Let's make this three for three?
3;4;Vindicators 3: The Return Of Worldender;Morty;"Did he say three for three""?"""
3;4;Vindicators 3: The Return Of Worldender;Rick;Did he say he never forgets a kid?
3;4;Vindicators 3: The Return Of Worldender;Morty;"You mean two for two"", right, Vance?"""
3;4;Vindicators 3: The Return Of Worldender;Supernova;Actually, we assembled a second time last summer to fight Doomnomitron.
3;4;Vindicators 3: The Return Of Worldender;Morty;So, this is... Vindicators 3? And you guys did Vindicators 2... w-without us?
3;4;Vindicators 3: The Return Of Worldender;Million Ants; I sense... insecurity.
3;4;Vindicators 3: The Return Of Worldender;Vance;Are you sure there's not just a picnic nearby.
3;4;Vindicators 3: The Return Of Worldender;Rick;I guess he found his crowd. Pretty toothless stuff, guys.
3;4;Vindicators 3: The Return Of Worldender;Rick; I hope you're happy with the adventure so far, Morty. These guys are even lamer than last time.

3;4;Vindicators 3: The Return Of Worldender;Rick;Yikes. Yeah, things did feel less diverse in there.

3;4;Vindicators 3: The Return Of Worldender;Rick;Don't worry, Morty, they love you. Superheroes need a wide-eyed unremarkable to tag along and react to everything like it's mind-blowing.
3;4;Vindicators 3: The Return Of Worldender;Morty;I... think the personality conflict might have been... you.
3;4;Vindicators 3: The Return Of Worldender;Rick; Jesus... How awesome is that? I mean, they wanted to not need me so bad, they murdered three innocent heroes of color, and they still had to bring me back?
3;4;Vindicators 3: The Return Of Worldender;Morty;Rick, since it's my adventure and all, could you do me a favor?
3;4;Vindicators 3: The Return Of Worldender;Rick;Uh, the adventure is the favor, Morty. Me sleeping on these linens is the favor. I mean, w-w-w-what--what are we vindicating? Comfort?
3;4;Vindicators 3: The Return Of Worldender;Morty;Rick, this really bums me out. It-It's embarrassing to find out these guys don't like us.
3;4;Vindicators 3: The Return Of Worldender;Rick;Why? Morty,  I defeat gagoos more powerful than these guys every week.
3;4;Vindicators 3: The Return Of Worldender;Morty;Yeah, but not heroes.
3;4;Vindicators 3: The Return Of Worldender;Rick;Oh, please. They just call themselves heroes so they can...
3;4;Vindicators 3: The Return Of Worldender;Morty;I'm calling them that, Rick! They're my heroes! Mine! 
3;4;Vindicators 3: The Return Of Worldender;Rick;Huh... no accounting for taste. I'm gonna go get a drink.
3;4;Vindicators 3: The Return Of Worldender;PA System;Good morning, Vindicators. Ship has arrived at Terraneus system. All Vindicators report to the... briefing room. The--The room from the, uh... the... Uh, it's the d--It's a different room than--than... conference room. I'm sorry, it's my first day as a PA system. First day jitters. 
3;4;Vindicators 3: The Return Of Worldender;Morty; Oh, God.
3;4;Vindicators 3: The Return Of Worldender;Supernova;Good morning. Looks like your grandpa had a long night. Crocubot, why don't you escort Mr. Sanchez to a more comfortable spot so that someone can...  clean up his diarrhea.
3;4;Vindicators 3: The Return Of Worldender;Noob-Noob;Whoa, I'm nervous about my first mission.
3;4;Vindicators 3: The Return Of Worldender;Supernova;Actually, Noob-Noob, you have a new mission. 
3;4;Vindicators 3: The Return Of Worldender;Noob-Noob; Got... damn.
3;4;Vindicators 3: The Return Of Worldender;Supernova;Vindicators, prepare for arrival.
3;4;Vindicators 3: The Return Of Worldender;Vance;Morty, the Vindicators and I had a chat this morning and I'm afraid we need to make a little change.
3;4;Vindicators 3: The Return Of Worldender;Morty; I-I totally get it. I-I'm so sorry.
3;4;Vindicators 3: The Return Of Worldender;Vance;You should be.  Running around in a yellow t-shirt like you're not one of us? Disgraceful.
3;4;Vindicators 3: The Return Of Worldender;Morty; I-I-I... I'm not a superhero.
3;4;Vindicators 3: The Return Of Worldender;Vance;Cop a squat, chief.  Everyone in the universe is a hero. All you have to do is know the difference between good and bad, and root for good.

3;4;Vindicators 3: The Return Of Worldender;Vance;Yeah, well, I get the feeling... he kind of needs that to be the case.  Not coming, Noob-Noob?

3;4;Vindicators 3: The Return Of Worldender;Vance;Security drones, inbound.

3;4;Vindicators 3: The Return Of Worldender;Million Ants;Aah!  Gun turret.
3;4;Vindicators 3: The Return Of Worldender;Supernova;Are you all right?
3;4;Vindicators 3: The Return Of Worldender;Million Ants;Yes. I only lost 400 ants. My queen is laying more.  I am back to one million ants.
3;4;Vindicators 3: The Return Of Worldender;Supernova;Someone wake up Sanchez.
3;4;Vindicators 3: The Return Of Worldender;Rick;Ugh! Oh, Christ...
3;4;Vindicators 3: The Return Of Worldender;Supernova;Rick, you're up.
3;4;Vindicators 3: The Return Of Worldender;Rick;Barely.
3;4;Vindicators 3: The Return Of Worldender;Supernova;Rick, we're taking fire from an automated turret. Can you bring it offline?
3;4;Vindicators 3: The Return Of Worldender;Rick;Uh-huh.
3;4;Vindicators 3: The Return Of Worldender;Rick;Uh, my God, that's better.
3;4;Vindicators 3: The Return Of Worldender;Supernova;RICK!
3;4;Vindicators 3: The Return Of Worldender;Rick;Hey, I can't help if I can't see.
3;4;Vindicators 3: The Return Of Worldender;Alan;I could've just used a ghost train.
3;4;Vindicators 3: The Return Of Worldender;Rick;Really? You don't say. You would have used a ghost train?  Hey, everybody, the ghost train guy would have used a ghost train!
3;4;Vindicators 3: The Return Of Worldender;Alan;Man, fuck you.
3;4;Vindicators 3: The Return Of Worldender;Rick;Is there coffee? Hey, Morty, can you be a pal? Grandpa left his coffee maker on the ship. Y-You know, the French press thing?
3;4;Vindicators 3: The Return Of Worldender;Morty; Get it yourself.
3;4;Vindicators 3: The Return Of Worldender;Rick;Little extra  snippy this morning, aren't you?
3;4;Vindicators 3: The Return Of Worldender;Morty;Just focus on the mission, all right?
3;4;Vindicators 3: The Return Of Worldender;Rick; Oh, oh, oh, I'm sorry. Oh, you're right. Ooh, real serious. Gotta take it real serious, huh? 
3;4;Vindicators 3: The Return Of Worldender;Alan; Son of a steam engine! They're all dead!
3;4;Vindicators 3: The Return Of Worldender;Crocubot;Why would Worldender do this to his own men... and several women?
3;4;Vindicators 3: The Return Of Worldender;Vance;Well, he is the Worldender. The guy ends worlds. Kind of his thing.
3;4;Vindicators 3: The Return Of Worldender;Rick; Ooh, real scared. Real fucking on alert, high alert over here.
3;4;Vindicators 3: The Return Of Worldender;Vance;What the FUCK?!
3;4;Vindicators 3: The Return Of Worldender;Supernova;It's Worldender! What happened to him?
3;4;Vindicators 3: The Return Of Worldender;Million Ants;I sense his life force is fading.
3;4;Vindicators 3: The Return Of Worldender;Rick;Million Ants, ladies and gentleman! The ant colony with the power of two human eyes!
3;4;Vindicators 3: The Return Of Worldender;Rick;All right. Short mission, good mission. Remember when Alan wanted to use a ghost train? See you guys in Vindicators 4. Morty?
3;4;Vindicators 3: The Return Of Worldender;Morty;Rick, whoever did this is an even bigger threat than Worldender! We can't leave now!
3;4;Vindicators 3: The Return Of Worldender;Supernova;He's right. This is far from over.
3;4;Vindicators 3: The Return Of Worldender;Rick;Well, have fun with that. But Morty and I have to meet a comet girl, a monorail man, two assholes and a full alligator in, like, an hour.
3;4;Vindicators 3: The Return Of Worldender;Rick;Shit.
3;4;Vindicators 3: The Return Of Worldender;Million Ants;I sense the presence of a greater evil.
3;4;Vindicators 3: The Return Of Worldender;Drunk Rick;Check, check, One, two. Okay, is it recording? Good. Hello, Vindicators. Welcome to your reckoning, babyyyyyyyy!!
3;4;Vindicators 3: The Return Of Worldender;Rick;Welp, it's official. I had too much to drink last night.
3;4;Vindicators 3: The Return Of Worldender;Drunk Rick; If you guys are watching this, you're, you know, the Vindicators. So now that we know...
3;4;Vindicators 3: The Return Of Worldender;Vance; Rick? What's going on, buddy?
3;4;Vindicators 3: The Return Of Worldender;Rick;Obviously, I came here last night during a blackout.
3;4;Vindicators 3: The Return Of Worldender;Supernova;Obviously? You came here and defeated our arch-nemesis while so drunk, you don't remember doing it? That's something obvious to you?
3;4;Vindicators 3: The Return Of Worldender;Rick;Look, I'm a lit-- little more complex than you guys and, no offense, but I've always suspected that a lot of what you do in a year could be knocked out in a couple of hours.

3;4;Vindicators 3: The Return Of Worldender;Rick; Well, I-I-I think we've seen enough. I'll just figure out how to unplug this. 
3;4;Vindicators 3: The Return Of Worldender;Drunk Rick;Okay, here we go, room number one. The Vindicators are known throughout the galaxy, but do they know yourselves? Do you know yourselves? Match your... your shit, your... your gimmicks with your faces and y-you get it, it's a matching thing. And do it in three minutes, or you'll  all die.
3;4;Vindicators 3: The Return Of Worldender;Vance;Screw this. I'm not playing his game. I'm gonna find us a way out of here.
3;4;Vindicators 3: The Return Of Worldender;Rick;Whoa, whoa, whoa. Hold on, Vance. He said you'd die if you tried to leave. That means there's booby traps.
3;4;Vindicators 3: The Return Of Worldender;Vance;Why are you acting like that's not you?!
3;4;Vindicators 3: The Return Of Worldender;Rick;"What part of blackout"" don't you understand? I thought you drank?"""
3;4;Vindicators 3: The Return Of Worldender;Vance;Like cool drinking! Like sexy drinking, not this psycho trailer-park shit!
3;4;Vindicators 3: The Return Of Worldender;Morty;Vance, stay calm...
3;4;Vindicators 3: The Return Of Worldender;Vance;Oh, so you're the leader now because we gave you a jacket?! You're the learning-disabled kid we do photo-ops with!
3;4;Vindicators 3: The Return Of Worldender;Morty;Okay, ouch, but...
3;4;Vindicators 3: The Return Of Worldender;Vance; Okay, this... this is triggering me. I need space. I-I need SPACE! FROM THIS!
3;4;Vindicators 3: The Return Of Worldender;Alan;Give me one good reason why I shouldn't crush your windpipe!
3;4;Vindicators 3: The Return Of Worldender;Rick;Because my epidermis is laced with a nanofiber defense mesh.
3;4;Vindicators 3: The Return Of Worldender;Rick;And because, like I said, I don't remember last night.
3;4;Vindicators 3: The Return Of Worldender;Alan;I told you not to invite this mummified motherfucker back!
3;4;Vindicators 3: The Return Of Worldender;Rick;Alan, I'm not proud of what's happening here, but if you keep coming at me, there's gonna be another passenger on that ghost train.
3;4;Vindicators 3: The Return Of Worldender;Morty;Guys!  I've figured it out.
3;4;Vindicators 3: The Return Of Worldender;Drunk Rick;Congrats! You did it-- it!
3;4;Vindicators 3: The Return Of Worldender;Morty;It was a bit. All of the descriptors apply to all of you. Drunk Rick's point is that none of you are very special or different.  That's always his point.
3;4;Vindicators 3: The Return Of Worldender;Supernova;Let's just get through this as quickly as possible. Then, we'll deal with the two of you.
3;4;Vindicators 3: The Return Of Worldender;Morty;The two of us?!  I hope you're proud of yourself!
3;4;Vindicators 3: The Return Of Worldender;Rick;Uh, I kind of am. I saved the goddamn universe.
3;4;Vindicators 3: The Return Of Worldender;Morty;That's not the issue, Rick!
3;4;Vindicators 3: The Return Of Worldender;Rick;Ahh, it would've been if I hadn't.
3;4;Vindicators 3: The Return Of Worldender;Drunk Rick;The Vindicators say their job is... is to fight evil wherever it hides, but they don't... pick the location you'll... you'll never even hear them mention, because to fight darkness is to fight yourself.
3;4;Vindicators 3: The Return Of Worldender;Crocubot;Oh, I know this! Dorian 5! 
3;4;Vindicators 3: The Return Of Worldender;Supernova;Crocubot, don't!
3;4;Vindicators 3: The Return Of Worldender;Crocubot; There's no other possible answer. My mechanical and reptilian logic are certain of it.
3;4;Vindicators 3: The Return Of Worldender;Rick;Huh, I'm seeing more croc than bot here.
3;4;Vindicators 3: The Return Of Worldender;Supernova;Goddammit!
3;4;Vindicators 3: The Return Of Worldender;Morty;Uh, what happened on Dorian 5?
3;4;Vindicators 3: The Return Of Worldender;Supernova;Nothing!
3;4;Vindicators 3: The Return Of Worldender;Alan;Nothing?! We exterminated a planet!
3;4;Vindicators 3: The Return Of Worldender;Morty;W-Wait, huh?
3;4;Vindicators 3: The Return Of Worldender;Supernova;Doomnomitron was hiding there! He's a shapeshifter! Destroying Dorian 5 was the only way to kill him!
3;4;Vindicators 3: The Return Of Worldender;Drunk Rick;Come on, guys, we're all thinking it. Don't...  Don't make me say it.
3;4;Vindicators 3: The Return Of Worldender;Morty; Oh, o-okay. This again? 
3;4;Vindicators 3: The Return Of Worldender;Rick;You know,  I could have made a device to detect Doomnomitron from orbit like  that.
3;4;Vindicators 3: The Return Of Worldender;Supernova;I'm not the one that didn't want you back. Alan was!
3;4;Vindicators 3: The Return Of Worldender;Alan; If you lay those deaths at my doorstep one more time...
3;4;Vindicators 3: The Return Of Worldender;Million Ants; Do not threaten her!
3;4;Vindicators 3: The Return Of Worldender;Drunk Rick;Congrats, you did it!
3;4;Vindicators 3: The Return Of Worldender;Supernova;What the hell is Is-ra-el?
3;4;Vindicators 3: The Return Of Worldender;Morty;I-It's just something Rick starts talking about whenever he's blackout drunk.
3;4;Vindicators 3: The Return Of Worldender;Rick;W-What? In w--In w-w-what--In what way? Like, w-w-what's my point?
3;4;Vindicators 3: The Return Of Worldender;Morty;In a way that has no point! You just babble about defense budgets and the United Nations, and then you pass out!
3;4;Vindicators 3: The Return Of Worldender;Rick;So, to be clear, I sometimes reference the geopolitical complexities of the topic, which is not the same as going to an anti-Semitic place.
3;4;Vindicators 3: The Return Of Worldender;Million Ants;I have no stake in this.
3;4;Vindicators 3: The Return Of Worldender;Rick;I don't either. I-I'm just saying, if anything, the drunk version of me is probably so supportive of Israel, he wants what's best for it and...
3;4;Vindicators 3: The Return Of Worldender;Million Ants;Hey, man, I'm not touching this. You do you.
3;4;Vindicators 3: The Return Of Worldender;Drunk Rick;Aloha... means hello and goodbye in Hawaii. But, uh, aloha means... has nothing to do with this room.  I'm so fucking drunk. Ugh, okay, here's the deal. I-I want to rest my eyes for a little bit. I'm--I'm not going to sleep. I just... just need to rest my eye, so let's make this one simple. Just try to hit some three-pointers.
3;4;Vindicators 3: The Return Of Worldender;Drunk Rick;let's say... you have to hit... five three-pointers in... five minutes or, I don't know, the whole place--the whole planet will get blown up with a n-neutrino bomb. And try to make it a-a lesson about yourselves like, like how... selfish you a-are, or something. Also, Hawaii.
3;4;Vindicators 3: The Return Of Worldender;Morty; You guys hit the baskets. I'll disarm the drunkenly-improvised neutrino bomb. There's a 40% chance it's a dud, but y-you should still stay back. 
3;4;Vindicators 3: The Return Of Worldender;Rick;Morty, how many of these...?
3;4;Vindicators 3: The Return Of Worldender;Morty; Too many, Rick! Too many!
3;4;Vindicators 3: The Return Of Worldender;Rick;Man, I am really getting high-roaded today. 
3;4;Vindicators 3: The Return Of Worldender;Drunk Rick;That's a three-pointer!
3;4;Vindicators 3: The Return Of Worldender;Alan;Nice shot.
3;4;Vindicators 3: The Return Of Worldender;Million Ants;Thank you.
3;4;Vindicators 3: The Return Of Worldender;Alan;You two make quite a team. 
3;4;Vindicators 3: The Return Of Worldender;Supernova;We all do.
3;4;Vindicators 3: The Return Of Worldender;Alan;Yeah, I guess.
3;4;Vindicators 3: The Return Of Worldender;Drunk Rick;That's a three-pointer!
3;4;Vindicators 3: The Return Of Worldender;Alan; But you guys have always had a... an unspoken bond.
3;4;Vindicators 3: The Return Of Worldender;Alan;"I mean, really unspoken. Like, let's-not-tell-my-husband"" unspoken."""
3;4;Vindicators 3: The Return Of Worldender;Supernova; We aren't married anymore, Alan.
3;4;Vindicators 3: The Return Of Worldender;Alan;" Sure, but were we married when you two were stranded"" on Delphi 6 for three days? Because I sensed something was weird when you can back. But what do I know about sensitivity? I'm just a phantom train conductor. You're the pile of ordinary bugs that fucked my wife!"""
3;4;Vindicators 3: The Return Of Worldender;Drunk Rick;That's a three-pointer!
3;4;Vindicators 3: The Return Of Worldender;Rick;Where the fuck is the lead wire?!
3;4;Vindicators 3: The Return Of Worldender;Morty;You always put it in the weirdest place! Um, uh, over here, maybe?
3;4;Vindicators 3: The Return Of Worldender;Rick;Jesus Christ, what a shitty neutrino bomb. It's a miracle I actually every destroy anything.
3;4;Vindicators 3: The Return Of Worldender;Morty;"Oh, I don't know. You managed to destroy just about everything today; the villains, the heroes, the lines between them, my childhood..."
3;4;Vindicators 3: The Return Of Worldender;Rick;Thank you. I appreciate it, Morty. I know you were sucking the Kool-Aid out of the Vindicators' dicks, so the fact that I was right about them must be pretty hard to admit.
3;4;Vindicators 3: The Return Of Worldender;Morty;Yeah, it is. You know why, Rick? Because when you're an asshole, it doesn't matter how right you are, nobody wants to give you the satisfaction.
3;4;Vindicators 3: The Return Of Worldender;Rick;I know. Everyone wants people they like to be right. That's why popular people are fucking dumb. And why your pretentious, poorly-written, high-budget friends back there can eat a double-decker shit sandwich.  Disarmed.
3;4;Vindicators 3: The Return Of Worldender;Morty; Holy shit. You're jealous.
3;4;Vindicators 3: The Return Of Worldender;Supernova;YES! Is that what you want to hear?!
3;4;Vindicators 3: The Return Of Worldender;Alan;Did it feel good?! Did you like his six million wriggling legs more than my tragedy-stricken, half-ghost, half-tumescent penis?!
3;4;Vindicators 3: The Return Of Worldender;Drunk Rick;That's a three-pointer!
3;4;Vindicators 3: The Return Of Worldender;Morty;Guys, stop! You're just proving my asshole grandpa right!
3;4;Vindicators 3: The Return Of Worldender;Supernova; You wish this was about sex! We loved each other! We had a child together.
3;4;Vindicators 3: The Return Of Worldender;Alan;WHAT?!
3;4;Vindicators 3: The Return Of Worldender;Supernova; I conceived a child with Million Ants and it died inside me because it as HALF A MILLION ANTS AND HALF COLLAPSING STAR! And yes, he was better than you!
3;4;Vindicators 3: The Return Of Worldender;Alan;Yeah?
3;4;Vindicators 3: The Return Of Worldender;Million Ants; One million times better!
3;4;Vindicators 3: The Return Of Worldender;Alan;ALL ABOOOOOOARD, MOTHERFUCKER!!!
3;4;Vindicators 3: The Return Of Worldender;Supernova;STOP! 
3;4;Vindicators 3: The Return Of Worldender;Rick;Oof! Didn't see that comin'.
3;4;Vindicators 3: The Return Of Worldender;Supernova;Is that sarcasm?!  I don't want you slipping away then this is over! All of these deaths are on your hands!
3;4;Vindicators 3: The Return Of Worldender;Rick;Oh, come on, maybe a couple of them, but definitely not the train guy.
3;4;Vindicators 3: The Return Of Worldender;Supernova;All of them.
3;4;Vindicators 3: The Return Of Worldender;Rick;O-kayyy...
3;4;Vindicators 3: The Return Of Worldender;Drunk Rick;Congrats, you did it!
3;4;Vindicators 3: The Return Of Worldender;Drunk Rick;All right, by now, I've been pretty clear that I think the Vindicators are  full of shit. But... you do have one thing I'll never have. And that thing is the only part of the Vindicators with any value to me. If you know what it is, place it on the platform. Guess wrong and the pla... planet will explode. And probably the solar system, 'cause I kind of fucking eyeballed the neutrino bombs on this one.
3;4;Vindicators 3: The Return Of Worldender;Supernova;So what's the trick? Morty, you're the Drunk Rick expert.
3;4;Vindicators 3: The Return Of Worldender;Morty;I think... no matter what we put on there, we die. He said it's the part of the Vindicators he values. That means nothing. He wants our last moment alive to be spent knowing how few fucks he gave.
3;4;Vindicators 3: The Return Of Worldender;Supernova;Jesus! Okay, open to second opinions!
3;4;Vindicators 3: The Return Of Worldender;Rick;I could--It could be Morty.
3;4;Vindicators 3: The Return Of Worldender;Morty;What?
3;4;Vindicators 3: The Return Of Worldender;Rick;"Hey, I don't know. I mean, look, when I get drunk, I get stupid and emotional and there's no logic to it. It's, like, possible I got so drunk, I felt like I was losing Morty to the Vindicators, and maybe this is my way of saying Okay, you can have him, but only if you know how important he is, otherwise I'll kill you."""""
3;4;Vindicators 3: The Return Of Worldender;Million Ants;That is a... really specific guess.
3;4;Vindicators 3: The Return Of Worldender;Rick;Look, I... there's nothing in the room but us. I'm just using logic to connect some dots. It's the best guess I've got.
3;4;Vindicators 3: The Return Of Worldender;Supernova;But you're betting our lives on it.
3;4;Vindicators 3: The Return Of Worldender;Morty; I'll cover that bet. I get it.
3;4;Vindicators 3: The Return Of Worldender;Rick;Well, Morty, I think you're making that smirky face because you're misinterpreting the moment. I am not being coy about some hidden love for you. I want to be really clear that, if anyone has a better guess, like, if I gave you an amulet last night, or...
3;4;Vindicators 3: The Return Of Worldender;Rick;Oh, shit.
3;4;Vindicators 3: The Return Of Worldender;Drunk Rick;Sorry, I'm... not good at goodbyes. It looks like I'm never gonna see you again. I can't really roll with the hero types, and I don't... th-they don't want me around. But I want... you to know, even if I didn't show it at the time, II really appreciated you sticking by me.
3;4;Vindicators 3: The Return Of Worldender;Drunk Rick; Goddammit, why am I crying? It makes no sense.
3;4;Vindicators 3: The Return Of Worldender;Drunk Rick;Ugh, y-you're probably confused because we barely know each other...
3;4;Vindicators 3: The Return Of Worldender;Drunk Rick;"...but you really stuck your neck out  when you gave me props for my awesome jokes in the briefing room. Everybody else had their heads so far up their ass. Even my own grandson is like, Oh, the Vindicators are so cool."" I mean, he's a moron, it's their... demographic. But you're different, Noob-Noob."""
3;4;Vindicators 3: The Return Of Worldender;Morty; ...Motherfucker!
3;4;Vindicators 3: The Return Of Worldender;Drunk Rick; You're fucking cool! And you're smart! And I bet we coulda hung out and shit! And I hope you get to be a full-fledged Vindicator! A-And d-do me a favor. Do-Don't let him know I... I got emotional. But you can tell him one thing. Tell him I said... Oh, fuck. Okay, I just shit myself. Okay, later.
3;4;Vindicators 3: The Return Of Worldender;Rick;W--Dude, Morty, what happened i...?
3;4;Vindicators 3: The Return Of Worldender;Morty;Shut up.
3;4;Vindicators 3: The Return Of Worldender;Million Ants;I sense this means we are not dying.
3;4;Vindicators 3: The Return Of Worldender;Supernova;Not all of us.
3;4;Vindicators 3: The Return Of Worldender;Million Ants;Sweetheart?
3;4;Vindicators 3: The Return Of Worldender;Supernova;Just let Titty-Bean do this, Snuzzles. It's for the greater good.
3;4;Vindicators 3: The Return Of Worldender;Morty;Greater good?!
3;4;Vindicators 3: The Return Of Worldender;Rick;Titty-Bean?
3;4;Vindicators 3: The Return Of Worldender;Supernova;"It's like you said, Morty,""there's no right or wrong."""
3;4;Vindicators 3: The Return Of Worldender;Morty;Never said that!
3;4;Vindicators 3: The Return Of Worldender;Supernova;It's the galaxy's faith in the Vindicators that keeps the galaxy secure!
3;4;Vindicators 3: The Return Of Worldender;Rick; Yeah, I feel safer already.
3;4;Vindicators 3: The Return Of Worldender;Morty;No doubt. Who do we make the check out to?
3;4;Vindicators 3: The Return Of Worldender;Rick;I'll say, we are gettin' some good licks in while choking to death.
3;4;Vindicators 3: The Return Of Worldender;Morty;Right?
3;4;Vindicators 3: The Return Of Worldender;Million Ants;Titty-Bean, listen to me. When you came to me, I was merely a sentient colony of ants. It was your beliefs, your pursuit of justice, that taught me to be a man.
3;4;Vindicators 3: The Return Of Worldender;Supernova;When did it get so complicated?
3;4;Vindicators 3: The Return Of Worldender;Million Ants;Who knows? But we can make it simple again.
3;4;Vindicators 3: The Return Of Worldender;Supernova;You were always the romantic.  Which is why you can't leave either.
3;4;Vindicators 3: The Return Of Worldender;Supernova;Goodbye, my love.
3;4;Vindicators 3: The Return Of Worldender;Rick;Damn! She double-crossed Snuzzles!
3;4;Vindicators 3: The Return Of Worldender;Supernova;Silence! I'm going to enjoy this...
3;4;Vindicators 3: The Return Of Worldender;Announcer;"Let's give a huge thanks to Rick Sanchez for killing Worldender, putting this awesome party together, and for booking one of the hottest talents out there,Logic!"""
3;4;Vindicators 3: The Return Of Worldender;Logic; Aww, yeah! 
3;4;Vindicators 3: The Return Of Worldender;Rick;Look at that. Geez, I must've planned a whole party. Invited a bunch of people. Not bad, Drunk Rick, not bad.
3;4;Vindicators 3: The Return Of Worldender;Logic;Are you ready? There's a choo-choo train man, he's rolling down tragedy. Everybody knowing Supernova fights gravity.
3;4;Vindicators 3: The Return Of Worldender;Morty;Rick, Supernova's getting away!
3;4;Vindicators 3: The Return Of Worldender;Rick;Ah, who cares?
3;4;Vindicators 3: The Return Of Worldender;Morty;But.. she was trying to kill us!
3;4;Vindicators 3: The Return Of Worldender;Rick;Morty, twenty people try to kill me every week. I end up getting high with half of 'em. I mean, check it out, Gear Head's here.
3;4;Vindicators 3: The Return Of Worldender;Gear Head;Hmm. Well, that's gonna shoot through me.
3;4;Vindicators 3: The Return Of Worldender;Beth;Morty, you're wearing a Vindicator jacket. Are you a little superhero now?
3;4;Vindicators 3: The Return Of Worldender;Morty;Everyone in the universe is a hero, Mom. Which is why we don't need jackets.  And I'm pretty sure we don't need Vindicators.
3;4;Vindicators 3: The Return Of Worldender;Gear Head;Don't mind if I do.  Hey, everybody! Look who's a Vindicator!
3;4;Vindicators 3: The Return Of Worldender;Summer;Man, Grandpa Rick must have gotten shitfaced.
3;4;Vindicators 3: The Return Of Worldender;Rick;Shut up, Summer.
3;4;Vindicators 3: The Return Of Worldender;Logic;Can't forget about the one who never seems to get a chance
3;4;Vindicators 3: The Return Of Worldender;Crowd;Noob-Noob!
3;4;Vindicators 3: The Return Of Worldender;Logic;All the bitches come around for...
3;4;Vindicators 3: The Return Of Worldender;Crowd;Noob-Noob!
3;4;Vindicators 3: The Return Of Worldender;Logic;His dick gets more visits than...
3;4;Vindicators 3: The Return Of Worldender;Crowd;YouTube!
3;4;Vindicators 3: The Return Of Worldender;Rick;Who the fuck is Noob-Noob?
3;4;Vindicators 3: The Return Of Worldender;Gear Girl #1;I can't believe we're getting gear cream with a Vindicator.
3;4;Vindicators 3: The Return Of Worldender;Gear Head;So, you girls in Gear college or Gear...
3;4;Vindicators 3: The Return Of Worldender;Gear Citizen;Alien terror attack!
3;4;Vindicators 3: The Return Of Worldender;Gear Head;Okay, sounds like a job for... me. I better go get into my alter ego.
3;4;Vindicators 3: The Return Of Worldender;Gear Girl #1;So cool!
3;4;Vindicators 3: The Return Of Worldender;Gear Girl #2;I know.
3;4;Vindicators 3: The Return Of Worldender;Gear Girl #1;Wait, what alter ego? He was already wearing the jacket.
3;4;Vindicators 3: The Return Of Worldender;Gear Head;Gotta know when to hold 'em and...
3;5;The Whirly Dirly Conspiracy;Rick;Jerry! Jerry, come on! We got to go! You got to come with me, Jerry!
3;5;The Whirly Dirly Conspiracy;Jerry;Rick?
3;5;The Whirly Dirly Conspiracy;Rick;Its important, Jerry. The fate of the galaxy rests on your shoulders. Lets go. Put some pants on. N-Never mind, theres no time for pants, Jerry. Ill make you a pair of pants on the way. Its a Rick and Jerry adventure! Rick and Jerry episode!
3;5;The Whirly Dirly Conspiracy;Rick;"Then I thought, Hey, what about Jerry? Hes Hes good with regular folk."" This is a real situation where where Where Jerry could really shine. ""Hes a master convincer."""""
3;5;The Whirly Dirly Conspiracy;Jerry;Rick, Im not an idiot. I know what this is.
3;5;The Whirly Dirly Conspiracy;Rick;"Oh. Okay, well, I told Morty, Look, parents get divorced. They get sad. Hell be fine,"" but I think hes worried youre gonna, you know Pbht! And you know how Morty gets when he gets emotional. It impedes my work. So, I told him Id take you out and give you a win."""
3;5;The Whirly Dirly Conspiracy;Jerry;Wait. My son asked you to take me on some kind of pity adventure to keep me from killing myself?
3;5;The Whirly Dirly Conspiracy;Rick;Wait, w-what did you think it was?
3;5;The Whirly Dirly Conspiracy;Jerry;An execution.
3;5;The Whirly Dirly Conspiracy;Rick;Geez! You really do need a win.
3;5;The Whirly Dirly Conspiracy;Jerry;No! I-I dont know. I mean, you never made me the pants, so
3;5;The Whirly Dirly Conspiracy;Rick;So, you thought I was gonna drive you into the middle of the galaxy and shove you into the vacuum of space with your dick hanging out? And were seeing how youd act if that were about to happen? I mean, Ill make you the pants right now. Take me two seconds to make you pants.
3;5;The Whirly Dirly Conspiracy;Jerry;I have pants at home!
3;5;The Whirly Dirly Conspiracy;Rick;Jerry, if I make pants, theyll be better than your pants at home. Also, if I wanted to kill you
3;5;The Whirly Dirly Conspiracy;Jerry;Yeah, I get it. It would be amazing. Please, take me home. Ill tell my son we had an amazing adventure.
3;5;The Whirly Dirly Conspiracy;Rick;Well, if its all the same, could we go get our story straight? Because youre a terrible liar.
3;5;The Whirly Dirly Conspiracy;Jerry;You called me a master convincer!
3;5;The Whirly Dirly Conspiracy;Rick;You believed me?
3;5;The Whirly Dirly Conspiracy;Jerry;Huh. This seems kind of fancy.
3;5;The Whirly Dirly Conspiracy;Rick;Jerry, for all you know, this is the equivalent of an alien truck stop. You have no frame of reference. Youre in a universe beyond your imagining. But, yes, it is super fancy. I mean, my job here is to make Morty happy. Im not gonna take you somewhere dangerous.
3;5;The Whirly Dirly Conspiracy;Shnoopy Bloopers;Rick Sanchez. I told you if I ever saw your face in here again, I would stick you like the pig you are.
3;5;The Whirly Dirly Conspiracy;Rick;Shnoopy Bloopers, I told you if you tried Thered be two funerals.
3;5;The Whirly Dirly Conspiracy;Jerry;Aaah!! Someone? Uh, someone? Someone!
3;5;The Whirly Dirly Conspiracy;Shnoopy Bloopers;My friend! It has been too long.
3;5;The Whirly Dirly Conspiracy;Rick;Oh, its great to see you again, buddy! Yeah, youre doing it.
3;5;The Whirly Dirly Conspiracy;Shnoopy Bloopers;Mr. Sanchez gets anything he wants!
3;5;The Whirly Dirly Conspiracy;Rick;The resorts covered in an immortality field. You cant die here. Thats the gimmick.
3;5;The Whirly Dirly Conspiracy;Jerry;Okay, but still Bad parenting.
3;5;The Whirly Dirly Conspiracy;Rick;Hey, rich a-holes are rich a-holes. They all pay top dollar to come here and enjoy a consequence-free vacation. No death, no disease, no dismemberment. Cant even have a heart attack.
3;5;The Whirly Dirly Conspiracy;Jerry;Got it. The perfect place to take the most fragile being in the universe.
3;5;The Whirly Dirly Conspiracy;Rick;I can tell you expect me to refute that, but its right on the money. If I come home without you, I doubt Mortys gonna let me off the hook.
3;5;The Whirly Dirly Conspiracy;Jerry;Yeah, but what if you came home with Jeff Goldblum.
3;5;The Whirly Dirly Conspiracy;Jerry;"Jeff Goldblum? What the are you talking about, Jerry? Jesus! Holy shit! Yo, whats up, Big Chill""?! Dont go into the telepod!"""
3;5;The Whirly Dirly Conspiracy;Jerry;Hey, maybe we would have fun on a fake adventure.
3;5;The Whirly Dirly Conspiracy;Rick;On a fake adventure.
3;5;The Whirly Dirly Conspiracy;Jerry;Speaking of What are we gonna tell Morty?
3;5;The Whirly Dirly Conspiracy;Rick;I dont know. But whatever it is, were gonna need a couple more of these babies!
3;5;The Whirly Dirly Conspiracy;Beth;Whats wrong?
3;5;The Whirly Dirly Conspiracy;Summer;Mom, do you think Im hot?
3;5;The Whirly Dirly Conspiracy;Beth;I dont think thats something that matters.
3;5;The Whirly Dirly Conspiracy;Summer;So, Im not hot?!
3;5;The Whirly Dirly Conspiracy;Beth;Im saying the part of you that cares about that is a part you shouldnt give any energy to.
3;5;The Whirly Dirly Conspiracy;Summer;Thats not an answer!
3;5;The Whirly Dirly Conspiracy;Beth;Because Im not an issue of Cosmo, okay? Im your mother and a doctor, and
3;5;The Whirly Dirly Conspiracy;Summer;Im hideous!
3;5;The Whirly Dirly Conspiracy;Morty;Geez. Whats with her?
3;5;The Whirly Dirly Conspiracy;Beth;Teenage-girl stuff.
3;5;The Whirly Dirly Conspiracy;Morty;Is that a hoof collage?
3;5;The Whirly Dirly Conspiracy;Beth;Its perfectly legal, if thats what youre wondering.
3;5;The Whirly Dirly Conspiracy;Morty;Cool zies.
3;5;The Whirly Dirly Conspiracy;Summer;"We just dont have anything in common any more, Summer."" Oh, yeah, Ethan? What do you have in common with Tricia Lange? A mutual love of French cinema? The belief that a carbon tax is the only viable solution to climate change? Or could it be her massive stripper titties?! There it is.Boob-ya!"""
3;5;The Whirly Dirly Conspiracy;Jerry;And thats when Malakai the Squid came, rips off his face, and beneath it is my face.
3;5;The Whirly Dirly Conspiracy;Three-headed Fellow At The Bar;I liked it.
3;5;The Whirly Dirly Conspiracy;Jerry;Thank you, sir.
3;5;The Whirly Dirly Conspiracy;Rick;Yeah, of course he likes it. Look at him. Mother got two heads and three trunks.
3;5;The Whirly Dirly Conspiracy;Jerry;All right, well put a pin in it. Im gonna go take a leak.  What the?! My hands are dry! My hands are dry!
3;5;The Whirly Dirly Conspiracy;Risotto Groupon;My name is Risotto Groupon. I am the assistant general manager of the restaurant.
3;5;The Whirly Dirly Conspiracy;Jerry;Do you have any comment cards, because I might have some thoughts.
3;5;The Whirly Dirly Conspiracy;Risotto Groupon;My kingdom was usurped by force with weapons and technology supplied by your father-in-law!
3;5;The Whirly Dirly Conspiracy;Jerry;Hey, he usurped my kingdom, too, man. He basically got me kicked out of my home, stole my family.
3;5;The Whirly Dirly Conspiracy;Risotto Groupon;Then we are brothers, and you have wondered what your life could have been without Rick.
3;5;The Whirly Dirly Conspiracy;Jerry;Wondered? Sure. I mean, Ive wondered about having a vagina.
3;5;The Whirly Dirly Conspiracy;Risotto Groupon;Would you help me kill him?
3;5;The Whirly Dirly Conspiracy;Jerry;What? No! Hes my wifes father. Move on.
3;5;The Whirly Dirly Conspiracy;Risotto Groupon;Do you like theme-park rides?
3;5;The Whirly Dirly Conspiracy;Jerry;Oh, you really moved on.
3;5;The Whirly Dirly Conspiracy;Risotto Groupon;There is a popular attraction here called the Whirly Dirly. Between the first whirly and the third dirly, the ride dips just outside the immortality field.
3;5;The Whirly Dirly Conspiracy;Jerry;Youre asking me to lure Rick to his death?
3;5;The Whirly Dirly Conspiracy;Risotto Groupon;Im only asking you to go on a ride with Rick, get off the ride without Rick, and go home to your family, where you can wonder about having a vagina.
3;5;The Whirly Dirly Conspiracy;Jerry;Okay, okay, that was a very specific example pulled from thin air. I dont want to be known as the vagina guy.
3;5;The Whirly Dirly Conspiracy;Restaurant Employee;Risotto, youre needed. Someone ordered the Nuzzy Guzzy Fresh and Fluzzy Special.
3;5;The Whirly Dirly Conspiracy;Risotto Groupon;Look, Im not like Rick, so youre free to do as you please. But there comes a time in every mans life when he must choose the foundation on which his legacy will be built One of compromise or one of blood.
3;5;The Whirly Dirly Conspiracy;Summer;OH, YEAH. THATS WHAT IM TALKING ABOUT. OOPS! OKAY, A LITTLE MORE ON THE OTHER SIDE THEN. OH, COME ON! OH, GEEZ! AAH! STOP!

3;6;Rest and Ricklaxation;Tricia;So, Jessica, I heard you broke up with Brad.
3;6;Rest and Ricklaxation;Holly;"Who are you gonna date; now that you can date anyone?"
3;6;Rest and Ricklaxation;Jessica;I dont know. I mean, obviously if someone special comes along. B-But I mean really special, like, nothing Ive even remotely considered in the past.
3;6;Rest and Ricklaxation;Morty;Holyshitholyshitholyshit.
3;6;Rest and Ricklaxation;Tricia;I want that kind of love like that docking kind of love.
3;6;Rest and Ricklaxation;Holly;Oh, yeah.
3;6;Rest and Ricklaxation;Tricia;Like, penis in the foreskin kind of love Mm-hmm just, like, warm, just like...
3;6;Rest and Ricklaxation;Morty;Hey...  ah...
3;6;Rest and Ricklaxation;Rick;Everybody, fuck off. Morty, I need your help. W-W-W-We We need to go on a quick adventure.
3;6;Rest and Ricklaxation;Morty;You said I could go to school today.
3;6;Rest and Ricklaxation;Rick;That was before I needed something, Morty. Theres a plasma shard in the Abadango Cluster. A princess has it. If I get it, Ill be awesome.
3;6;Rest and Ricklaxation;Morty;Weve been going non-stop, Rick. Its not healthy. You know, these are my teenage years. I-I just found out Jessicas single.
3;6;Rest and Ricklaxation;Rick;Oh, thats Wow, Morty. Wow. What an exciting life you lead.  Lets go. In and out, 20 minutes adventure.
3;6;Rest and Ricklaxation;Morty;Theyre on our tail!
3;6;Rest and Ricklaxation;Rick;Steady, Morty. Five cetons. Steady, God damn it! Two cetons.
3;6;Rest and Ricklaxation;Morty;Wha!
3;6;Rest and Ricklaxation;Rick;Fire!
3;6;Rest and Ricklaxation;Rick;Pull up, Morty, pull up! Pull up!
3;6;Rest and Ricklaxation;Rick; Fuck.
3;6;Rest and Ricklaxation;Rick;Oh, fuck! Fuck! Ahh! Ahh!
3;6;Rest and Ricklaxation;Morty;I cant fucking do this anymore!
3;6;Rest and Ricklaxation;Rick;That was seriously fucked up. We almost died.
3;6;Rest and Ricklaxation;Morty;So you agree?
3;6;Rest and Ricklaxation;Rick;Fuck yes! That w... T-This was insane! That was pure luck. I was not in control of that situation at all.
3;6;Rest and Ricklaxation;Rick;Look at this, Morty. Look at my fucking hand. Look at this shit.
3;6;Rest and Ricklaxation;Morty;Why do you... Keep doing this to us?!
3;6;Rest and Ricklaxation;Rick;I dont know, Morty. Maybe I hate myself, maybe I think I deserve to die. I-I-I-I dont I dont know!
3;6;Rest and Ricklaxation;Rick;We need a vacation.
3;6;Rest and Ricklaxation;Rick;Isnt that something?
3;6;Rest and Ricklaxation;Morty;You were right. Best day spa in the galaxy.
3;6;Rest and Ricklaxation;Rick;It's not even cruel, either. These things are just doing what they do in the wild. It loves swallowing stressed-out creatures for 20 minutes and then puking them up.
3;6;Rest and Ricklaxation;Morty;My whole bodys like a babys ass.
3;6;Rest and Ricklaxation;Alien;Complimentary psychological detox? Removes all your cognitive toxins,  purifies your system.
3;6;Rest and Ricklaxation;Rick;Oof, this guy on commission or something?
3;6;Rest and Ricklaxation;Morty;I dont think. Are you on commission?
3;6;Rest and Ricklaxation;Alien;Were not on  commission. We get  paid by the hour. Theres no incentive really-
3;6;Rest and Ricklaxation;Rick;Oh, my god. Okay, listen. W-W-W-Well try the machine, but but Id like you to try something. Try swallowing the giant ball of snot thats dangling around in the back of your throat.  Its disgusting. Nobody wants to hear that. Ahem. Ahem! Thats what you do.
3;6;Rest and Ricklaxation;Morty;Okay, Rick, come on. Enough.
3;6;Rest and Ricklaxation;Rick;Wow, did you hear me bite that guy's head off? Geez, I really need to chill.
3;6;Rest and Ricklaxation;Morty;Maybe you should go through twice.
3;6;Rest and Ricklaxation;Rick;All right, mister comedy man, you dont have to bust my balls. Youre not helping things.
3;6;Rest and Ricklaxation;Morty;Rick, is this thing supposed to be making this no-
3;6;Rest and Ricklaxation;Toxic Rick; Morty!
3;6;Rest and Ricklaxation;Toxic Morty;  R-Rick.
3;6;Rest and Ricklaxation;Toxic Rick;Morty! 
3;6;Rest and Ricklaxation;Toxic Morty;Ugh! What Happened?
3;6;Rest and Ricklaxation;Toxic Rick;We blew up, idiot! Are you really that stupid? Obviously the guy I yelled at overloaded the machine. It takes more than that to kill Rick and Morty, motherfucker!
3;6;Rest and Ricklaxation;Toxic Rick;But this might do it. Run, Morty!
3;6;Rest and Ricklaxation;Toxic Morty;E-Everything hurts!
3;6;Rest and Ricklaxation;Toxic Rick;Thats because youre worthless!  Jesus, how big was this explosion? Im a genius. I dont have time for this shit.
3;6;Rest and Ricklaxation;Toxic Morty; W-W-Were in Hell, arent we, Rick?
3;6;Rest and Ricklaxation;Toxic Rick; Youre so stupid, Morty. Youre an  idiot. Theres no such thing as Hell.
3;6;Rest and Ricklaxation;Toxic Morty;I believe you, but I just want to die.
3;6;Rest and Ricklaxation;Toxic Rick;You can die when I say so. I control you. I control the universe! Why am I bragging about that? I have nothing to prove. Im surrounded by inferior pieces of shit and 
3;6;Rest and Ricklaxation;Toxic Rick;Toxins. Were not in Hell, Morty.  Were in the detoxifier. The machine didnt blow up. It worked normally.  It removed our toxins.  Were the toxins.
3;6;Rest and Ricklaxation;Toxic Morty; Aaaaaaaahhhhhhh!
3;6;Rest and Ricklaxation;Toxic Rick;Are you listening, you stupid little garbage person?!  We're what got removed!
3;6;Rest and Ricklaxation;Alien;I hope you both found that detox sufficiently relaxing.
3;6;Rest and Ricklaxation;Rick;Hey, man, listen Those comments I made about your throat?
3;6;Rest and Ricklaxation;Alien;  Its all good.
3;6;Rest and Ricklaxation;Rick;Its nice of you to let me off the hook. Its still unacceptable behavior, and I do regret it.
3;6;Rest and Ricklaxation;Alien;Believe me, man, Ive been working here a long time. I get it.
3;6;Rest and Ricklaxation;Morty;Hey, uh, you mind if I put on some music?
3;6;Rest and Ricklaxation;Rick;Not at all.
3;6;Rest and Ricklaxation;Radio;Grab my terrifolds...
3;6;Rest and Ricklaxation;Rick;What is that?
3;6;Rest and Ricklaxation;Morty;I just hit shuffle.
3;6;Rest and Ricklaxation;Rick;Are you kidding?
3;6;Rest and Ricklaxation;Morty;Haha.
3;6;Rest and Ricklaxation;Rick;This universe.  Oh, excuse me.
3;6;Rest and Ricklaxation;Morty;We should listen to one random song a day, you know? Wed end up hearing more songs we didnt like, but wed discover a lot more that we did.
3;6;Rest and Ricklaxation;Rick;That is an interesting concept. You know, it makes me wonder if theres an algorithmic expression that could achieve the ideal ratio. Pfft! Listen to me, trying to calculate happiness over here.
3;6;Rest and Ricklaxation;Morty;Hoo, if anyone could, Rick.
3;6;Rest and Ricklaxation;Rick;Hey, heres something no science could measure. Im real proud to be your grandpa, Morty.
3;6;Rest and Ricklaxation;Morty;Thanks, Rick. I love you.
3;6;Rest and Ricklaxation;Toxic Rick;Yeah, motherfucker! Yeah! Get it! Get some! Right up your fucking bitch ass, you fuck! Guess who just discovered a new element?! You think you could do that, Morty? You think anyone but me could do that ever in a billion years? Do you think if God existed he could do it? The answer is no. If God exists, its fucking me!
3;6;Rest and Ricklaxation;Toxic Morty;Yes, Rick. I-I agree, Rick.
3;6;Rest and Ricklaxation;Toxic Rick;While you were flapping your parasitic turd holster, I discovered the toxic equivalent of electricity, Morty. What do you think about that?
3;6;Rest and Ricklaxation;Toxic Morty;Uh I th-I think my voice is annoying.
3;6;Rest and Ricklaxation;Toxic Rick;It is, and its your best quality.
3;6;Rest and Ricklaxation;Toxic Morty; So true.
3;6;Rest and Ricklaxation;Mr. Goldenfold;Now, who can tell me the common denominator of these two factions? You dont know or yall just bored?
3;6;Rest and Ricklaxation;Morty;Hey, listen, you know, wh-If were all bored over here, wouldnt the common denominator be you?
3;6;Rest and Ricklaxation;Mr. Goldenfold;Damn, Morty. Thats hilarious. Normally I would come down on any kind of disruption, but it seems to represent a positive change for your character. Class dismissed!
3;6;Rest and Ricklaxation;Off screen student;Awesome, Morty!
3;6;Rest and Ricklaxation;Student with glasses;You done good, Morty. 
3;6;Rest and Ricklaxation;Off screen student 2;Oh yeah!
3;6;Rest and Ricklaxation;Female student;Thanks for the advice, Morty.
3;6;Rest and Ricklaxation;Morty;You got it.
3;6;Rest and Ricklaxation;Female student 2;I did it, Morty!
3;6;Rest and Ricklaxation;Morty;I knew you could.
3;6;Rest and Ricklaxation;Mitch;Hey, Morty, remember yesterday when I couldnt play the trombone? Well, check this out! 
3;6;Rest and Ricklaxation;Morty; Just like I told you, Mitch. The music was in your heart the whole time.
3;6;Rest and Ricklaxation;Female student;Stupid hat Wish I had the courage to just be myself.
3;6;Rest and Ricklaxation;Female Student; There you are.
3;6;Rest and Ricklaxation;Bully;You might have all these idiots fooled, but I know youre still the same pathetic loser hiding behind a confident facade. I know that because Im doing the same thing, brother. Im not alone anymore!
3;6;Rest and Ricklaxation;Jessica;Hey, Morty. Word around school is youve become super healthy.
3;6;Rest and Ricklaxation;Morty;I dont know about all that. I do, however, know that I have a pretty bad case of havent taken you to dinner-itis. Might be fatal. Hahaha!
3;6;Rest and Ricklaxation;Rick;Hey, kids. Uh, hope Im not interrupting. Morty, a moment of your time?
3;6;Rest and Ricklaxation;Morty;Happy to help, Rick.
3;6;Rest and Ricklaxation;Rick;I hate to bug you with this, but after our morning hike I started receiving very faint, highly unusual transmissions on my sub ether phone. Listen.
3;6;Rest and Ricklaxation;Morty;Its a bad phone. Chuck it. I downgraded to a clamshell for emergencies only. You know, if if if somethings worth saying, I-its worth eye contact.
3;6;Rest and Ricklaxation;Rick;Uh, I-I-I traced the source of the call back to the spa we went to, Morty. I thought I could hear a voice in there, so I enhanced it, a-and listen.
3;6;Rest and Ricklaxation;Toxic Rick;Hey, asshole!
3;6;Rest and Ricklaxation;Toxic Morty;Oh, man!
3;6;Rest and Ricklaxation;Toxic Rick;Remember us?
3;6;Rest and Ricklaxation;Toxic Morty;Oh, I dont like confrontation!
3;6;Rest and Ricklaxation;Toxic Rick;You fucked us, you pieces of garbage! Thats right, youre fucking garbage, not us. Im a fucking genius and a god. You really think this thing can hold me? Im gonna rip your throat...
3;6;Rest and Ricklaxation;Rick;Morty, what if the toxic parts of us have their own identities, their own will to live?
3;6;Rest and Ricklaxation;Rick;W-What if mine shares my intelligence and devised a way to reach out to us?
3;6;Rest and Ricklaxation;Morty;Sounds like hes in a lot of pain. Lot. O. Pain. But, you know, you shouldnt have to deal with that, man. You know, l-lets work off your trauma with some urban spin yoga. Its amazing. You do yoga on a bike, but you have an at-risk preteen-
3;6;Rest and Ricklaxation;Rick;I dont think I can just blow this off, Morty. If I had known it worked this way, I wouldnt have detoxed. Well, I would have because I was toxic. Now Im detoxed and Im accountable to my toxins, right? I-Its a dilemma.
3;6;Rest and Ricklaxation;Morty;I think I know what to do. 
3;6;Rest and Ricklaxation;Rick;Morty!
3;6;Rest and Ricklaxation;Morty;Rick! Haha.  You know, the only problem here is a big fat brain that misses eating all them big fat problems. Focus on the good thing. Trust me, things are good. Taking that away from me, heh. That wouldnt be healthy.
3;6;Rest and Ricklaxation;Morty;Hahaha! Hahahaha! Oh, man. Worlds Greatest Grandpa, for reals.  Its not just a coffee cup for you, bud. Youre legit. 
3;6;Rest and Ricklaxation;Morty;I love drums. I never took drum lessons. Why? Limitations. We are addicted to our own limitations. How amazing is that? Is the kale prepared in the kitchen? Ill have a water.
3;6;Rest and Ricklaxation;Jessica;"Uh How is the cru-dite?"""""
3;6;Rest and Ricklaxation;Waiter;Crudité. Its a cup of carrot sticks.
3;6;Rest and Ricklaxation;Morty;Ha! Its okay! Pronounce it however you want. Words are just things. Please. Thank you. Were having a conversation.
3;6;Rest and Ricklaxation;Morty;God, I am so excited to finally have dinner with you. You know how long Ive been waiting for this? Its like, whew! I-I-I wish youd shut up, though. Just kidding. You know, youre so quiet. Whats wrong? W-Why dont you tell me about yourself? Whats the atmosphere like on planet Jessica? Wheres the equator, what are the vacations, a-and the holidays? I mean, you know, haha, are they the same time? Talk to me.
3;6;Rest and Ricklaxation;Jessica;Well I... like this restaurant.
3;6;Rest and Ricklaxation;Morty;Holy shit! Holy shit! We have a moron over here! Im an idiot. I cant believe I havent thought of this. You have to do this detox thing I did. Its an alien spa, you go through it, fwoos-s-s-ssh, lasers, bwaa-bwaa-bwaa, wheeew wheeew! Sucks everything out. Everything that was holding me back, everything bad, I mean, it just sluuuurp! Hahaha! Right?
3;6;Rest and Ricklaxation;Jessica; Cooooool.  Oh, my God! I cant believe this.
3;6;Rest and Ricklaxation;Morty;Yeah, phones are awful, I downgraded to- 
3;6;Rest and Ricklaxation;Jessica;I totally forgot my I have a thing, and...
3;6;Rest and Ricklaxation;Morty;Things are good.
3;6;Rest and Ricklaxation;Jessica;You know what? Why am I doing that? Thats more rude than the truth. Look, Im sorry, Morty. I just dont think...
3;6;Rest and Ricklaxation;Morty;Do not. Even. You have no need to explain. Its all good.
3;6;Rest and Ricklaxation;Jessica;I think youd get bored with me. 
3;6;Rest and Ricklaxation;Morty;E-Exactly. Look, the sparks arent flying. This is what dating is for, you know? First date, no sparks. No damage, no worries. Life is a highway. Were gonna ride it all night lonnngg!
3;6;Rest and Ricklaxation;Morty;"Gonna eat some crudite. Mmm! Is this organic? Mmm.  All right. You know, the evening continues.  Okay, here we go."""
3;6;Rest and Ricklaxation;Morty;Maam, Im afraid I have some bad news for you. Your moneys no good here. Haha!  Ill Ill get the next round, sir.
3;6;Rest and Ricklaxation;Stacy;Arent you a child?
3;6;Rest and Ricklaxation;Morty;Only in the ways that matter. Morty.
3;6;Rest and Ricklaxation;Stacy; Stacy.
3;6;Rest and Ricklaxation;Morty;Ive been watching you drink, Stacy. I get the feeling youve got a hard job. I wonder what it takes to please you. Thats the job I want Part time, full time, I want to be good at it, bad at it, I want to get promoted, fired, corner office, hostile takeover, workplace accident Im on my knees, Stacy. Praying, worshipping, begging, whatever you want.  What do you think about that?
3;6;Rest and Ricklaxation;Stacy; Okay. Fuck it.
3;6;Rest and Ricklaxation;Morty;Tink.
3;6;Rest and Ricklaxation;Morty; Mm! Lets ask my grandpa. Hes a scientist.
3;6;Rest and Ricklaxation;Morty;"Hey, Rick, are you familiar with Ben Wa"" technology?"""
3;6;Rest and Ricklaxation;Rick; Morty, great news. I went back to the spa and they let me purchase the containment unit from their detoxifier.
3;6;Rest and Ricklaxation;Morty;Why?
3;6;Rest and Ricklaxation;Toxic Rick; Because were coming home, bitch!
3;6;Rest and Ricklaxation;Morty;What is this?
3;6;Rest and Ricklaxation;Toxic Rick;This is the parts of your pussy grandpa that keep it real. Oh oh, and I think you dropped something, too! 
3;6;Rest and Ricklaxation;Toxic Morty;I dont want to be on camera. Im ugly and gross, please.
3;6;Rest and Ricklaxation;Stacy;Should I go?
3;6;Rest and Ricklaxation;Morty;Youre your own person, Stacy.
3;6;Rest and Ricklaxation;Stacy;Then Id like to stay.
3;6;Rest and Ricklaxation;Morty;Rick, please tell me youre not trying to put that stuff back inside of us.
3;6;Rest and Ricklaxation;Rick;Morty, Im sorry. That stuff is alive and it belongs with us. We yanked them from their homes and locked them in a can. 
3;6;Rest and Ricklaxation;Toxic Rick;Motherfucker!
3;6;Rest and Ricklaxation;Rick;See? Theyre living in pain.
3;6;Rest and Ricklaxation;Morty;Thats what they do, Rick, they live in pain. They are pain, you know? They theyre all the bad parts of us, which, by the way, includes our dishonesty, so how do you know this isnt all some sort of crazy trick?
3;6;Rest and Ricklaxation;Toxic Rick;Oh, so now because Im made entirely of toxins Im also a liar? Fuck you, you little sociopath.  You hear this, Morty?
3;6;Rest and Ricklaxation;Toxic Morty;Oh, everybody hates me. I can tell. Y-You all hate me.
3;6;Rest and Ricklaxation;Toxic Rick; All right, shut up, Morty. Healthy Rick, are we doing this or what?
3;6;Rest and Ricklaxation;Rick;Yep. Sorry, Morty. I need you to step into the booth. 
3;6;Rest and Ricklaxation;Toxic Rick;Dont negotiate with that little turd, dummy. Youre the Rick. You need to show dominance. Morty, booth, now. 
3;6;Rest and Ricklaxation;Rick;Booth! Come on, Morty.
3;6;Rest and Ricklaxation;Morty;Dont touch me!
3;6;Rest and Ricklaxation;Rick;Morty, do the healthy thing and voluntarily retoxify yourself. 
3;6;Rest and Ricklaxation;Morty;Nooooo!
3;6;Rest and Ricklaxation;Stacy;Is it wrong if I think this is kind of hot?
3;6;Rest and Ricklaxation;Morty;Let me out of here! Stacy, help! Open the door!
3;6;Rest and Ricklaxation;Stacy;I need to hear our safe word, Morty.
3;6;Rest and Ricklaxation;Morty;Sea Cucumber! Sea Cucumber!
3;6;Rest and Ricklaxation;Rick;What are you doing?
3;6;Rest and Ricklaxation;Stacy;Ill do anything for you, Morty.
3;6;Rest and Ricklaxation;Rick;No!
3;6;Rest and Ricklaxation;Toxic Rick;It worked! Haha! Yes! That idiot believed every word. Now lets see how he enjoys living in that shit tank.
3;6;Rest and Ricklaxation;Toxic Rick;Hes right behind me, isnt he? 
3;6;Rest and Ricklaxation;Toxic Morty;Hes in front of you.
3;6;Rest and Ricklaxation;Toxic Rick;Oh.  My eyes are still adjusting.
3;6;Rest and Ricklaxation;Stacy; Uh, is this like a sex dungeon? I guess I shouldve been paying attention.
3;6;Rest and Ricklaxation;Toxic Rick;After 70 years of being bottled up inside a  sentimental jackass, I finally get to live my own life.
3;6;Rest and Ricklaxation;Rick;You said we were merging.
3;6;Rest and Ricklaxation;Toxic Rick;I lied, dumbass! I lie about everything! Why would I ever re-merge with a pussy like you?
3;6;Rest and Ricklaxation;Rick;So you were just gonna trap us in that tank? T-That was your plan?
3;6;Rest and Ricklaxation;Toxic Rick;Not was, motherfucker, still is.
3;6;Rest and Ricklaxation;Morty; Kill him, Rick!
3;6;Rest and Ricklaxation;Toxic Morty; I dont like this! This is scary!
3;6;Rest and Ricklaxation;Rick; All right, you asked for it.
3;6;Rest and Ricklaxation;Toxic Rick;Did I ask for this?  Did I ask for this?  Huh? Did I?
3;6;Rest and Ricklaxation;Groin System 6000;Assessing threat to groin.
3;6;Rest and Ricklaxation;Toxic Rick;Groin System 6000. Kill him!
3;6;Rest and Ricklaxation;Groin System 6000; That... is my groins user.
3;6;Rest and Ricklaxation;Toxic Rick;Believe me, I got a lot more use out of that thing than he ever did.
3;6;Rest and Ricklaxation;Groin System 6000;You know what? Not my table. 
3;6;Rest and Ricklaxation;Mrs. Pancakes;You do know me.
3;6;Rest and Ricklaxation;Summer;What the hell, Grandpa Rick?
3;6;Rest and Ricklaxation;Toxic Rick;Fuck you, Summer!
3;6;Rest and Ricklaxation;Rick;Sorry, Summer!
3;6;Rest and Ricklaxation;Rick;Okay, okay, take it easy. Dont do it.
3;6;Rest and Ricklaxation;Toxic Rick;I love you. Good boy. Daddys little boy.
3;6;Rest and Ricklaxation;Rick;Summer, get out of here! Go!
3;6;Rest and Ricklaxation;Toxic Rick;Oh, whos that?
3;6;Rest and Ricklaxation;Toxic Rick; Whos that over there? Oh, no.
3;6;Rest and Ricklaxation;Toxic Rick;You see the bad man in front of you? Youre a good little boy, youre gonna get him. Youre gonna get him.
3;6;Rest and Ricklaxation;Toxic Rick;Ahh! Son of a...  
3;6;Rest and Ricklaxation;Toxic Rick;Nice try, asshole.
3;6;Rest and Ricklaxation;Rick;We can resolve  our issues. We dont need to resort to over-the-top- Aah!
3;6;Rest and Ricklaxation;Toxic Morty;I-I did it, Rick. I got the tank! I-Im a piece of shit, but I got the tank!
3;6;Rest and Ricklaxation;Toxic Rick;Youre going in that tank, motherfucker. Youre gonna  live in that toxic shit wasteland like I had to do!
3;6;Rest and Ricklaxation;Toxic Morty;Ahh! Ow!  
3;6;Rest and Ricklaxation;Toxic Rick;Thats right, motherfucker! Youre going in that fucki-
3;6;Rest and Ricklaxation;Beth; Dads?
3;6;Rest and Ricklaxation;Rick;Okay, just Just leave her out of it.
3;6;Rest and Ricklaxation;Beth;Whats going on?
3;6;Rest and Ricklaxation;Toxic Rick;All right, fuck this. Time for plan B If I cant trap you in a toxic world, 
3;6;Rest and Ricklaxation;Morty;Ahh!
3;6;Rest and Ricklaxation;Toxic Rick;Ill just make the whole world toxic. 
3;6;Rest and Ricklaxation;Rick;Its okay, girls. I-Im so sorry I put us in danger with some of my behavior. I-If youd like I can go out in the g-garden, pick some fresh basil, and make us a nice Scallopini.
3;6;Rest and Ricklaxation;Beth;What did the booger version of you mean when he said he was going to make the whole world toxic?
3;6;Rest and Ricklaxation;Rick;Believe me, sweetie, that mans motivations are a mystery.
3;6;Rest and Ricklaxation;Morty;Screw that, Rick. We got to stop him. Whats the last thing youd think about doing with that tank thing?
3;6;Rest and Ricklaxation;Rick; Morty, I appreciate what youre trying to do, but its not our place, you know, to pick and choose which world gets saved from what apocalypse. Our our toxins have as much a right to their worldview as-
3;6;Rest and Ricklaxation;Rick;Morty, how is it healthy to slap me?
3;6;Rest and Ricklaxation;Morty;Obviously my version of health is a hell of a lot different from yours, you useless old turd.
3;6;Rest and Ricklaxation;Rick;Wait. Thats it.  How could that detox machine know the difference between healthy and sick for everything that goes through it? It cant. It must be by the individuals own definition of toxicity. That means...
3;6;Rest and Ricklaxation;Beth;Dad!
3;6;Rest and Ricklaxation;Morty;What the What the hell, Rick?
3;6;Rest and Ricklaxation;Rick; Ill explain on the way.
3;6;Rest and Ricklaxation;Toxic Rick;"This Moon Tower,"" Morty,  is the perfect height and metallic composition for the  amplification and beaming of toxic energies. What do you think about that, Morty? Are you excited about that, Morty?"""
3;6;Rest and Ricklaxation;Toxic Morty;Oh, man. Im just freaked out. I-Its too high up here.
3;6;Rest and Ricklaxation;Toxic Rick;Once I flip this switch, the entire world is gonna be just as toxic as us, baby. 
3;6;Rest and Ricklaxation;Priest;As we praise our loving Father-
3;6;Rest and Ricklaxation;Priest; God is a lie! We made him up for money!
3;6;Rest and Ricklaxation;Man; Santa Claus isnt real.  You were all mistakes!
3;6;Rest and Ricklaxation;Toxic Rick;Hahahahahaha! We fucking did it, Morty. Put your fucking hands in the air.  Yeah, you little piece of shit.
3;6;Rest and Ricklaxation;Rick;Remember me?
3;6;Rest and Ricklaxation;Toxic Rick;Didnt you learn last time that you cant beat me?
3;6;Rest and Ricklaxation;Rick;Yeah, I did. And then I learned something else.  This.
3;6;Rest and Ricklaxation;Toxic Morty;Ahh!!
3;6;Rest and Ricklaxation;Rick;That bullet is laced with an encrypted nanobotic virus that will disintegrate your Morty in about, ah, 20 minutes.
3;6;Rest and Ricklaxation;Toxic Rick;You think I give a shit?
3;6;Rest and Ricklaxation;Rick;I know you give a shit, dummy. Because I know I dont. Heres another thing I know. The decryption key that neutralizes the virus.  You want it? Come and get it. Merge with me and youll know how to save him.
3;6;Rest and Ricklaxation;Toxic Rick;Pfft. Come on, man. Ive been trapped in your pussy brain for 70 years of delusions, but this is the all-time weakest bluff that Ive ever-
3;6;Rest and Ricklaxation;Toxic Morty;Ow-Ohh!!
3;6;Rest and Ricklaxation;Toxic Rick; Jesus Christ! What are you doing?!
3;6;Rest and Ricklaxation;Morty;Hes cutting your time in half. 10 minutes.
3;6;Rest and Ricklaxation;Toxic Morty;Ohh! It hurts!
3;6;Rest and Ricklaxation;Toxic Rick;What is your problem?
3;6;Rest and Ricklaxation;Rick;Oh, I had all my problems removed my entitlement, my narcissism, my crippling loneliness, my irrational attachments.
3;6;Rest and Ricklaxation;Rick;They must be somewhere. They aint over here, bro.
3;6;Rest and Ricklaxation;Toxic Rick;Im not going back in there!
3;6;Rest and Ricklaxation;Rick;"Honestly, I dont care either way. I hate having you in me. And when I say honestly"" you can believe it, because we both know Im too healthy to lie. Watch."""
3;6;Rest and Ricklaxation;Toxic Rick;All right! Knock it off! Youre not impressing anyone.  Morty, not that I give a shit, but are you okay?
3;6;Rest and Ricklaxation;Toxic Morty;Jesus Christ, it hurts.
3;6;Rest and Ricklaxation;Toxic Rick;Relax, quit your bitching. Y-Youre gonna be fine. Grandpas here.
3;6;Rest and Ricklaxation;Rick;Hahahahahaha.
3;6;Rest and Ricklaxation;Toxic Rick;You think thats funny?
3;6;Rest and Ricklaxation;Rick;Y-You got to have a sense of humor about these things. Oh, wait, you cant. Youre literally incapable of seeing the bigger picture. I guess its just funny because youve never done anything but complain about me being in charge, but if I ever gave you the wheel wed be dead in five minutes.
3;6;Rest and Ricklaxation;Toxic Morty;Ah, Rick?
3;6;Rest and Ricklaxation;Rick;You poor, dumb, sick animal.
3;6;Rest and Ricklaxation;Toxic Morty;Augh... Rick?
3;6;Rest and Ricklaxation;Toxic Rick;Ahh!  Just do it! Just do it, you piece of-
3;6;Rest and Ricklaxation;Rick;Aaahhh! Im back, baby!  Regular Rick! Master of both worlds! Check it it out!  Excuse me.  Now well just reverse this hacky toxicity beam. Man, I really over think shit when Im angry.
3;6;Rest and Ricklaxation;Priest;God is not a lie.
3;6;Rest and Ricklaxation;Crying boy;Mommy! Mommy!
3;6;Rest and Ricklaxation;Rick; Ha! All right, Morty, now its time we re-merge your little ass.
3;6;Rest and Ricklaxation;Morty;Youre a better man than me, Rick. Im healthy enough to admit that!
3;6;Rest and Ricklaxation;Rick;That kid is a real piece of shit.
3;6;Rest and Ricklaxation;Toxic Morty;Y-Y-Youre gonna save me, right?
3;6;Rest and Ricklaxation;Rick;Part of me wanted to, Toxic Morty. Part of me really wanted to. 
3;6;Rest and Ricklaxation;Worker;Im telling you, these shares are hot.
3;6;Rest and Ricklaxation;Worker 2;Yeah. That sounds like a good idea. Its definitely a good idea.
3;6;Rest and Ricklaxation;Morty; Duane, Duane, Duane, I get it, now can you get me? Have I ever lied to you?  Thats right, and ask around, I never do, Duane.
3;6;Rest and Ricklaxation;Morty;Let me put this real simple. This stock is a beautiful redhead, recently single, not looking to date but ready to fall in love, and fate has put her locker two down from yours, Duane Two lockers down.  So step up or step off, Duane. Blue pill or red pill, whatll be, bro? Totally understand, Duane. Youre the boss.  Heinholz Biotech Million and a half at thirty-three. 
3;6;Rest and Ricklaxation;Worker in a red shirt; Heh.You little fucking monster.
3;6;Rest and Ricklaxation;Morty;Mmm! Is this organic? Mmm!  Go for Morty.
3;6;Rest and Ricklaxation;Jessica;Hi, Morty. Its Jessica. Look, can we just talk for a minute?
3;6;Rest and Ricklaxation;Morty;Is that how long it takes for Rick to trace my location?
3;6;Rest and Ricklaxation;Jessica;Come back, Morty. I miss you.
3;6;Rest and Ricklaxation;Morty;You miss the old me. You miss someone that loved you so much you never had to love em back.
3;6;Rest and Ricklaxation;Jessica;How do you know I dont want to love you?
3;6;Rest and Ricklaxation;Morty;Because Im not sick. 
3;6;Rest and Ricklaxation;Jacquelyn;Ex-girlfriend? Should I be jealous?
3;6;Rest and Ricklaxation;Morty;Theres nothing to be jealous of.
3;6;Rest and Ricklaxation;Jacquelyn;I just realized that Im scheduled to speak at that fundraiser on our date night. I can cancel.
3;6;Rest and Ricklaxation;Morty;Well be together. Thats a date.
3;6;Rest and Ricklaxation;Jacquelyn;You are the perfect man.  Oh, sweetie,  I think you hit the wrong button. You didnt hang up.
3;6;Rest and Ricklaxation;Morty;Huh. How bout that?
3;6;Rest and Ricklaxation;Rick;Sorry, tiny American Psycho,  time to take the opposite of your medicine.
3;6;Rest and Ricklaxation;Morty;Do what you got to do.
3;6;Rest and Ricklaxation;Morty;Oh! Ow! Ahh! 
3;6;Rest and Ricklaxation;Jessica;So, how do you feel, Morty?
3;6;Rest and Ricklaxation;Morty;Ah, geez. Im miserable.
3;6;Rest and Ricklaxation;Rick;Am I good or what?
3;6;Rest and Ricklaxation;Morty;I guess its worth it, though, to know how much you care.
3;6;Rest and Ricklaxation;Jessica;Care? Me? Morty, Im fine with you. I only did this for him. 
3;6;Rest and Ricklaxation;Rick;"You lying bitch. She kept coming to our house, Morty, and kept asking me. Did did d-did you get a new Morty yet?"""""
3;6;Rest and Ricklaxation;Jessica;Because you kept drunk dialing me and crying about it.
3;6;Rest and Ricklaxation;Rick;I wasnt crying!
3;6;Rest and Ricklaxation;Morty;Jacquelyn, I I-I-I wasnt who I said I was.
3;6;Rest and Ricklaxation;Jacquelyn;You werent a 14-year-old boy from the Midwest who ran away from his family and capitalized on his lack of conscience by becoming a stock broker?
3;6;Rest and Ricklaxation;Morty;Oh. I guess I was pretty up front about that, wasnt I?
3;6;Rest and Ricklaxation;Jacquelyn;You were up front about everything. You were my soul mate.
3;6;Rest and Ricklaxation;Morty;Well No-Not anymore. Ill, um Y-You can keep the apartment, and and and, uh the drones.
3;6;Rest and Ricklaxation;Rick;She cant keep the drones. They turn into a little Voltron robot. Theyre awesome.
3;6;Rest and Ricklaxation;Rick;You cant keep the drones.
3;6;Rest and Ricklaxation;Tricia;So, how was your date with Brad?
3;6;Rest and Ricklaxation;Jessica;It wasnt a date. We were just having lunch.
3;6;Rest and Ricklaxation;Holly;You guys are getting back together, arent you?
3;6;Rest and Ricklaxation;Rick;"Morty, I need your help on an adventure. Eh, need"" is a strong word. We need door stops, but a brick would work, too."""
3;6;Rest and Ricklaxation;Morty;Okay.
3;6;Rest and Ricklaxation;Jessica;Morty.
3;6;Rest and Ricklaxation;Jessica;Good to have you back.
3;6;Rest and Ricklaxation;Tricia;Have you ever been peed on before? Oh, my God. Yum.
3;6;Rest and Ricklaxation;Man;Although only a handful of moon towers remain today, they were popular in the late 19th century. An entire town could be illuminated by...  What the hell is this?
3;6;Rest and Ricklaxation;Stacy;Sea Cucumber! Sea Cucumber!!
3;7;Tales From The Citadel;Rick;Alright, Morty. You ready for our adventure to the lost city of Atlantis?
3;7;Tales From The Citadel;Morty;Ready as Ill ever be, Rick!
3;7;Tales From The Citadel;Rick;Oh, for fucks sake.
3;7;Tales From The Citadel;Rick K-22; Hello, Im Rick K-22. This is my Morty. Were going from reality to reality, asking Ricks to contribute to the Citadel of Ricks redevelopment fund.
3;7;Tales From The Citadel;Rick;What are you, stupid? Were done with the Citadel of Ricks. I was  never on board with it in the first place, thats why I murdered everyone in charge and left it to rot.
3;7;Tales From The Citadel;Rick K-22; Ohhh. That was you. 
3;7;Tales From The Citadel;Morty;They tried to murder him first.
3;7;Tales From The Citadel;Morty K-22;Oh geez. Well, youll be happy to know that... the Councils gone now.
3;7;Tales From The Citadel;Morty;Yeah, he knows. He murdered them.
3;7;Tales From The Citadel;Rick K-22;You wanna rein in your Morty?
3;7;Tales From The Citadel;Rick; Every day.
3;7;Tales From The Citadel;Morty K-22; The Citadel of Ricks redevelopment fund donates--
3;7;Tales From The Citadel;Rick K-22; Morty, hes not gonna  donate. Youre pitching the policemans ball to a black teenager here.  Lets go.
3;7;Tales From The Citadel;Rick;You dont have to be a dick.
3;7;Tales From The Citadel;Rick K-22;I think you know thats not true.
3;7;Tales From The Citadel;Morty;Geez. I didnt know there were still Ricks and Mortys living on the Citadel. I wonder what their day-to-day lives are like.
3;7;Tales From The Citadel;Rick; Well, you can keep wondering that while we go on our fun, fresh, self-contained adventure to Atlantis.  Anyone continuing to explore the Citadel is either stupid, or one of the unfortunate millions held hostage by their terrible ideas.
3;7;Tales From The Citadel;Morty;Man. Glad Im not one of them!
3;7;Tales From The Citadel;Rick from Citadel Morning News;News about the Citadel in the morning. Pretty self explanatory.
3;7;Tales From The Citadel;Rick D716-B;Good morning. Im Rick D716-B.
3;7;Tales From The Citadel;Rick D716;And Im Rick D716.
3;7;Tales From The Citadel;Rick D716-B;Must be nice.
3;7;Tales From The Citadel;Rick D716;Coming up! Gravity outages in East Sanchez Heights!
3;7;Tales From The Citadel;Rick D716-B;And, is your uranium-powered cellular matrix making you sick? The answer may not surprise you. Its yes, its uranium.
3;7;Tales From The Citadel;Rick D716;Those stories and more after this break.
3;7;Tales From The Citadel;Narrator;Sixteen iterations off the central finite curve, theres a Rick that works more with wood than polarity plating.
3;7;Tales From The Citadel;Narrator;His name is Simple Rick, but hes no dummy.
3;7;Tales From The Citadel;Narrator;He realized long ago that the greatest thing hed ever create was his daughter.
3;7;Tales From The Citadel;Young Beth;I love Daddy!
3;7;Tales From The Citadel;Narrator;We captured that moment and run it on a loop through Simple Ricks mind.
3;7;Tales From The Citadel;Narrator;And the chemical that makes his brain secrete goes into every Simple Ricks Simple Wafer Cookie.  Come home to the impossible flavor of your own completion. Come home to Simple Ricks.
3;7;Tales From The Citadel;Rick D716;Just one day remains before our newly democratic Citadel elects its first president. Its anyones race among the Rick candidates.
3;7;Tales From The Citadel;Rick D716-B;But a certain other candidate should be getting at least one vote for most adorable.
3;7;Tales From The Citadel;Rick D716;Thats right, the Morty Party candidates still in the race, and you just gotta love him for that.
3;7;Tales From The Citadel;Rick D716;Here you see him in his little Morty suit, waving. Isnt that adorable? Little jackass.
3;7;Tales From The Citadel;Rick D716-B;Uh, yeah, I think we actually have the audio for his speech here. Aw geez, aw man, Im gonna lose the election and stuff.
3;7;Tales From The Citadel;Campaign Manager Morty;We had a good run, sir, but I think its time to pull out of the race.
3;7;Tales From The Citadel;Candidate Morty;I feel pretty confident about tonights debate.
3;7;Tales From The Citadel;Campaign Manager Morty;You shouldnt, sir. You should be terrified.
3;7;Tales From The Citadel;Candidate Morty;Maybe you should find a little faith, young man.
3;7;Tales From The Citadel;Campaign Manager Morty;You dont pay me to have faith! And were the same age!
3;7;Tales From The Citadel;Cop Rick;Oh! S-sorry, I was expecting--
3;7;Tales From The Citadel;Cop Morty;A Rick partner? Lesson one, rookie, expect the unexpected. Now get in.
3;7;Tales From The Citadel;Morty;Mortys are human!
3;7;Tales From The Citadel;Cop Morty;Get the fuck off the car, you Rickless fuckin animal!
3;7;Tales From The Citadel;Morty;WHOA!! 
3;7;Tales From The Citadel;Cop Morty;The elections got these yellow shirts more riled up than a Picture Day Jessica.
3;7;Tales From The Citadel;Cop Rick;Thats pretty harsh, sir.
3;7;Tales From The Citadel;Cop Morty;So report me. Nobody gives a fuck.
3;7;Tales From The Citadel;Cop Rick;Look, Im just saying. Makes me a little sad to hear a Morty cop calling Mortys animals.
3;7;Tales From The Citadel;Cop Morty;Well, it makes me sad to see another Rick cop buying into his sensitivity training.
3;7;Tales From The Citadel;Cop Rick;Well, Im glad to know theres more like me.
3;7;Tales From The Citadel;Cop Morty;Oh, there was one. Why do you think that seat was empty?
3;7;Tales From The Citadel;Dispatch;Robbery at Fifth and  Avenue.
3;7;Tales From The Citadel;Cop Rick;Fifth and ? Thats Mortytown.
3;7;Tales From The Citadel;Cop Morty; Unit 7 responding.
3;7;Tales From The Citadel;Teacher Rick;"""Good idea, Rick."""
3;7;Tales From The Citadel;Students; Good idea, Rick.
3;7;Tales From The Citadel;Teacher Rick;"""This is a great adventure."""
3;7;Tales From The Citadel;Students;This is a great adventure.
3;7;Tales From The Citadel;Teacher Rick;"""I love being your new Morty."""
3;7;Tales From The Citadel;Students;I love being your new Mor...
3;7;Tales From The Citadel;Slick; Farty!
3;7;Tales From The Citadel;Teacher Rick;Very amusing, Mr. Smith. Almost as amusing as when your first Rick was decapitated on Zorpathion 9.  Or was that your third Rick? How many Ricks have you had?
3;7;Tales From The Citadel;Slick;Five
3;7;Tales From The Citadel;Teacher Rick;I see. So you are top of the class in something.  Tomorrow you will be transferred to your new Ricks. Hopefully, they will be your last. Yes, Slow Ri-- Tall Morty?
3;7;Tales From The Citadel;Tall Morty;Di-Did I gragitate this time yet?
3;7;Tales From The Citadel;Teacher Rick;Anythings possible, Tall Morty. Ugh
3;7;Tales From The Citadel;Lizard Morty;Guess we wont be seein each other after this, huh?
3;7;Tales From The Citadel;Slick;I say we make our last day count. I say we go to the Wishing Portal.
3;7;Tales From The Citadel;Glasses Morty;Thats a myth.
3;7;Tales From The Citadel;Fat Morty;Its not a myth! M-m-my first Ricks fourth Morty knew a Rick whose Morty went there.
3;7;Tales From The Citadel;Lizard Morty;If were not here for graduation, our butts are gonna end up in Mortytown.
3;7;Tales From The Citadel;Slick;I thought your last Rick fused you with a lizard, not a chicken.
3;7;Tales From The Citadel;Lizard Morty;Okay, fine. Im in.
3;7;Tales From The Citadel;Glasses Morty;Me too.
3;7;Tales From The Citadel;Fat Morty;What the hell?
3;7;Tales From The Citadel;Lizard Morty; I-I thought I saw a fly.
3;7;Tales From The Citadel;Supervisor Rick; Listen up, fucknuts! Ive been your supervisor for five years but all shitty things must come to an end, and I have been promoted to regional manager.  Yeah, I feel the same way. May we never meet again. Of course that makes the position of Supervisor available.  So as of next week, the ass youll be kissing will be that of  K-83,  affectionately known as Cool Rick.
3;7;Tales From The Citadel;Cool Rick;I know Im new to the Citadel and some of you might not think Ive put in my time, but what can I say? Im Cool Rick!  Yo, ha-ha-ha, check me out!
3;7;Tales From The Citadel;Supervisor Rick;Alright, knuckle--heads, any questions?  Alright then, back to work, you gold-Rickers.
3;7;Tales From The Citadel;Cop Morty;No Ricks, no families, high off their asses and runnin amok. Mortys are raised to be sidekicks. Without a side to kick, they just start kickin.
3;7;Tales From The Citadel;Morty Mart Morty;They were, they were about my height, around fourteen years old OH! Their shirts were yellow!
3;7;Tales From The Citadel;Cop Morty; Yeah, make sure you get that down.
3;7;Tales From The Citadel;Cop Rick;Any mutations? Augmentations? Three eyes, a tail, maybe a buzzcut?
3;7;Tales From The Citadel;Morty Mart Morty;No, just four normal Mortys.
3;7;Tales From The Citadel;Purple Trunk Morty;" Normal""?"""
3;7;Tales From The Citadel;Morty Mart Morty; Put it in your blog.
3;7;Tales From The Citadel;Cop Morty; Lemme turn over a few rocks.
3;7;Tales From The Citadel;Cop Morty;Aw geez, hey, whats goin on, fellas?
3;7;Tales From The Citadel;Morty 1;Aw geez, man, nothin man, were just hangin out and stuff.
3;7;Tales From The Citadel;Cop Morty;I hear that, ah geez, I guess Im supposed to be figuring out who robbed the store across the street but aw geez I dunno.
3;7;Tales From The Citadel;Morty 2; Ah geez man, that sucks that your Ricks makin you do that.
3;7;Tales From The Citadel;Cop Morty; Hes not my Rick. Hes my partner. Aw, geez.
3;7;Tales From The Citadel;Morty 1;Well, maybe the uniform makes a big difference. Who am I to say? To me, you just look like a sidekick.
3;7;Tales From The Citadel;Cop Morty;CALL ME A SIDEKICK ONE MORE TIME! CALL ME A SIDEKICK!!
3;7;Tales From The Citadel;Morty 2;Hey man! Cmon, aw geez!
3;7;Tales From The Citadel;Cop Morty;WANNA SEE HOW I PAINT A WALL?!
3;7;Tales From The Citadel;Morty 2;It was the Mortytown Locos, man! The Mortytown Locos!
3;7;Tales From The Citadel;Cop Rick;Do you realize how many codes you just violated?
3;7;Tales From The Citadel;Cop Morty;Aw geez, Rick. What do I know about knowin stuff? Get in the fucking car.
3;7;Tales From The Citadel;Retired General Rick;More lasers.
3;7;Tales From The Citadel;Moderator Rick;You can take more time to answer the question if youd like.
3;7;Tales From The Citadel;Moderator Rick;...Okay, Juggling Rick. How would you solve the Citadels financial crisis?
3;7;Tales From The Citadel;Juggling Rick;First off, can I just say that I think this Citadel is the greatest in the entire multiverse. Now, I believe the answer to your question has three parts.  First, education spending must get muuuch higher! 
3;7;Tales From The Citadel;Juggling Rick;But it has to be balanced with defense!  Whoa!
3;7;Tales From The Citadel;Campaign Manager Morty;Can we fact-check this, please? Never mind, who am I kidding? This race is over.
3;7;Tales From The Citadel;Juggling Rick; And thats how you run a Citadel. 
3;7;Tales From The Citadel;Moderator Rick;Candidate Morty. The number of displaced Mortys is soaring, while Rick satisfaction levels are plummeting, and the divide between the two groups has never been wider.  Solve that one real quick.
3;7;Tales From The Citadel;Candidate Morty;I dont see a divide between Ricks and Mortys.
3;7;Tales From The Citadel;Retired General Rick;Oh, shocker. 
3;7;Tales From The Citadel;Reverse Rick Outrage;Id like to offer a rebuttal. 
3;7;Tales From The Citadel;Rick Guilt Rick;Gentlemen, gentlemen! I think we can all agree on one thing.  Well, came out as two things, but you get the idea.
3;7;Tales From The Citadel;Candidate Morty;You guys finished?  The division I see is between the Ricks and Mortys that like the Citadel divided, and the rest of us. I see it everywhere I go.
3;7;Tales From The Citadel;Candidate Morty;I see it in our schools, where they teach Mortys were all the same because theyre threatened by what makes us unique.
3;7;Tales From The Citadel;Candidate Morty;I see it in our streets, where they give guns to Mortys so were too busy fighting each other to fight real injustice.
3;7;Tales From The Citadel;Candidate Morty;I see it in our factories, where Ricks work for a fraction of their bosss salary, even though theyre identical and have the same IQ. The Citadels problem isnt homeless Mortys or outraged Ricks.
3;7;Tales From The Citadel;Candidate Morty;The Citadels problem is the Ricks and Mortys feeding on the Citadels debt.
3;7;Tales From The Citadel;Rick J-22;Holy shit. 
3;7;Tales From The Citadel;Rick Worker;He's headed for the Flavor Core!
3;7;Tales From The Citadel;Candidate Morty;"But Ive got a message for them, from the Ricks and Mortys keeping it alive. A message from the Ricks and Mortys that believe in this Citadel to the Ricks and Mortys that dont,""you are outnumbered!"""
3;7;Tales From The Citadel;Campaign Manager Morty;Holy shit.  I dont believe it! I-I cant believe it!
3;7;Tales From The Citadel;Candidate Morty;I know.  Thats why youre fired. 
3;7;Tales From The Citadel;Juggling Rick;Sounds like youre looking for work. I can offer you a very enticing compensation package.  First, lets talk benefits.
3;7;Tales From The Citadel;Simple Rick; Daddy loves you Thats Daddys good girl.
3;7;Tales From The Citadel;Rick J-22; Your life is a lie, man.  All your lives are lies! Dont you get it?! They told us we were special because we were Ricks, but they stripped us of anything that made us unique!
3;7;Tales From The Citadel;Negotiator Rick; We know how you feel. Were working stiff Ricks just like you, but our assembly line is justice. What are your demands?
3;7;Tales From The Citadel;Rick J-22; I-I-I want a portal gun. Unregistered, untraceable, with enough fluid to take me off this goddamn prison!
3;7;Tales From The Citadel;SWAT Team Rick;The medias outside.
3;7;Tales From The Citadel;Negotiator Rick;Well, keep em there!
3;7;Tales From The Citadel;Rick D716-C;Anyway, so yeah, the suspect says the Citadel is a lie, built on lies, and some other shit.  I say, appreciate the life you have, because it can always be worse. Back to you, Ricks.
3;7;Tales From The Citadel;Rick D716;Thank you, Rick 716-C.  That fuckin guy.
3;7;Tales From The Citadel;Rick D716-B;Tell me about it.
3;7;Tales From The Citadel;Rick D716;Ahem. Meanwhile, in election news, an unexpected turn of events as Morty from the Morty Party soars to the top of the polls.
3;7;Tales From The Citadel;Candidate Morty;Yes?
3;7;Tales From The Citadel;Reporter Rick;Morty! Whats your original reality and wheres your Rick?
3;7;Tales From The Citadel;Candidate Morty;Gosh. We moved around so much its hard to remember. I see every Rick as my Rick.
3;7;Tales From The Citadel;Candidate Morty;I hope they see me as their Morty.
3;7;Tales From The Citadel;Campaign Manager Morty; Another, please, with less water.
3;7;Tales From The Citadel;Bartender Morty; Hey, cheer up, pal! A Mortys gonna be president.  Imagine this kisser gettin blamed for everything!
3;7;Tales From The Citadel;Campaign Manager Morty;I guess I shoulda had more faith.
3;7;Tales From The Citadel;Investigator Rick;Its not faith you need. Its fear.
3;7;Tales From The Citadel;Campaign Manager Morty;Whats this?
3;7;Tales From The Citadel;Investigator Rick; Its secrets. Wh-wh-what do you think it is?  Look at how Im dressed.
3;7;Tales From The Citadel;Rick Reporter;Taking on the system like this, are you afraid at all for your safety?
3;7;Tales From The Citadel;Candidate Morty;Id rather live in hope than fear.  If I had to fear anything, Id fear other people being afraid. Of fear. Itself.
3;7;Tales From The Citadel;Candidate Morty;But no, Im not afraid.
3;7;Tales From The Citadel;Mortytown Loco;Hey Rick, man, when theres a Morty president, you gonna lick my balls or what?
3;7;Tales From The Citadel;Bootleg Rick;Shit, grandson, you keep me peelin squap-squams and slippin nib-nibs Ill lick whatever aint nailed down.
3;7;Tales From The Citadel;Cop Rick;Hands in the air!
3;7;Tales From The Citadel;Mortytown Loco;What the hell, man? What the hell in hell?
3;7;Tales From The Citadel;Cop Morty;You guys doin a little chemistry homework with Grandpa?
3;7;Tales From The Citadel;Cop Rick;Is this what I think it is?
3;7;Tales From The Citadel;Cop Morty;Bootleg portal fluid.
3;7;Tales From The Citadel;Cop Morty;Guess his math was off. Search the place.
3;7;Tales From The Citadel;Psychopath Morty;A-Are you m-my new Rick?
3;7;Tales From The Citadel;Cop Rick;Its okay, Morty.
3;7;Tales From The Citadel;Cop Morty;Jesus!
3;7;Tales From The Citadel;Cop Rick;He stabbed me! He got me bad, Morty.
3;7;Tales From The Citadel;Cop Morty; Shh, its okay, youre okay.
3;7;Tales From The Citadel;Cop Rick;You were right  Everything I learned in the academy was--
3;7;Tales From The Citadel;Cop Morty;It doesnt matter.  Nothings wrong with putting your faith in a Morty. You just gotta pick the right one.
3;7;Tales From The Citadel;Cop Rick;Why is there a crib in here?
3;7;Tales From The Citadel;Cop Morty;Just somethin they do to make you feel bad.
3;7;Tales From The Citadel;Cop Rick;Boy, I got us knee-deep in paperwork, huh?
3;7;Tales From The Citadel;Cop Morty;Go to the car and grab a MediPack. Lemme worry about this.
3;7;Tales From The Citadel;Cop Rick;What happened?
3;7;Tales From The Citadel;Cop Morty;Same old story. Mortys killing Mortys.
3;7;Tales From The Citadel;Lizard Morty;Almost... got it... 
3;7;Tales From The Citadel;Farmer Rick;Hey, y'all get the hell away from my damn Megafruit!

3;7;Tales From The Citadel;Slick;Yeah, I bet it goes nowhere. I bet it's a big hole where the Citadel dumps all its broken dreams.
3;7;Tales From The Citadel;Fat Morty;Slick, why do ya have to be so dramatic? 
3;7;Tales From The Citadel;Slick; You wanna know why?  Because of this! I'm part of an experimental line of Mortys with a trauma implant. How do you think it feels, Fat Morty, to know that no matter where I go,  I'll always be the one that makes everybody sad and... a little bored? 
3;7;Tales From The Citadel;Glasses Morty;Slick, that implant isn't who you are, okay? You also roll up your sleeves. 
3;7;Tales From The Citadel;Fat Morty;I thought I was Left-Handed Morty.

3;8;Morty's Mind Blowers;Morty;Well, I guess its nice to know the whole family sucks! So if the blues ones are my fault, and the purple ones are my familys, what are the red ones?
3;8;Morty's Mind Blowers;Rick;Yeah, d-dont read into it, Morty!
3;8;Morty's Mind Blowers;Morty;Ahh.
3;8;Morty's Mind Blowers;Rick; We need to find shelter before the sunset, Morty. Venzenulon Nine has a night temperature of 300 below! Well freeze, Morty! W-Well be dead in seconds!
3;8;Morty's Mind Blowers;Morty;I I think I saw a cave over there.
3;8;Morty's Mind Blowers;Rick;Youve seen too many movies, Morty. A cave isnt gonna cut it. Were gonna have to use Beebo.
3;8;Morty's Mind Blowers;Morty;Beebo led us to water! Hes our friend! -
3;8;Morty's Mind Blowers;Rick;He wont even feel it! -
3;8;Morty's Mind Blowers;Morty;Oh, no, no!
3;8;Morty's Mind Blowers;Rick;You wanna die, Morty? Get in Beebo! Oh, no, no! Brace for the ice limit. Here it comes! Wait, are we on Venzenulon Nine or Venzenulon Seven?
3;8;Morty's Mind Blowers;Morty;Wait a minute, why would I ask for that to be removed? Are the red ones stuff you wanted removed?
3;8;Morty's Mind Blowers;Rick;Ooh, thats clever, Morty, but I dont use color to sort things because Im not a mouse in a European childrens book.
3;8;Morty's Mind Blowers;Morty;Then why are all those pink ones by the liquor?
3;8;Morty's Mind Blowers;Rick;Liquor? , that was close.
3;8;Morty's Mind Blowers;Morty;We lost Captain Sky. He gave his life for the uprising.
3;8;Morty's Mind Blowers;Rick;Yeah. It really makes you think, huh, Morty? We should never take things for granite.
3;8;Morty's Mind Blowers;Morty;- What? -
3;8;Morty's Mind Blowers;Rick;Im just saying, lifes short. We shouldnt take things for granite.
3;8;Morty's Mind Blowers;Morty;"- Are you saying granite""? -"""
3;8;Morty's Mind Blowers;Rick;Well, yeah.
3;8;Morty's Mind Blowers;Morty;"Its granted,"" with a ""D."" Take things for granted. Did you actually think it was Jesus Christ, Rick, what are you, a boulder A rock person? How long have you been saying that wrong?"""
3;8;Morty's Mind Blowers;Rick;Oh, you like that, huh? I b-b-bet that really blows your mind.
3;8;Morty's Mind Blowers;Morty;I mean, yeah, its kind of great.
3;8;Morty's Mind Blowers;Rick;- You want me to erase it? -
3;8;Morty's Mind Blowers;Morty;What, you can do that?
3;8;Morty's Mind Blowers;Rick;Ah, .
3;8;Morty's Mind Blowers;Morty;I  knew it, you piece of ! You You Youre a  asshole, Rick!
3;8;Morty's Mind Blowers;Rick;Take it easy, Morty, come on. Just relax.
3;8;Morty's Mind Blowers;Morty;No, Im not gonna  relax! Come here!
3;8;Morty's Mind Blowers;Rick;Let go of me, you little bitch!
3;8;Morty's Mind Blowers;Morty;Im gonna grab you by the scruff of your
3;8;Morty's Mind Blowers;Rick;Take that!
3;8;Morty's Mind Blowers;Morty;Ohh! -
3;8;Morty's Mind Blowers;Rick;Umm.
3;8;Morty's Mind Blowers;Morty;- Umm. Uhh.- What -
3;8;Morty's Mind Blowers;Rick;Whats going on? -
3;8;Morty's Mind Blowers;Morty;Where am I? -
3;8;Morty's Mind Blowers;Rick;Who are we?
3;8;Morty's Mind Blowers;Morty;Who am I? I think Im an adolescent boy.
3;8;Morty's Mind Blowers;Rick;Huh, and Im an elderly man. And we appear to be in some kind of secret confined space.Yeah, umm Dont look at me like that. For all we know, you could be the  weirdo. Huh, these things are obviously storage units, and since we cant remember what went wrong, my guess is that the technology involves memory, and that this thing on your head is designed to Tell us the code, jagoff! Its pointless. Hes stonewalling.
3;8;Morty's Mind Blowers;Morty;Rick, if we dont unlock those vaccines, Earth dies! You know, it might be time to step up your interrogation!
3;8;Morty's Mind Blowers;Rick;Not sure what youre implying, Morty, but some lines I dont cross.
3;8;Morty's Mind Blowers;Morty;Yeah, well, I crossed every line I had when this bastard tried to kill Jessica!
3;8;Morty's Mind Blowers;Rick;Okay, see those two fleshy sacs under his chin, Morty? Grab em. You remember the codes now? Twist! Give us the codes, man! Twist harder, Morty! Harder! Okay, let go, let go, let him breathe. He wants to make a deal. Half the codes now, half after you finish.
3;8;Morty's Mind Blowers;Morty;But can we trust Wait, what? F-Finish what?
3;8;Morty's Mind Blowers;Rick;Y-You know
3;8;Morty's Mind Blowers;Morty;I thought I was torturing him!
3;8;Morty's Mind Blowers;Rick;Oh, and this disappoints you? Do I tell him we dont have a deal, Morty? Because if we can kill our enemies, but we cant jack them off, then how are we better than them?
3;8;Morty's Mind Blowers;Morty;"Well, what did you find out? Were partners, I guess, and we fight aliens, like ""Men in Black""?"
3;8;Morty's Mind Blowers;Rick;"Men in Black, Men in Black. I have ""Men in Black 2"" in here."
3;8;Morty's Mind Blowers;Morty;So So you get the general idea.
3;8;Morty's Mind Blowers;Rick;Not quite. Its basically an endless string of callbacks to
3;8;Morty's Mind Blowers;Morty;All right, save it for Youtube.Ill keep looking for clues.
3;8;Morty's Mind Blowers;Rick;What are you doing?
3;8;Morty's Mind Blowers;Morty;You want your shelf level or not?
3;8;Morty's Mind Blowers;Rick;And if I say yes, youre gonna provide that for me with that?
3;8;Morty's Mind Blowers;Morty;Yes, see the bubble?
3;8;Morty's Mind Blowers;Rick;Im familiar with the bubble, Morty. I also dabble in precision, and if you think you can even approach it with your sad, naked, caveman eyeball and a bubble of  air, youre the reason this species is a failure, and it makes me angry!
3;8;Morty's Mind Blowers;Morty;Youre drunk.
3;8;Morty's Mind Blowers;Rick;You want to put up a shelf, put up a shelf You want to experience true level? Do you?
3;8;Morty's Mind Blowers;Morty;Y-yes.
3;8;Morty's Mind Blowers;Rick;Ugh, all right, come on.
3;8;Morty's Mind Blowers;Morty;Wow, its so Oh, oh, oh, oh, my God, oh, Christ, ooh, ooh, ooh, ahh.
3;8;Morty's Mind Blowers;Rick;Oh, yeah, true level, bitch.
3;8;Morty's Mind Blowers;Summer;Morty, come on, were leaving for school.
3;8;Morty's Mind Blowers;Morty;Oh, everythings crooked! Reality is poison! I want to go back! I hate this!
3;8;Morty's Mind Blowers;Summer;Whats his deal?
3;8;Morty's Mind Blowers;Morty;Cant live like this! Shh, shh, shh, shh, Morty, Morty, Morty.
3;8;Morty's Mind Blowers;Rick;Go to school, Summer. Ill go in Mortys memory and do a little Lambs to the cosmic slaughter!
3;8;Morty's Mind Blowers;Morty;Well? You seem to be in charge of what I get to remember. Why?
3;8;Morty's Mind Blowers;Rick;Good question. Morty, I need darkness to prime these optical inductors. Hit the leftmost light switch by the door for me. The left. Okay, lights on. So, did I just hear three distinct light switch clicks?
3;8;Morty's Mind Blowers;Morty;W-W-What do you mean?
3;8;Morty's Mind Blowers;Rick;I feel like the three sounds I heard could be explained by an initial erroneous flipping of a switch on the right followed by a hasty, corrective flipping of the requested switch. Then during the resultant darkness and silence, a third, shameful unflipping of the initially flipped switch. Is my assessment accurate?
3;8;Morty's Mind Blowers;Morty;Yeah, thats thats basically how how it all shaked out. Im sorry.
3;8;Morty's Mind Blowers;Rick;Ugh. All right, come on.
3;8;Morty's Mind Blowers;Morty;What?!
3;8;Morty's Mind Blowers;Rick;Come on! Grab a shovel.
3;8;Morty's Mind Blowers;Morty;W-What is
3;8;Morty's Mind Blowers;Rick;Grab a shovel! What was that? I cant find a goddamn zip tie anywhere! All right,  it! Ahh, zip tie. Why are you making me do this for you again?
3;8;Morty's Mind Blowers;Morty;Who doesnt wish they could talk to animals, Rick?
3;8;Morty's Mind Blowers;Rick;Most humans! There, Im done, just stay out of trouble!
3;8;Morty's Mind Blowers;Squirrels;Gotta keep moving. Cant stop. Up, down, down, up, up, up, down, up, stop, down. The queen needs food. The babies need food. The queen makes babies. The situation in Argentina has proven less convenient than predicted. Well have to re-destabilize their economy, refocus labor class outrage from upper to middle, foster a coup, and install a compliant regime. Same as Guatemala? Yes, but you can double time it. We need a quorum to pick a new pope, in case the Exxon/Monsanto thing falls through in Africa. Why not use chemtrails? Put a canopy on Uganda. Theyre set to agitate any mo What? That kid is watching us. So, were squirrels, hes a kid. Hes watching us like he hears what were saying. Hey, kid. Young man? Come here, little boy. Tell Daphne to run a 199 on a possible Dolittle. Little boy! Well give you wishes if you can hear us! We can make you fly and get candy.
3;8;Morty's Mind Blowers;Morty;Oh, ! Oh, !  me!  me! Rick!
3;8;Morty's Mind Blowers;Rick;Ah, , Morty, what did you do? All right, Morty, pack your shit! Thats only gonna keep em down for a little bit, Morty! You  with squirrels, Morty! We got a good five minutes before theyre backing up on our ass, Morty! We have to pack up and move to a new reality, Morty! You know I said we could only do that a couple of times! Were  over here because of these damn squirrels, Morty!
3;8;Morty's Mind Blowers;Morty;I dont know what my reaction is, but I think Im mounting in suspicion of you.
3;8;Morty's Mind Blowers;Rick;- Well, what are you gonna do? -
3;8;Morty's Mind Blowers;Morty;Im gonna remember everything! Everything! Yeah! Ow! Ah! Ow!
3;8;Morty's Mind Blowers;Rick;Well, whatd you find out? Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, what are you gonna do, kill me?
3;8;Morty's Mind Blowers;Morty;No, Im not gonna kill you. Im gonna kill myself! All those memories just erased! Sitting in this room collecting dust! W-Whats the point of going on if most of everything that happens just ends up sitting in here?
3;8;Morty's Mind Blowers;Rick;"All right, kid. I dont know much aside from the fact that Men in Black 2"" is a joyless cash grab, but I do know that whatever you have brewing around in your noggin really connected with you.I cant deny that, and I cant deny that Im inspired by your passion. I want in Suicide pact! Yes, yeah, lets do it! Together, you old son of a bitch! On three! One Two"""
3;8;Morty's Mind Blowers;Summer;You guys doing Mortys Mind Blowers?
3;8;Morty's Mind Blowers;Morty;Mortys Mind Blowers?
3;8;Morty's Mind Blowers;Summer;Grandpa, is this scenario three?
3;8;Morty's Mind Blowers;Rick;Uh, w-whats that, and w-who are you?
3;8;Morty's Mind Blowers;Summer;Oh, man, its a scenario four. Ugh,  goddamn it! I dont get paid enough for this shit!
3;8;Morty's Mind Blowers;TV;Theres a Craftsman nearby. I can smell it.
3;8;Morty's Mind Blowers;Rick;Whoa, what what
3;8;Morty's Mind Blowers;TV;Can I help you?
3;8;Morty's Mind Blowers;Rick;H-How did we fall asleep during interdimensional cable? -
3;8;Morty's Mind Blowers;Morty;Yeah, what the hell, Summer? -
3;8;Morty's Mind Blowers;Rick;Summer, you dumb bitch! How long were we out, you dumb bitch! How much interdimensional cable did we miss, you stupid bitch! How many improv TV shows with commercials did we miss, Summer? Why did you let us fall asleep? You dumb bitch! You stupid bitch! All right, Morty,  this noise.Lets get out of here and go on a classic Rick and Morty adventure.
3;8;Morty's Mind Blowers;Morty;Yeah, right, Rick, Im allin.
3;8;Morty's Mind Blowers;Summer;No wonder youre constantly fighting with each other and behind schedule.
3;8;Morty's Mind Blowers;Rick;What?
3;8;Morty's Mind Blowers;Summer;Nothing.
3;8;Morty's Mind Blowers;Jerry;Rick? Hello? Just here for my putter. Jerrys Mind Blowers?
3;8;Morty's Mind Blowers;Helicopter Passenger;Follow the boys! Were charged and aimed at Alpha Centauri, ready for transport. They fell for it! Lets send Gobo home! All right! -
3;8;Morty's Mind Blowers;Summer;Wheres dad? -
3;8;Morty's Mind Blowers;Beth;He should be here any second.
3;8;Morty's Mind Blowers;Rick;Its funny, Jerry spent his life seeking attention, but in the end, humanitys instinctive dismissal of him saved an aliens life.
3;8;Morty's Mind Blowers;Summer;He knows where to go, right?
3;8;Morty's Mind Blowers;Morty;Yep, any minute now.
3;8;Morty's Mind Blowers;Jerry;Did it work? Did you guys get Gobo home?
3;8;Morty's Mind Blowers;Morty;You have Gobo! You were supposed to bring him to the hill!
3;8;Morty's Mind Blowers;Jerry;As if. He was in your basket.
3;8;Morty's Mind Blowers;Morty;He was in your car! Oh! Oof! Dibs on his stuff. Did yoof that?
3;9;The ABC's of Beth;News Anchor;In local news, child murderer Joseph Eli Lipnip is scheduled to die tomorrow by lethal injection, his execution already drawing dozens more spectators than the death of TV news. Carla? 
3;9;The ABC's of Beth;Carla Johnson;The man that once ate his own son... 
3;9;The ABC's of Beth;Beth;Wow. Hes really getting executed after all this time. You know the son that he ate was -- 
3;9;The ABC's of Beth;Summer;Your best friend -- Tommy. We know. Stop true-crime bragging. 
3;9;The ABC's of Beth;Beth;I was traumatized, Summer. Okay, your generation wouldnt get that. 
3;9;The ABC's of Beth;Summer;Bitch, my generation gets traumatized for breakfast. 
3;9;The ABC's of Beth;Beth;It took years of therapy to even process the reality. I mean, when I was a kid, I just told myself that Tommy had gotten lost in the magical realm of Froopyland. 
3;9;The ABC's of Beth;Summer;"Froopyland?"""" "
3;9;The ABC's of Beth;Beth;My make-believe world. I know the names stupid, but it was so real to me. 
3;9;The ABC's of Beth;Rick;Arent you guys supposed to be at your fathers for custody weekend? 
3;9;The ABC's of Beth;Morty;Were not in a hurry. Dad sleeps until sundown. Can we talk a little bit more about this Froopy-- 
3;9;The ABC's of Beth;Summer;Not the bubble gun! Theres no air -- 
3;9;The ABC's of Beth;Beth;I gotta say, I am warming up to the bubble gun. 
3;9;The ABC's of Beth;Rick;You know, if youre so great at naming things, why dont you do it from now on? 
3;9;The ABC's of Beth;Beth;What? 
3;9;The ABC's of Beth;Rick;Froopyland. Was it my best work? I dont know. Does it deserve to be shit on creatively? Yeah, thats right. I agree with your look of horrified realization. You can be very inconsiderate sometimes. 
3;9;The ABC's of Beth;Rick;Here it is. You know, I collapsed a quantum tesseract to... 
3;9;The ABC's of Beth;Beth;-- Dad, I dont care how you made it. I want to know if Tommys still in there! 
3;9;The ABC's of Beth;Rick;Relax, Beth. If he is, well find him. Hell be the only sun-bleached skeleton with non-imaginary DNA. 
3;9;The ABC's of Beth;Beth;Tommy! Tommy! This is a nightmare. I cant believe you used to lock me up in this glorified chicken coop. 
3;9;The ABC's of Beth;Rick;Chicken coop? Those are procedurally generated clouds, Beth. That river is a rainbow. Literally. Come on, I-I-I put real elbow grease into this place. 
3;9;The ABC's of Beth;Beth;Well, youre supposed to put elbow grease into your daughter! 
3;9;The ABC's of Beth;Rick;Gross. 
3;9;The ABC's of Beth;Beth;Do you think something ate him? 
3;9;The ABC's of Beth;Rick;Nope. Froopyland creatures were designed to be harmless. He definitely just starved to death. 
3;9;The ABC's of Beth;Beth;I could have been the one who starved to death in here. What if Id gotten hurt? 
3;9;The ABC's of Beth;Rick;God, youre right. Im a terrible dad. Well, nothing to live for. Goodbye, cruel world!  
3;9;The ABC's of Beth;Beth;Dad! 
3;9;The ABC's of Beth;Rick;Oh, how do you like that? What kind of merciless creator makes the ground bouncy? Im gonna have to drown myself. 
3;9;The ABC's of Beth;Beth;Unh! 
3;9;The ABC's of Beth;Rick;Oh, no. Oh, the waters breathable? Who went and did that? 
3;9;The ABC's of Beth;Beth;Oh, whatever. 
3;9;The ABC's of Beth;Rick;Yeah, whatever. A dad makes a toilet look like R2-D2, and it breaks the front page of Reddit, but Im Charles Manson because I gave you your own world instead of an iPad. I think the words youre looking for are -- Aah!  Holy   This thing has claws! 
3;9;The ABC's of Beth;Beth;Yeah, I get it. Its a childproof world. 
3;9;The ABC's of Beth;Rick;No, no, seriously, this hurts really bad! This thing is sinking razor-sharp claws in -- Aah!  
3;9;The ABC's of Beth;Beth;Youve made your point, Dad. Dad? 
3;9;The ABC's of Beth;Morty;Ugh! 
3;9;The ABC's of Beth;Summer;Whose idea was this stupid custody weekend thing? 
3;9;The ABC's of Beth;Morty;I think its supposed to help prevent abandonment issues. 
3;9;The ABC's of Beth;Summer;I want to be abandoned. 
3;9;The ABC's of Beth;Morty;Yeah, Im talking about Dad. 
3;9;The ABC's of Beth;Jerry;Bienvenue a la Chez Divorced Dad. 
3;9;The ABC's of Beth;Summer;Wow, Dad. Your place looks way less like a crackhouse. 
3;9;The ABC's of Beth;Morty;Its actually clean, like a cocaine house. Dad, whats going on? 
3;9;The ABC's of Beth;Jerry;Im simply centered, activated --  
3;9;The ABC's of Beth;Morty;And telekinetic? 
3;9;The ABC's of Beth;Jerry;Pretty cool, huh? Check it out. Who wants a smoothie?  Oh -- Oh, no. Uh, oh, God. Summer -- Summer, can you -- 
3;9;The ABC's of Beth;Summer;Aah! 
3;9;The ABC's of Beth;Jerry;Sorry. 
3;9;The ABC's of Beth;Kiara;You have much to learn, my Uloo. 
3;9;The ABC's of Beth;Jerry;Morty, Summer, this is Kiara. Shes a Krootabulan warrior priestess from Krootabulon. 
3;9;The ABC's of Beth;Morty;I-I know where Krootabulans are from, Dad. Uh, Chaimuntolo. 
3;9;The ABC's of Beth;Kiara;Chaimuntolo, younglings. 
3;9;The ABC's of Beth;Summer;Hymencholo. 
3;9;The ABC's of Beth;Kiara;Your fathers mind holds love for you. I am humbled to meet in physicality. 
3;9;The ABC's of Beth;Summer;Dad, are you... 
3;9;The ABC's of Beth;Jerry;-- In love with a badass, sexy alien lady? Ha, ha, I dont know, Summer. You tell me. 
3;9;The ABC's of Beth;Summer; I wasnt going to ask if you were in love since you barely know her. 
3;9;The ABC's of Beth;Jerry;Summer. Kiara and I met on that interstellar dating service Rick was always suggesting when your mom and I were together. And things just kind of clicked. 
3;9;The ABC's of Beth;Kiara;We must move! Our reservation is at 7:00. 
3;9;The ABC's of Beth;Jerry;I hate to see her leave, but I love to watch her phase shift away. Im sure you noticed what she has three of, but guess what she has two of? 
3;9;The ABC's of Beth;Rick;Oof! All right, knock it off! Listen, Ive been giving you a pass because Im charmed that life finds a way, but -- Aah! All right, you know what?  Ouch! Oh! Unh! Ouch! God!  Aah! Agh! 
3;9;The ABC's of Beth;Beth;" Oh, yeah, this place is the safest. Best dad ever. Cant you just say, I admit it, I screwed up""?"" "
3;9;The ABC's of Beth;Rick; Uh, what would be the point of that? 
3;9;The ABC's of Beth;Beth;  You cant do it, can you? You cant just  apologize. 
3;9;The ABC's of Beth;Rick; Okay, okay, Beth, Im sorry you think you deserve an apology.  Hey, dont look at me. You let your kid roll around on the floor of a target, its gonna get stepped on.  Huh. Well, heres the problem right here. Weve got a bunch of Froopyland procedural carbons all gummed up and mixed in with real human DNA. 
3;9;The ABC's of Beth;Beth; Are you saying Tommy survived here by having sex with Froopy creatures, creating Froopy-human hybrid offspring, and then consuming their proteins, sustaining himself with an endless cycle of cannibalistic incest? 
3;9;The ABC's of Beth;Rick; Its just a working theory. Of course, if thats the case, I expect hed be worshiped as a kind of god by a medieval-level society of his least-delicious children. 
3;9;The ABC's of Beth;Lead Froopy Creature; Halt! You are now prisoners of our exalted ruler, giver and taker of life, helper and consumer of mortality, dispenser of life 
3;9;The ABC's of Beth;Rick;-- Yeah, if I could interrupt? Were way ahead of the reveal here. 
3;9;The ABC's of Beth;Beth; Yeah, just take us to King Tommy. 
3;9;The ABC's of Beth;Morty; I thought warrior priestesses could only leave Krootabulon on a hunt. 
3;9;The ABC's of Beth;Jerry; Mmm. Thank you, sweetie. 
3;9;The ABC's of Beth;Morty; I hope its not human season. 
3;9;The ABC's of Beth;Kiara; Im on Earth hunting the Varrix. I would never hunt a human. Your father and I are soul-bonded. 
3;9;The ABC's of Beth;Morty; Soul-bonded? 
3;9;The ABC's of Beth;Summer; Um, does your planet have shorter days, because you guys are moving kind of fast, no? 
3;9;The ABC's of Beth;Kiara; Sniff  
3;9;The ABC's of Beth;Jerry; Go get him, honey! Shes always hunting.  She probably knew a Varrix worked here, and thats why she said the Yelp reviews didnt matter. 
3;9;The ABC's of Beth;Morty; Dad, do you understand how serious Krootabulon soul-bonding is? 
3;9;The ABC's of Beth;Jerry; Uh, gee, Morty, I dont know. Its got such a casual name. If you want to lecture anyone about commitment, start with your mom. 
3;9;The ABC's of Beth;Summer; Oh, my God. Dad, is that what this is about? Are you rushing into a new thing to get back at Mom? 
3;9;The ABC's of Beth;Jerry; Every weekend, you two have told me to move on. 
3;9;The ABC's of Beth;Summer; Move on, like, out of bed. Like, stop using paper towels for toilet paper, not move on into a sloppy rebound. 
3;9;The ABC's of Beth;Morty; Dad, you need to slow down, rethink this soul bond. 
3;9;The ABC's of Beth;Jerry;" Why dont you just say what you really mean? You think its cool that having sex with her gives me telekinesis and you recognize shes got a hot bod like Cheetara in Thundercats,"" but youre grossed out by her avocado-shaped head and blue skin, and you think I want to put a bag and a wig on her head. After all the time and energy I spent teaching you two about race  you ended up racist."" "
3;9;The ABC's of Beth;Kiara;  Soon your world will be rid of Varrix. Tomorrow, we celebrate. 
3;9;The ABC's of Beth;Jerry; We could take the kids to the water park. 
3;9;The ABC's of Beth;Kiara; We celebrate with a hunt! 
3;9;The ABC's of Beth;Jerry; Ooh. You kids want to hunt? 
3;9;The ABC's of Beth;Morty; -Yes. 
3;9;The ABC's of Beth;Summer; -Yes. 
3;9;The ABC's of Beth;Offspring Creature; All kneel for King Tommy! 
3;9;The ABC's of Beth;Rick; Im not kneeling. Suck my  
3;9;The ABC's of Beth;Tommy; Well, hello, all! I am the King of Froopyland, but I go by another name, too. 
3;9;The ABC's of Beth;Beth; We know. 
3;9;The ABC's of Beth;Tommy; Its Tommy! 
3;9;The ABC's of Beth;Beth; -We know. 
3;9;The ABC's of Beth;Rick; -We know. 
3;9;The ABC's of Beth;Tommy; I have lived here since I was a mere child. 
3;9;The ABC's of Beth;Beth; -We know. 
3;9;The ABC's of Beth;Rick; -Got it. 
3;9;The ABC's of Beth;Tommy; I suppose youre wondering, how do I sustain myself? 
3;9;The ABC's of Beth;Rick; -Oh, boy. 
3;9;The ABC's of Beth;Beth; -No, we arent. 
3;9;The ABC's of Beth;Tommy; I always find the theater is the best way to clarify things. 
3;9;The ABC's of Beth;Beth; -Ugh. 
3;9;The ABC's of Beth;Rick; -Seriously? 
3;9;The ABC's of Beth;Beth; Oh, my God. 
3;9;The ABC's of Beth;Tommy; Players, go! 
3;9;The ABC's of Beth;Little Tommy;  I am little Tommy. 
3;9;The ABC's of Beth;Tiny Beth;  I am tiny Beth. 
3;9;The ABC's of Beth;Beth; Oh, come on. 
3;9;The ABC's of Beth;Tiny Beth;  Come with me to a magic land. 
3;9;The ABC's of Beth;Froopy Voice;Dont do it! 
3;9;The ABC's of Beth;Tiny Beth;  This is my secret Froopyland where I have no rules! 
3;9;The ABC's of Beth;Little Tommy;  I am excited. 
3;9;The ABC's of Beth;Tiny Beth;  I am jealous of Tommys friends and his Nintendo and his dad who likes him. 
3;9;The ABC's of Beth;Rick; I take it Tommy wasnt class playwright. 
3;9;The ABC's of Beth;Tiny Beth;  You want to see the Honey Swamp? 
3;9;The ABC's of Beth;Little Tommy;  Yes! Lets do it! 
3;9;The ABC's of Beth;Tiny Beth;  Well, I want to see you dead. 
3;9;The ABC's of Beth;Little Tommy;  Ow, help! Im stuck! Im covered in honey. 
3;9;The ABC's of Beth;Rick; Huh. Well, thats interesting. 
3;9;The ABC's of Beth;Beth; Fake news. 
3;9;The ABC's of Beth;Little Tommy;  Many nights have passed, trapped in this strange land. I am hungry, and all I can do to pass the time is hump. I will hump this rock.  I will hump this tree.  I will hump this beast of the land and put my seed in it. 
3;9;The ABC's of Beth;Little Offspring; I am the first of Tommys children. Eat of my flesh so you may survive. 
3;9;The ABC's of Beth;Little Tommy;  And so I did. 
3;9;The ABC's of Beth;Rick; Oh, wow. Okay. Yeah. Certified fresh. Good -- Good job. 
3;9;The ABC's of Beth;Tommy; Perhaps a demonstration is in order. 
3;9;The ABC's of Beth;Beth; No, that is the last thing that is in order! Ugh. Oh, my God. 
3;9;The ABC's of Beth;Rick; Poor Froopy character. Leave him alone. 
3;9;The ABC's of Beth;Tommy;  Ahh. Gather round, gang!  Dinner time.  
3;9;The ABC's of Beth;Rick; All right, thats it. Im outta here. 
3;9;The ABC's of Beth;Beth; What are you doing? Were in the middle of an adventure. 
3;9;The ABC's of Beth;Rick; Heres some things an adventure needs, Beth. Conflict, stakes, a way for me to benefit, and, clearly, Morty. 
3;9;The ABC's of Beth;Beth; But Tommys still in there, raping Muppets and eating babies. 
3;9;The ABC's of Beth;Rick; Yep. Luckily, thats not our problem. Time to pull the plug. 
3;9;The ABC's of Beth;Beth; Pull the plug? We have to get Tommy out of there, okay? We -- We need to do the right thing. Do what you never did as a dad -- Put in a little effort. 
3;9;The ABC's of Beth;Rick; All right, cut the high-road routine. We both saw Tommys shitty play. You pushed him in the Honey Swamp, Beth. His very happy life is in your hands. You go save him from it. 
3;9;The ABC's of Beth;Beth;  Youre gonna believe a play over your own daughter? 
3;9;The ABC's of Beth;Rick; Yes, I am, Beth, because youre not my own daughter. 
3;9;The ABC's of Beth;Beth; Oh, God, yes. Im one of infinite Beths with infinite fathers in infinite universes. Its called a hug, Dad. It wont kill you. 
3;9;The ABC's of Beth;Rick; Yeah, dont be so sure. You know why all Ricks made a Froopyland for all their little girls? Same reason I wasnt surprised by Tommys overwritten, badly structured, cheaply produced flashback. You were a scary  kid, man. 
3;9;The ABC's of Beth;Beth;  Oh, my God. 
3;9;The ABC's of Beth;Rick; I didnt make Froopyland to get rid of you, Beth. I did it to protect the neighborhood. Not in a  noble sense. It was just more practical to sequester you before I had to start, you know, cloning a replacement for every less-than-polite little boy or gullible animal that might cross your socio-path. 
3;9;The ABC's of Beth;Beth; You would rather believe Im evil than admit that you were a bad father? 
3;9;The ABC's of Beth;Rick; Oh, dude, no. No, bad father all the way to the max over here. Im a  nutcase. And the acorn plopped straight down, baby. Look at some of this shit you were asking me to make you as a kid. Ray guns. A whip that forces people to like you. Invisibility cuffs, a parent trap, a lightning gun, a teddy bear with anatomically correct innards, night-vision googly-eye glasses, sound-erasing sneakers, false fingerprints, fall-asleep darts, a lie-detecting doll, an indestructible baseball bat, a Taser shaped like a ladybug, a fake police badge, location-tracking stickers, rainbow-colored duct tape, mind-control hair clips, poison gum, a pink, sentient switchblade. 
3;9;The ABC's of Beth;Pink Sentient Switchblade; Hi, Beth, youve gotten taller. Shall we resume stabbing? 
3;9;The ABC's of Beth;Beth; Has it occurred to you that I asked you to make those things because I wanted you to spend time with me? Has it occurred to you that if I did try killing Tommy, it might be because I was jealous of his family? 
3;9;The ABC's of Beth;Rick; Wait, what? Why? Wasnt his dad, like, some kind of cannibal? Seems like it must be hereditary. 
3;9;The ABC's of Beth;Beth; Oh, my God. This is your fault. I am not a bad person. Im gonna go back in there, Im getting Tommy, and Im fixing this! 
3;9;The ABC's of Beth;Rick; Whatever you say, Stone Cold Steve Austin.  I dont know why I just said that. Doesnt make a lot of sense, but gotta stand by it. Whatever you say, Stone Cold Steve Austin. Im owning it. 
3;9;The ABC's of Beth;Morty;No, Dad! Youre not doing it right!  
3;9;The ABC's of Beth;Jerry; Cutting off their heads isnt doing it right? 
3;9;The ABC's of Beth;Morty; Theyre  clearly regenerative! I-I think you have to stab them through the heart or something. 
3;9;The ABC's of Beth;Summer; You think or you know? I thought you were the alien expert, Isaac Asi-hole. 
3;9;The ABC's of Beth;Morty; Dont snap at me! Im tired! 
3;9;The ABC's of Beth;Summer; -Me, too! 
3;9;The ABC's of Beth;Jerry; -Were all tired!  
3;9;The ABC's of Beth;Kiara; Thats the last of them. Tonight, we celebrate. 
3;9;The ABC's of Beth;Jerry; With a hunt? 
3;9;The ABC's of Beth;Kiara; Yes, for tomorrow, we hunt. 
3;9;The ABC's of Beth;Jerry;  I, uh, really have to get out of this soul bond. 
3;9;The ABC's of Beth;Summer; -What the  Dad? 
3;9;The ABC's of Beth;Morty; -Oh, my God! Duh! 
3;9;The ABC's of Beth;Summer; -Obviously! 
3;9;The ABC's of Beth;Morty; -Yeah, no kidding! 
3;9;The ABC's of Beth;Jerry; Can you guys help me? 
3;9;The ABC's of Beth;Morty; What? How? 
3;9;The ABC's of Beth;Jerry; Can I just, uh, tell her its because of my kids? You know, like, you dont like the shape of her head, or 
3;9;The ABC's of Beth;Summer; -- Thats you, Dad! Thats you! Youre a baby and an idiot! 
3;9;The ABC's of Beth;Jerry; I think thats been established, Summer. Now help me! 
3;9;The ABC's of Beth;Summer; First, I want you to admit that youre a closet racist, a beta-male sexist, and you dragged everyone into a horrible situation by only thinking of yourself. 
3;9;The ABC's of Beth;Jerry; Okay. 
3;9;The ABC's of Beth;Summer; I want to hear you say it. 
3;9;The ABC's of Beth;Jerry;  Look, Im a closeted racist, and Im sexist and selfish, and I dragged us all into my sexist, racist bad things because Im stupid. 
3;9;The ABC's of Beth;Summer; Thank you. 
3;9;The ABC's of Beth;Jerry; Now youre gonna help me, right? 
3;9;The ABC's of Beth;Morty; She just did. 
3;9;The ABC's of Beth;Summer; Yeah, clean up your own mess. 
3;9;The ABC's of Beth;Jerry; Wait, wait, what? Oh, man. 
3;9;The ABC's of Beth;Tommy;"All right, everybody. Next item on the docket -- I would like to have sex with some of you, and then eat the babies.  I thought youd like that. I do keep rolling out the hits, dont I?  Oh! Its the Magic Crayon Lady! Are you hungry? I was just about to make dinner. And by make dinner,"" I mean"" "
3;9;The ABC's of Beth;Beth; -- Tommy, Im going to take you to the real world. 
3;9;The ABC's of Beth;Tommy; Well, this is the real world. 
3;9;The ABC's of Beth;Beth; No, you dont understand! Your dad -- Uh, people think your dad ate you! 
3;9;The ABC's of Beth;Tommy; So? You doy-oy! People should eat people. Just leave me alone! 
3;9;The ABC's of Beth;Beth; Tommy, you dont understand. I have to make this right because its my fault that youre in here. Im Beth. 
3;9;The ABC's of Beth;Tommy; -Beth? -The destroyer! 
3;9;The ABC's of Beth;Beth; Oh, suck it up, Princess Incest. You fell into some honey. 
3;9;The ABC's of Beth;Tommy; Well, it tends to happen when one is pushed into honey. 
3;9;The ABC's of Beth;Beth; I respect your right to believe I pushed you. 
3;9;The ABC's of Beth;Tommy; Oh, do I get to have that? Is my reality like a little side of fries -- a little Kwanzaa youre willing to slide my way? 
3;9;The ABC's of Beth;Beth; Yes, because Im focused on saving your fathers life because Im not a petty piece of  
3;9;The ABC's of Beth;Tommy;" So, then, it should be pretty easy to say, Sorry I pushed you."""" "
3;9;The ABC's of Beth;Beth; Real easy and not necessary, since you coming home will save your dads life whereas nothing is changed by anyone stroking your batshit-crazy ego. 
3;9;The ABC's of Beth;Tommy; Sorry, forgive me. Uh, Ive been in Froopyland for quite a while. Have apologies changed? 
3;9;The ABC's of Beth;Beth; Tommy, Im sorry you think you deserve an apology. Oh, my God. Im my father. 
3;9;The ABC's of Beth;Tommy; Uh, will someone just kill this B-word? 
3;9;The ABC's of Beth;Beth;  Hi-ya! Oh, my God. Im my father! Ya! Ooh! 
3;9;The ABC's of Beth;Pink Sentient Switchblade;Its stab time! 
3;9;The ABC's of Beth;Froopies; Ooh! 
3;9;The ABC's of Beth;Math Teacher; And thats why one pussy plus two pussies makes a bunch of pussies. Come on, yall, Im trying to make this appealing to your sex-addicted lifestyles. 
3;9;The ABC's of Beth;Jerry; Hi, I need to pull Morty out of school. Come on, Morty. 
3;9;The ABC's of Beth;Bully ;Ha! You heard your daddy, Morty. you have to leave school. Wait, what are my values?
3;9;The ABC's of Beth;Summer; Dad, whats going on? 
3;9;The ABC's of Beth;Jerry; Were going to Alaska. 
3;9;The ABC's of Beth;Morty; What? Why? 
3;9;The ABC's of Beth;Jerry; Its nice there. Also, I broke up with Kiara, and she didnt take it well, and she wants to murder you two. 
3;9;The ABC's of Beth;Morty; What? Th-Then why are we walking? 
3;9;The ABC's of Beth;Jerry;Im walking because Im tired. You guys should definitely run. 
3;9;The ABC's of Beth;Kiara;  Excuse me, I just -- You know what? Im -- Im just gonna go left. No, okay, your left, thats fine. Do you know what left is, cause -- Ugh! 
3;9;The ABC's of Beth;Morty; What does your breakup have to do with us?  
3;9;The ABC's of Beth;Summer; Yeah, we chose Mom hands down. I thought we made that clear at the lawyers office and in the comments under your weird rant on Facebook. 
3;9;The ABC's of Beth;Jerry;  She kind of blames you guys for the breakup. 
3;9;The ABC's of Beth;Summer; -Why? 
3;9;The ABC's of Beth;Morty;#¿NOMBRE?
3;9;The ABC's of Beth;Jerry; Because I told her it was your fault. 
3;9;The ABC's of Beth;Summer; -What?! 
3;9;The ABC's of Beth;Morty;-What?! 
3;9;The ABC's of Beth;Jerry; Look, Im not an evil person. Im just not very imaginative!  Oh!  
3;9;The ABC's of Beth;Rick;Doo-doo butt Doo-doo-doo -- doo-doo butt No.  Doo-doo butt, doo-doo butt 
3;9;The ABC's of Beth;Beth; Hey. 
3;9;The ABC's of Beth;Rick; Hey. 
3;9;The ABC's of Beth;Beth; Um, hmm, so just, like, out of curiosity, if you were gonna make a clone of Tommy, what would you need to get started? 
3;9;The ABC's of Beth;Rick; I dont kn-- Tommys DNA? 
3;9;The ABC's of Beth;Beth; Okay, cause he, um Yeah, he didnt want to come back, so, um, he gave me this. 
3;9;The ABC's of Beth;Rick; He gave you his finger? 
3;9;The ABC's of Beth;Beth; Uh, well, what happened is 
3;9;The ABC's of Beth;Rick; -- Its okay. It doesnt matter. 
3;9;The ABC's of Beth;Beth; Okay. 
3;9;The ABC's of Beth;Rick; Thisll take about three hours. 
3;9;The ABC's of Beth;Beth; Okay. 
3;9;The ABC's of Beth;Rick; Hey. You want to help? 
3;9;The ABC's of Beth;Beth; Okay. 
3;9;The ABC's of Beth;Beth; I am wiped out. I guess Ill turn in. 
3;9;The ABC's of Beth;Rick; Cool. 
3;9;The ABC's of Beth;Beth; Dad? I feel like Ive spent my life pretending youre a great guy and trying to be like you. And the ugly truth has always been 
3;9;The ABC's of Beth;Rick; -- That Im not that great a guy and youre exactly like me. 
3;9;The ABC's of Beth;Beth; Am I evil? 
3;9;The ABC's of Beth;Rick; Worse. Youre smart. When you know nothing matters, the universe is yours. And Ive never met a universe that was into it. The universe is basically an animal. It grazes on the ordinary. It creates infinite idiots just to eat them, not unlike your friend Timmy. 
3;9;The ABC's of Beth;Beth; Tommy. 
3;9;The ABC's of Beth;Rick; Yeah, it hardly matters now, sweetie. You know, smart people get a chance to climb on top, take reality for a ride, but itll never stop trying to throw you. And, eventually, it will. Theres no other way off. 
3;9;The ABC's of Beth;Beth; Dad, Im out of excuses to not be who I am. So who am I? What do I do? 
3;9;The ABC's of Beth;Rick; My advice -- Take off. Put a saddle on your universe. Let it kick itself out. 
3;9;The ABC's of Beth;Beth;" I cant do that. The kids, Jerry, my job, and, as much as I hate to admit it, ABCs The Bachelor."""" "
3;9;The ABC's of Beth;Rick;" I can make a clone of you, a perfect instance of you, with all your memories. An exact copy in every way. Itll love and provide for the kids, do your job, and consume broadcast-network reality TV on the same allegedly ironic level as you. You could be gone a day, a week, or the rest of your life with zero consequences. The moment you decide to come back, I flip a switch, and the clones job is done. It feels no pain, it regrets nothing, and has zero chance of going Blade Runner."""" "
3;9;The ABC's of Beth;Beth; If nothing matters, why would you do that for me? 
3;9;The ABC's of Beth;Rick; I dont know, maybe you matter so little that I like you. Or maybe it makes you matter. Maybe I love you. Maybe something about your mother. Dont jump a gift shark in the mouth. 
3;9;The ABC's of Beth;Beth; I dont know if I can do it. 
3;9;The ABC's of Beth;Rick; Then stay, and luxuriate in a life you can finally know youve chosen. My secret bonus is that no matter what you choose, youre finally gonna chill the  out. 
3;9;The ABC's of Beth;Beth; Okay. I know what I want to do. 
3;9;The ABC's of Beth;Kiara;  Aah!  Ow! You cant run forever! 
3;9;The ABC's of Beth;Summer; Shes really pissed off. 
3;9;The ABC's of Beth;Jerry; I know. Its kinda hot. 
3;9;The ABC's of Beth;Summer; Shut up! 
3;9;The ABC's of Beth;Varrix; The hunters! Theyre back! Run! 
3;9;The ABC's of Beth;Morty; -Were not hunters. 
3;9;The ABC's of Beth;Summer; -We want to hide with you. 
3;9;The ABC's of Beth;Varrix; Were not hiding. Were nesting. 
3;9;The ABC's of Beth;Morty; Ooh la la. 
3;9;The ABC's of Beth;Kiara;  The children must be destroyed so that we can be together. 
3;9;The ABC's of Beth;Summer; You need to break up with her, Dad -- properly!  God damn it, Dad!  Dump her! 
3;9;The ABC's of Beth;Jerry; Okay, okay. Kiara, lets just run away. 
3;9;The ABC's of Beth;Summer; -Dad! 
3;9;The ABC's of Beth;Morty;-Come on! 
3;9;The ABC's of Beth;Summer; Just rip the Band-Aid off! 
3;9;The ABC's of Beth;Jerry; Okay! Kiara, when I told you my kids were bigoted racists who were demanding I break up with you, I lied. If anybody deserves to be telekinetically strangled, its me. Im the one who wants to break up. I -- Im not an evil person. Im lazy, Im cowardly, and -- and I do not know what Im doing. Look, I got someone pregnant at 17. Were getting a divorce. None of this is on purpose. I was excited to date someone cool because it would make my ex notice me. 
3;9;The ABC's of Beth;Kiara; I would expect nothing less from humanity -- a selfish, manipulative, dishonest species that

3;9;The ABC's of Beth;Kiara; Just hunting. 
3;9;The ABC's of Beth;Trandor; Do you really expect me to believe it has nothing to do with us? You knew Earth was my domain. 
3;9;The ABC's of Beth;Kiara; I dont like what youre insinuating. 
3;9;The ABC's of Beth;Summer; Dad, can we go now? 
3;9;The ABC's of Beth;Jerry; Hold on a second. Im starting to get the feeling that I was the rebound. 
3;9;The ABC's of Beth;Morty; Dad, you just got handed an Ex Machina. Youre taking it. 
3;9;The ABC's of Beth;Trandor; Varrix nests spread across 300 galaxies, and you just happened to pick this planet to hunt? Thats Gorgon shit -- total Gorgon shit! 
3;9;The ABC's of Beth;Summer; Were home! 
3;9;The ABC's of Beth;Beth; Hey, guys! 
3;9;The ABC's of Beth;Summer; Whats for dinner? 
3;9;The ABC's of Beth;Beth; How was Jerrys?

3;9;The ABC's of Beth;Beth; What would we do without you? I love you, Dad. 
3;9;The ABC's of Beth;Rick; Love you, too, sweetie. By the way, that wasnt time travel. There were just a couple pizzas on the counter. I grabbed them. 
3;9;The ABC's of Beth;Kiara;  Hey, Jerry, its Kiara. Listen, my boyfriend saw those texts youve been sending me, and he got pretty pissed off. If he calls you, just ignore him!

3;10;The Rickchurian Mortydate;Morty;What do you mean? Why would I be into it? It's lame.

3;10;The Rickchurian Mortydate;Secret Serviceman #4;What do I tell him?
3;10;The Rickchurian Mortydate;Secret Serviceman #3;Tell him the truth. Tell him Rick and Morty just blew off America.

3;10;The Rickchurian Mortydate;Morty;Okay. You're not going to have fun if you analyze everything.
3;10;The Rickchurian Mortydate;President;This is what they'd rather do?
3;10;The Rickchurian Mortydate;Task Force Alpha #1;It's all in the transcript.
3;10;The Rickchurian Mortydate;President;"""Treats us like Ghostbusters"". So, Ghostbusters aren't cool now? I don't recall signing that bill. ""Control freak."" ""Orders drone strikes to cope with..."""""
3;10;The Rickchurian Mortydate;Task Force Alpha #1;"""Insecurity""."
3;10;The Rickchurian Mortydate;Task Force Alpha #2;Should we drone-strike them?
3;10;The Rickchurian Mortydate;President;That would prove him right!
3;10;The Rickchurian Mortydate;Task Force Alpha #2;And blow him up.
3;10;The Rickchurian Mortydate;President;Give me the phone.
3;10;The Rickchurian Mortydate;Rick;Is this game popular with autistic people?
3;10;The Rickchurian Mortydate;Morty;Why would you say something like that?
3;10;The Rickchurian Mortydate;Rick;'Cause I'm starting to love it.
3;10;The Rickchurian Mortydate;Morty;Failure to answer is a felony offense?
3;10;The Rickchurian Mortydate;Rick;Play it cool. As far as he knows, we're still in the tunnels.
3;10;The Rickchurian Mortydate;Task Force Alpha #2;When should we reveal we can see them?
3;10;The Rickchurian Mortydate;President;We're holding all the cards right now. We don't show any before the time is right.
3;10;The Rickchurian Mortydate;Task Force Alpha #2;Awesome.
3;10;The Rickchurian Mortydate;Rick;Yello?
3;10;The Rickchurian Mortydate;President;Hi, guys. U.S. President calling. How's it going?
3;10;The Rickchurian Mortydate;Rick;Oh, hey. Just hard at work on this sex tunnel gagoo. I think it's kind of our new archnemesis, you know? It might take a while. What do you think, Morty, a month?
3;10;The Rickchurian Mortydate;Morty;Fingers crossed, a month, yeah.
3;10;The Rickchurian Mortydate;President;"You lying dicks! I see your asses playing Minecraft""! I got you on satellite! That's right. What do you have to say for yourselves?"""
3;10;The Rickchurian Mortydate;Morty;Okay, obviously, this looks bad, Mr. President.
3;10;The Rickchurian Mortydate;Rick;I mean, what doesn't look bad through an illegal spy satellite?
3;10;The Rickchurian Mortydate;President;Don't high-road me. The two of you break 1,000 federal laws a day.
3;10;The Rickchurian Mortydate;Morty;Wow, really?
3;10;The Rickchurian Mortydate;Rick;That's pretty cool.
3;10;The Rickchurian Mortydate;President;And, yes, yes, yes, yes, you save the world now and then, America returns that favor by not holding the two of you accountable to its laws.
3;10;The Rickchurian Mortydate;Morty;Oh!
3;10;The Rickchurian Mortydate;Rick;Oh! Oh, God. We... We didn't know you saw it that way.
3;10;The Rickchurian Mortydate;President;"Well, it's nobody's fault. We never had the talk,"" so to speak."""
3;10;The Rickchurian Mortydate;Rick;Yeah. I mean, the way we see it, when we show up, that's the favor to you.
3;10;The Rickchurian Mortydate;Morty;"Especially, you know, when it turns out you wanted someone to come over just because you found an X-Files"" monster in your basement."""
3;10;The Rickchurian Mortydate;Rick;As for the reason you've never, like, arrested us, we assumed you just knew that it was impossible, like, if you tried. You know, it wouldn't go well.
3;10;The Rickchurian Mortydate;President;Wouldn't go well? Can you elaborate?
3;10;The Rickchurian Mortydate;Rick;I think one of your 1,000 laws says, no, I can't elaborate. Just trust me. None of us want to go there.
3;10;The Rickchurian Mortydate;Morty;Which we'll never have to. By the way, we'll keep on saving the Earth. You know, we're... we're happy to do that.
3;10;The Rickchurian Mortydate;Rick;Yeah, but not because it contains America... because moving to a new version of Earth is a bitch and a half.
3;10;The Rickchurian Mortydate;Morty;But feel free to call us, you know, as... as, like, friends.
3;10;The Rickchurian Mortydate;Rick;Yeah, like, if you ever want to take a selfie...
3;10;The Rickchurian Mortydate;Morty;So, are we cool?
3;10;The Rickchurian Mortydate;President;Yes. Thank you, gentlemen.
3;10;The Rickchurian Mortydate;Morty;I told you, man!
3;10;The Rickchurian Mortydate;Rick;I'm impressed, Morty. That went really well.
3;10;The Rickchurian Mortydate;President;Everybody, get ahold of yourselves!
3;10;The Rickchurian Mortydate;General Rhonda;Sir, what is our new Rick and Morty policy?
3;10;The Rickchurian Mortydate;President;Our policy is, we never needed them and never will again. Today, we celebrate our independence from Rick and Morty. Everyone out.
3;10;The Rickchurian Mortydate;Advertiser;All this spring at Clothes Mart, there's a clothes sale. Come on down to the clothes section.
3;10;The Rickchurian Mortydate;Summer;I just put it on for fun. I know I can't buy it.
3;10;The Rickchurian Mortydate;Beth;Oh, come on. You look great! You're only young once. Just promise, if the results are too strong, you'll use protection.
3;10;The Rickchurian Mortydate;Summer;Really?! Thanks! When did you get rad?
3;10;The Rickchurian Mortydate;Beth;I don't know. Maybe I adjusted to the divorce and everything's new.
3;10;The Rickchurian Mortydate;Summer;I'll say. I couldn't stand you for more than an hour at a time before. No... No offense. I like it. It's great. You're like a different person.
3;10;The Rickchurian Mortydate;Beth;Yeah. Different person.
3;10;The Rickchurian Mortydate;Brazilian Agent;Contato.
3;10;The Rickchurian Mortydate;Brazilian Agent;Vamos! Vamos! Aaah!
3;10;The Rickchurian Mortydate;Rick;How do you like that, Morty?
3;10;The Rickchurian Mortydate;Morty;"Whoa! Just like ""Minecraft""!"
3;10;The Rickchurian Mortydate;Rick;Ooh, a tiny nuclear-capable species just got discovered in the Amazon. Let's go make first contact before someone else gets all their shit.
3;10;The Rickchurian Mortydate;Morty;What about this?
3;10;The Rickchurian Mortydate;Rick;South Park did it four years ago, Morty.
3;10;The Rickchurian Mortydate;Morty;They're fast.
3;10;The Rickchurian Mortydate;Rick;Or we're slow.
3;10;The Rickchurian Mortydate;Rick;"Don't do it, guys. The casualties would be in the Brazilians"", because you're Brazilian. It's a threat and a pun. Nobody gets me."""
3;10;The Rickchurian Mortydate;Brazilian Soldier;Americanos! Pressa!
3;10;The Rickchurian Mortydate;President;Oh. Hello, Rick. You're here, too. I guess this is a global crisis.
3;10;The Rickchurian Mortydate;Rick;Oh, God. Uh, Mr. President, Morty and I have the situation covered.
3;10;The Rickchurian Mortydate;President;I'm sure you did. Dismissed.
3;10;The Rickchurian Mortydate;Morty;Dismissed?
3;10;The Rickchurian Mortydate;President;Yeah, dismissed. Not needed here. You can leave and nobody will care. Have you never heard that before?
3;10;The Rickchurian Mortydate;Rick;Do you even know how to take out this kind of threat?
3;10;The Rickchurian Mortydate;President;We're not taking it out. We're going to shrink down and approach them diplomatically.
3;10;The Rickchurian Mortydate;Rick;You shrink with pills?
3;10;The Rickchurian Mortydate;President;Are you still here? Shouldn't you be going down to your next version of Earth with your selfie-craving star-fucker sidekick?
3;10;The Rickchurian Mortydate;Morty;Whoa!
3;10;The Rickchurian Mortydate;Rick;We're allowed to be here. You aren't president of the Amazon.
3;10;The Rickchurian Mortydate;Morty;Yeah, I learned about your job in school. You're a civil servant. We're technically your boss.
3;10;The Rickchurian Mortydate;President;Oh, please, Morty. You pay as many taxes as you have pubes.
3;10;The Rickchurian Mortydate;Morty;Oh, I got pubes, Commander-in-Queef. Y-You want to count them?
3;10;The Rickchurian Mortydate;Rick;Commander-in-Queef.
3;10;The Rickchurian Mortydate;President;That's it! Do it! 
3;10;The Rickchurian Mortydate;President;Recognize the rare element Sanchez-eum? We've been preparing for a Rick-level eventuality for some time.
3;10;The Rickchurian Mortydate;Morty;You mean you've been ordering other people to prepare for it, while you sat on your ass at peace summits.
3;10;The Rickchurian Mortydate;President;Peace summits are important!
3;10;The Rickchurian Mortydate;Morty;Oh, yeah! They work great! We're really drowning in peace! You suck!
3;10;The Rickchurian Mortydate;President;You suck! Task Force Alpha, prepare to shrink.
3;10;The Rickchurian Mortydate;Rick;Is there a Task Force Alpha health plan, by the way? Because if those pills are based on subatomic compression, you could get a more curable cancer just walking through the mushroom clouds.
3;10;The Rickchurian Mortydate;President;God damn it! I'll do it.
3;10;The Rickchurian Mortydate;Rick;Whoa.
3;10;The Rickchurian Mortydate;President;Task Force Alpha is disbanded. And you two aren't American anymore! I can say that. You're expatriated! If you step foot on homeland soil again, I'll treat it as an invasion. Is this supposed to be painful?
3;10;The Rickchurian Mortydate;Rick;Painful to watch. Oh, such lame shrinking.
3;10;The Rickchurian Mortydate;Morty;Oh, his clothes stay the same size? '70s shrinking, party of one.
3;10;The Rickchurian Mortydate;President;Eat my shrinking ass!
3;10;The Rickchurian Mortydate;Rick;There he goes. All right. Let's get out of here, Morty.
3;10;The Rickchurian Mortydate;General Rhonda;What the hell?!
3;10;The Rickchurian Mortydate;Rick;I made Sanchez-eum up, dumbasses. Don't believe everything you read on Wikipedia.
3;10;The Rickchurian Mortydate;General Rhonda;Stand down. He's not afraid of pirates.
3;10;The Rickchurian Mortydate;Rick;Oh! Run, Morty! That part was true!
3;10;The Rickchurian Mortydate;Rick;I-I can't talk now, sweetie.
3;10;The Rickchurian Mortydate;Beth;Oh, when can you?
3;10;The Rickchurian Mortydate;Rick;Good point. What's up?
3;10;The Rickchurian Mortydate;Beth;Remember a little while ago when you said that, if I wanted, I could, like, leave Earth and wander the infinite cosmos to figure out who I am and that nobody would ever know I'd left because you could replace me with a clone?
3;10;The Rickchurian Mortydate;Rick;Mm-hmm.
3;10;The Rickchurian Mortydate;Beth;Am I the clone?
3;10;The Rickchurian Mortydate;Rick;Sorry. What?
3;10;The Rickchurian Mortydate;Beth;Am I the clone? Did the real me choose to leave, and I only think I chose to stay because that's what I need to think because I'm the replacement Beth?
3;10;The Rickchurian Mortydate;Rick;No.
3;10;The Rickchurian Mortydate;Beth;Okay. Wait. And one more thing. If I were a clone, would you tell me?
3;10;The Rickchurian Mortydate;Rick;Beth, you know, when... when smart people get happy, they stop recognizing themselves. And you are very smart because you're very much my daughter.
3;10;The Rickchurian Mortydate;Beth;Oh, God. You're right. I'm sorry. Thank you, Dad.
3;10;The Rickchurian Mortydate;Rick;All good? 
3;10;The Rickchurian Mortydate;Beth;Totally. I'm fine now. 
3;10;The Rickchurian Mortydate;Rick;And just to be sure, you're not pretending to be convinced you're real because you're actually convinced you're a clone and you're now terrified that becoming self-aware would mean I'd have to terminate you?
3;10;The Rickchurian Mortydate;Beth;No.
3;10;The Rickchurian Mortydate;Rick;Okay. Glad I could help. See you soon.
3;10;The Rickchurian Mortydate;Beth;Aaaaaah!
3;10;The Rickchurian Mortydate;President;Where do I go? What does Th... What... What... What... What does this mean? This means nothing.
3;10;The Rickchurian Mortydate;Mega Gargantuan;Pull forward and park.
3;10;The Rickchurian Mortydate;President;Then say that, God damn it! Sorry. Bad day.
3;10;The Rickchurian Mortydate;Mega Gargantuan Presidentress;I am Presidentress of the Mega Gargantuans. We named ourselves before learning we were small.
3;10;The Rickchurian Mortydate;President;Madam Presidentress, I'm President of America, which is basically the world, but you didn't hear that from me. I've come to...
3;10;The Rickchurian Mortydate;Mega Gargantuan Presidentress;I know who you are. We've already agreed to a ceasefire with your ambassadors, Rick and Morty.
3;10;The Rickchurian Mortydate;President;Rick and Morty were here?
3;10;The Rickchurian Mortydate;Mega Gargantuan Presidentress;Of course they were here. They can shrink instantly and teleport. They told me to give you this. They said it will stretch as your cancer pill wears off and your body awkwardly enlarges at the rate of a '50s movie.
3;10;The Rickchurian Mortydate;President;Are there pants?
3;10;The Rickchurian Mortydate;Mega Gargantuan Presidentress;They said you'd prefer just a shirt. Apparently, you have a need to swing your dick around?
3;10;The Rickchurian Mortydate;Task Force Alpha #2;Rick and Morty escaped.
3;10;The Rickchurian Mortydate;President;No shit. Take me to the Pentagon. We're at war with Rick and Morty.
3;10;The Rickchurian Mortydate;General Rhonda;You'll want to make a stop at the White House?
3;10;The Rickchurian Mortydate;President;I have pants at the Pentagon, Rhonda. It's in my contract.
3;10;The Rickchurian Mortydate;General Rhonda;I mean you need to call a press conference. Israel and Palestine have announced a permanent ceasefire.
3;10;The Rickchurian Mortydate;President;What?
3;10;The Rickchurian Mortydate;Task Force Alpha #2;"They signed something called The Pretty Obvious If You Think About It"" accord. Apparently, an anonymous American diplomat took them to a ""Star Wars"" cantina, where they smoked perspective-enhancing alien pheromones through a laser hookah."""
3;10;The Rickchurian Mortydate;Task Force Alpha #3;I still say it has to be Putin.
3;10;The Rickchurian Mortydate;President;It was Rick and Morty, you fucking dunce!
3;10;The Rickchurian Mortydate;Task Force Alpha #3;But you're getting the credit, sir. Your approval rating just hit 100%. Why would Rick and Morty want that?
3;10;The Rickchurian Mortydate;President;Because they're assholes!
3;10;The Rickchurian Mortydate;President;I'm flattered, but it takes a whole team to achieve what we did today. Thank you. 
3;10;The Rickchurian Mortydate;President;Well?
3;10;The Rickchurian Mortydate;Task Force Alpha #3;They haven't been back home, sir. We've got every possible location under surveillance.
3;10;The Rickchurian Mortydate;President;God damn it! They're right here!
3;10;The Rickchurian Mortydate;Task Force Alpha #2;They're here, God damn it!
3;10;The Rickchurian Mortydate;Secret Servicemen;Code Red! We need backup!
3;10;The Rickchurian Mortydate;Rick;Everybody relax. Just waiting for you in the only room you can't blow up or spy on. So, we're not changing timelines for you, but now you have everything you want, so you can forget we exist, and we'll return the favor.
3;10;The Rickchurian Mortydate;President;You couldn't say that in a text?
3;10;The Rickchurian Mortydate;Rick;Well, since we won't be seeing each other again, my... Guys, we get it. It's a Code Red. Enough.
3;10;The Rickchurian Mortydate;Rick;My grandson has worked hard for you, and I feel like he's earned a selfie.
3;10;The Rickchurian Mortydate;Morty;Honestly, I could take it or leave it at this point.
3;10;The Rickchurian Mortydate;Rick;You're taking it.
3;10;The Rickchurian Mortydate;President;No. What kind of fratty-ass status move is that? Get out of my office!
3;10;The Rickchurian Mortydate;Morty;Seriously? You're that stubborn?
3;10;The Rickchurian Mortydate;President;He's the stubborn one. I'm protecting my country.
3;10;The Rickchurian Mortydate;Rick;Uh, from selfies?
3;10;The Rickchurian Mortydate;President;From subordination to hostile powers.
3;10;The Rickchurian Mortydate;Rick;Uh, does China know about that deal-breaker?
3;10;The Rickchurian Mortydate;President;China doesn't piss on the White House.
3;10;The Rickchurian Mortydate;Rick;Well, why would they? I'm sure it was expensive.
3;10;The Rickchurian Mortydate;President;Get out.
3;10;The Rickchurian Mortydate;Rick;Not without a selfie.
3;10;The Rickchurian Mortydate;Task Force Alpha #2;Arrest them.
3;10;The Rickchurian Mortydate;Rick;Son, you have a right to refuse his order, and I guarantee you're going to die if you touch me, and there's no afterlife. Everything just goes black. Don't do it.
3;10;The Rickchurian Mortydate;Morty;Whoa, Rick!
3;10;The Rickchurian Mortydate;President;Okay. What was that?
3;10;The Rickchurian Mortydate;Rick;Death.
3;10;The Rickchurian Mortydate;President;What kind?
3;10;The Rickchurian Mortydate;Rick;Instant.
3;10;The Rickchurian Mortydate;President;There was no sound. He just died.
3;10;The Rickchurian Mortydate;Rick;Yeah, terrifying. It's a terrifying thing to watch happen. It's called a deterrent.
3;10;The Rickchurian Mortydate;General Rhonda;You couldn't just knock him out?
3;10;The Rickchurian Mortydate;Rick;How is knocking out a deterrent? Everyone wants to be knocked out. Nobody wants to be dead.
3;10;The Rickchurian Mortydate;President;You committed murder in the Oval Office. Now you can't leave.
3;10;The Rickchurian Mortydate;Rick;That's fine. I said I'm not leaving without a selfie.
3;10;The Rickchurian Mortydate;Morty;Uh, I don't need a selfie.
3;10;The Rickchurian Mortydate;President;And I'm saying you aren't getting one and you aren't leaving.
3;10;The Rickchurian Mortydate;Rick;So we agree?
3;10;The Rickchurian Mortydate;President;Yes. No. We disagree because you think you're getting a selfie and leaving.
3;10;The Rickchurian Mortydate;Rick;Am I getting a selfie?
3;10;The Rickchurian Mortydate;President;Never.
3;10;The Rickchurian Mortydate;Rick;Then I'm never leaving.
3;10;The Rickchurian Mortydate;President;Exactly.
3;10;The Rickchurian Mortydate;Rick;See?
3;10;The Rickchurian Mortydate;Task Force Alpha #2;Does anyone have a shot?
3;10;The Rickchurian Mortydate;Rick;Yes, nine people. I can show you. But I wouldn't recommend...
3;10;The Rickchurian Mortydate;Task Force Alpha #2;Open fire!
3;10;The Rickchurian Mortydate;Rick;God, you are dumb!
3;10;The Rickchurian Mortydate;General Rhonda;Get the President out of here!
3;10;The Rickchurian Mortydate;Rick;Bad idea.
3;10;The Rickchurian Mortydate;President;Wait. Why?
3;10;The Rickchurian Mortydate;Rick;Because if there isn't someone in here that they're not supposed to kill, they're going to wreck the place trying to kill me. As long as you live, no matter where you are, if it isn't in a selfie with him, I'll be here.
3;10;The Rickchurian Mortydate;Task Force Alpha #2;Jesus! He's not a fucking god!
3;10;The Rickchurian Mortydate;Rick;You don't know what I am!  And you don't know what I can do!
3;10;The Rickchurian Mortydate;Morty;Geez, it's... it's cool, Rick!
3;10;The Rickchurian Mortydate;Rick;I'm Doctor Who in this motherfucker. I could be a clone. I could be a hologram. We could be clones controlled by robots controlled with special headsets that the real Rick and Morty are wearing while they're fucking your mother!
3;10;The Rickchurian Mortydate;Task Force Alpha #2;I'm going to kill you!
3;10;The Rickchurian Mortydate;Rick;Then come to 312 Olive Street!
3;10;The Rickchurian Mortydate;Task Force Alpha #2;Is that her address?
3;10;The Rickchurian Mortydate;Rick;You don't know because you're a bad son! Ow!
3;10;The Rickchurian Mortydate;President;Take him down! Semper fi!
3;10;The Rickchurian Mortydate;Secret Servicemen;Aaaaah!
3;10;The Rickchurian Mortydate;TV ;Number three, The Twister.
3;10;The Rickchurian Mortydate;Jerry;Ow! Damn it.
3;10;The Rickchurian Mortydate;TV ;Number four... The Hanky Panky.
3;10;The Rickchurian Mortydate;Jerry;Beth?
3;10;The Rickchurian Mortydate;Beth;My dad might have cloned me, and I might be the clone. And he says I'm not, but that's what he'd say to a clone.
3;10;The Rickchurian Mortydate;Jerry;Typical.
3;10;The Rickchurian Mortydate;TV ;Number six, The Texas Ripple.
3;10;The Rickchurian Mortydate;Jerry;You look like you to me.
3;10;The Rickchurian Mortydate;Beth;What are you, an idiot? I'm sorry. I'm sorry. That was so rude. I came to you for help, and now I'm insulting your intelligence. And look where intelligence gets you.
3;10;The Rickchurian Mortydate;Jerry;Well, don't knock intelligence, because right now I'd love to understand how I can help you.
3;10;The Rickchurian Mortydate;Beth;I can't be in charge of that, Jerry. My mind, my ideas are all part of the variable. The only constant is you. You know me inside and out. Do what you have to do.
3;10;The Rickchurian Mortydate;Jerry;Okay. Sit down. Now cross your legs. That leg on top. Good.
3;10;The Rickchurian Mortydate;Beth;Oh, what is this?
3;10;The Rickchurian Mortydate;Jerry;"Senior year, I took you on a date to the Milwaukee Symphony Orchestra performing the music of Alan Silvestri in the Park. At this point in the song from Volcano"", when Tommy Lee Jones and the utility workers are using cars to guide the lava into a cul-de-sac, I realized my palms were so sweaty, I would never get to hold your hand. But I was desperate to touch you, so I wiped my palm on the grass next to me. But a Snickers wrapper kind of got stuck on it, so I started kind of jiggling it, whipping it without moving too much. But you started looking over, and I thought, ""Well, this is it. She's going to see that I'm a loser, and I'll never get to touch her. But I still have time to touch her."" But my hand had Snickers on it, and the brass section was swelling because it was the scene with the guy melting in the lava. And I just thought, ""Fuck it. Lips don't sweat."""""
3;10;The Rickchurian Mortydate;Jerry;Wow. Yeah. I'll never forget that feeling. You're the real thing.
3;10;The Rickchurian Mortydate;Beth;Then that settles it, because my memory is of hating that night. But now, reliving it, all I can feel is how lucky I am to be loved by such a simple, honest, simple man.
3;10;The Rickchurian Mortydate;Jerry;Simple twice.
3;10;The Rickchurian Mortydate;Beth;This isn't the woman you married, Jerry, because this woman loves you.
3;10;The Rickchurian Mortydate;Jerry;Uh... well, vive la différence. Okay. That was lame. Listen, I... Words. Don Cheadle.
3;10;The Rickchurian Mortydate;President;You have the right to get the fuck out of my office!
3;10;The Rickchurian Mortydate;Rick;You have the right to kiss my dick!
3;10;The Rickchurian Mortydate;President;Give me the thing.
3;10;The Rickchurian Mortydate;Rick;Ugh! Oh! Ugh! Ugh!
3;10;The Rickchurian Mortydate;Rick;Submit! Submit for the selfie!
3;10;The Rickchurian Mortydate;President;I yield! I yield! Take the selfie!
3;10;The Rickchurian Mortydate;Rick;"Okay. Morty, get in there and say, ""Cheese"". Morty? Morty, come on! God damn it!"
3;10;The Rickchurian Mortydate;Morty;Rick, don't get mad, but I-I stole your portal gun.
3;10;The Rickchurian Mortydate;Rick;What the fuck, Morty?!
3;10;The Rickchurian Mortydate;Morty;I told you I didn't want the damn selfie 800 times! Look, whatever the hell is going on between you and the president, it's got nothing to do with me.
3;10;The Rickchurian Mortydate;Rick;So where did you go?
3;10;The Rickchurian Mortydate;Morty;I can't tell you. Rick, did you tell my mom she might be a clone? 
3;10;The Rickchurian Mortydate;Rick;No! I told her she wasn't!
3;10;The Rickchurian Mortydate;Morty;Well, isn't that what you'd tell a clone?
3;10;The Rickchurian Mortydate;Rick;Oh, for Christ's sake.
3;10;The Rickchurian Mortydate;Morty;Rick, my mom and dad are getting back together.
3;10;The Rickchurian Mortydate;Rick;What? No! She's not a clone!
3;10;The Rickchurian Mortydate;Morty;Well, she says it doesn't matter if she is or isn't because now she loves my dad, and she wanted me and Summer to come home, and we're hiding from you so you don't kill her if she's a clone, in a place I picked that you will never find. So don't look for us.
3;10;The Rickchurian Mortydate;President;Come on, bitch!
3;10;The Rickchurian Mortydate;Rick;Oh, you come on, bitch. I'm out. I'm done. I got to... I got to go.
3;10;The Rickchurian Mortydate;President;So I win. Then I'm in charge, and you can't leave. You're a terrorist. You're an enemy of the state, and you kicked me in the balls 10 minutes ago!
3;10;The Rickchurian Mortydate;President;The office of the President can't coexist with a living god that won't submit to it... I mean, besides Poseidon. But he's locked up in Area 51 already, so that doesn't really count.
3;10;The Rickchurian Mortydate;Rick;Mr. President, I'll make you a deal. If you let me use your ghetto-ass off-brand deficit-tripling teleporter, I can go take care of something, and you'll never see me again.
3;10;The Rickchurian Mortydate;President;Yes. Deal. Invisi-troopers, stand down. Yeah, yeah. I don't want to hear it.
3;10;The Rickchurian Mortydate;Rick;You know I could see them this whole time, right?
3;10;The Rickchurian Mortydate;President;Don't push it, Sanchez.
3;10;The Rickchurian Mortydate;Morty;He found us!
3;10;The Rickchurian Mortydate;Summer;I told you we shouldn't have gone to the same cabin as last time!
3;10;The Rickchurian Mortydate;Beth;Oh, we're not going anywhere. This ends now.
3;10;The Rickchurian Mortydate;Beth;Dad, if you're my dad. Of course, you're not my dad. You're here with a gun because I am a clone. I guess I have all your daughter's memories. So I guess I was her, which makes me related to her. But I don't relate to her. She left her family and me, which means I relate to them.
3;10;The Rickchurian Mortydate;Beth;So if you kill me, fine. You're not killing her. But you're killing a real family. And instead of doing that, will you just go away? Aren't there, like, infinite timelines? Can't you just move to one where I don't know I'm a clone, and where a different but identical version of your authentic sociopathic crazy bitch of a daughter can keep making you proud by being somewhere else?
3;10;The Rickchurian Mortydate;Rick;Beth, you crazy bitch. You're my daughter. I brought this here to kill Jerry.
3;10;The Rickchurian Mortydate;Beth;Oh, my God!
3;10;The Rickchurian Mortydate;Jerry;Jesus Christ!
3;10;The Rickchurian Mortydate;Rick;Yeah. Yeah, yeah. You win, Jerry. You win! No amount of genius can stop your dumb mediocre vacuous roots from digging into everything and everyone around you, and draining them of any ability to fend you off.
3;10;The Rickchurian Mortydate;Jerry;Well, it couldn't have been easy for you to say that. I appreciate it.
3;10;The Rickchurian Mortydate;Rick;Morty, where's my portal gun? Let's get out of here.
3;10;The Rickchurian Mortydate;Morty;I'm staying here, Rick.
3;10;The Rickchurian Mortydate;Rick;Are you... Ugh! Nobody gets it. Nothing you think matters matters. This isn't special. This... This is happening infinite times across infinite realities.
3;10;The Rickchurian Mortydate;Summer;Including this?
3;10;The Rickchurian Mortydate;Rick;Yes! Which is not to say that, subjectively, it wasn't funny.
3;10;The Rickchurian Mortydate;Morty;Are you going to stay?
3;10;The Rickchurian Mortydate;Rick;There's infinite timelines, Morty. Why would I stay in the one where I trashed the White House, became an enemy of America, and the lowest-status character in my idiot family?
3;10;The Rickchurian Mortydate;Summer;Because of the fart?
3;10;The Rickchurian Mortydate;President;There's still some rubble over there.
3;10;The Rickchurian Mortydate;Secretary of the Interior;"I don't think you've ever understood what Secretary of the Interior"" means!"""
3;10;The Rickchurian Mortydate;Rick;Hi, Mr. President. I'm Rick Sanchez, but not the one that did this. We Ricks travel the infinite and switch places with each other like hermit crabs, I think. I'm Fly Fishing Rick. You can distinguish me from the Rick that you had a falling-out with by my fly-fishing enthusiasm and accompanying hat.
3;10;The Rickchurian Mortydate;Rick;I hope I can be of service if, uh, you ever find the planet to be in danger. Friends?
3;10;The Rickchurian Mortydate;President;Sounds good to me.
3;10;The Rickchurian Mortydate;Beth;Kids, dinner! I got Panda Express!
3;10;The Rickchurian Mortydate;Summer;Did you get sugar chicken?
3;10;The Rickchurian Mortydate;Beth;That's kind of the only thing they have.
3;10;The Rickchurian Mortydate;Morty;I love Panda E! Thanks, Mom!
3;10;The Rickchurian Mortydate;Jerry;I'm hoping to get a piece of your sugar chicken later.
3;10;The Rickchurian Mortydate;Beth;Stop it.
3;10;The Rickchurian Mortydate;Rick;Here's your stupid hat, dipshit.
3;10;The Rickchurian Mortydate;Beth;Dad, you can't talk to Jerry that way anymore. We're a real family now. In many ways, things will be like Season 1, but more streamlined.
3;10;The Rickchurian Mortydate;Beth;Now Jerry and I are happily married parents, and the idea that I was motivated by a fear of you leaving can be eschewed.
3;10;The Rickchurian Mortydate;Summer;Eschewed? You've never used that word. Maybe you are a clone.
3;10;The Rickchurian Mortydate;Beth;It's not like Rick would tell us.
3;10;The Rickchurian Mortydate;Mr. Poopybutthole;Ooh-wee! What a season! Sorry I never showed up, but I got married. I had a baby. I went back to school and got my G-E-E-E-D.
3;10;The Rickchurian Mortydate;Mr. Poopybutthole;What did you do while you were waiting? Hopefully you didn't just fuck around and waste your life. Ooh-wee! See you for Season 4 in, like, a really long time!
3;10;The Rickchurian Mortydate;Mr. Poopybutthole;I might even have a big white Santa Claus beard and... and... and a... and a couple of grandkids, and all that kind of stuff. See you... See you then!
